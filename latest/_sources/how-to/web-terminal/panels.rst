Panels
======

A **panel** is a self-contained, themed mini-app the Web Terminal shows as a tab
beside the chat. OSPREY's own tools — Channel Finder, ARIEL, the lattice
dashboard, the artifact gallery — are all panels, and you can add your own.
A panel that takes its colors from the shared design tokens (:doc:`theming`)
matches your theme automatically, in light and dark, with no extra work. A
service that brings its own colors — most facility dashboards do — follows
the theme only once it opts in; `Theming a URL-backed panel`_ is what it needs
to do.

Enable OSPREY's built-in panels in ``config.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   web:
     panels:
       ariel: true
       channel-finder: true
       lattice: true

Where the panel rail lives
--------------------------

Open panels line up in the **panel rail**, which sits along the left edge by
default. If your team prefers the panel buttons along the top, set
``web.rail_position: top`` in ``config.yml``, or switch from the panel ``+``
menu (or the command palette) at any time. The choice is remembered per
browser, and each user's own pick wins over the configured default. (Pair it
with the retro theme for a navy-and-teal terminal — see :doc:`theming`.)

Panels backed by a URL
----------------------

An entry under ``web.panels`` can also declare a **URL-backed panel** — a tab
that shows another web service inside the terminal. This is how the EVENTS
dashboard and the BLUESKY tab ship in the
``control-assistant`` preset (a build that includes those stacks registers
the entries for you):

.. code-block:: yaml

   web:
     panels:
       events:
         label: EVENTS
         url: http://127.0.0.1:10010   # the backing service
         path: /dashboard              # optional: page the tab opens (default /)
         health_endpoint: /healthz     # optional: lets the hub report status

The hub shows the service as a tab and proxies requests to it from the same
origin, so the browser never needs direct access to the backing port.

Theming a URL-backed panel
--------------------------

A service you did not write for OSPREY keeps its own colors when you hang it
in a tab, and the terminal will not restyle it for you. What the terminal does
do is tell the service, at every moment, which theme the operator is looking
at — and it is then a small change in the service to follow along. This is the
whole of what it is told. Everything below is **version 1** of the contract
(``CONTRACT_VERSION`` in the design system's ``frame-params.js``), so a service
that follows it keeps working as later versions add to it.

**The theme arrives in the address.** The terminal opens the panel at the URL
you configured with three parameters added:

.. code-block:: text

   ?embedded=true&theme=retro-dark&mode=expert

``theme`` is the theme to paint with. ``embedded=true`` says the page is
running inside the terminal rather than on its own, which is the cue to hide
your own logo and page chrome — the terminal already draws a header around the
tab, and without this you get two. ``mode`` is the operator's Expert or Simple
preference. Read all three *before the page first paints*, or the operator sees
your default colors flash before yours settle on theirs.

**The theme is one of eight names.** ``light`` and ``dark`` for the main
family, then ``desy-light``, ``desy-dark``, ``high-contrast-light``,
``high-contrast-dark``, ``retro-light`` and ``retro-dark`` (:doc:`theming`
describes the families). OSPREY's own pages put the name on the ``<html>``
element as ``data-theme="retro-dark"`` and let their stylesheet key off it;
a service is free to map the eight names onto whatever its own styling
expects, and to treat an unfamiliar name as its nearest light or dark default.

**A change while the tab is open arrives as a message.** When the operator
switches theme, the terminal posts to the panel's frame:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { type: 'osprey-theme-change', theme: 'high-contrast-dark' }

A panel is always served from the terminal's own address, so the message is
same-origin. Check that before acting on it — ``if (event.origin !==
window.location.origin) return;`` — and repaint. The Expert/Simple toggle
broadcasts the same way, as ``{ type: 'osprey-mode-change', mode }``.

**The tokens come from the terminal, not from your copy.** A page embedded as
a panel can load OSPREY's design tokens with a plain root-absolute reference:

.. code-block:: html

   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/design-system/css/tokens.css">

The proxy rewrites that to the terminal's own copy of the design system, so
the colors a panel paints with are the ones the terminal is running — not
whichever ones the service's own build happened to ship. Every OSPREY color is
a CSS variable there, and all eight themes are defined in that one file, so a
service that restates its colors in terms of those variables gets the whole
theme switch for free.

Two boundaries are worth saying out loud:

- **Nothing happens on its own.** The terminal only *tells* the panel the
  theme. A service that never reads the parameter, the message, or the tokens
  is embedded successfully and stays exactly the color it always was.
- **No credentials cross the proxy.** The terminal strips the operator's
  cookies and ``Authorization`` header on the way to your service, and strips
  headers that would act on the terminal's address on the way back — see the
  note under `Adding your own panel`_. A service that authenticates its own
  callers that way cannot be driven as a panel, themed or not.

The Bluesky panel
-----------------

One tab covers a plan end to end, served by the ``bluesky-web`` sidecar.
**BLUESKY** (``/bluesky/``) has three views, and the queue's state — with
**Stop after current item** and **Abort running plan** — stays on screen across
all three:

**Plans** is where a plan is composed. It binds to the same shared draft the
OSPREY agent edits, so a field the agent sets glows in the form as it lands,
and a field you change by hand flows back to the agent. **Add to queue** puts
the exact revision on screen into the plan queue.

**Queue** lists what the queue server is holding, with **Start queue** and the
reorder/remove controls, plus the runs that have finished. Picking any run
opens it under Results. :doc:`/how-to/bluesky/queue` covers what those controls
do.

**Results** shows the selected run's record and its live figure, with the raw
data table collapsed underneath and a one-click CSV export.

Channel suggestions in plan forms
---------------------------------

A plan-form field that asks for a channel completes what you type: a popup
lists matching channel names — substring matches first, looser fuzzy matches
when those run dry. Arrow keys move through the list, **Enter** takes the
highlighted name, **Escape** dismisses it. The suggestions only suggest — a
name typed in full is accepted whether or not it appears in the list.

The names come from the project's Channel Finder catalog — the channel
database, or in graph mode the Turtle corpus named by
``services.graphdb.ttl_path``: ``osprey build`` writes a snapshot of it next
to the generated config, and the panel reads that snapshot — no
control-system traffic, and nothing to keep in sync at run time. A project
that configures neither shows no suggestions and is otherwise unchanged.

The feature is on by default, tuned under ``web.channel_suggestions`` in
``config.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   web:
     channel_suggestions:
       enabled: true         # the default
       max_channels: 50000   # the default

``max_channels`` guards the browser, not the build: every panel load fetches
the whole snapshot, so a catalog holding more channels than the limit is
skipped instead of shipped — the build log names the limit it hit, and the
form falls back to plain fields. Raise the limit to cover a larger facility,
or set ``enabled: false`` to turn the feature off and write no snapshot at
all. A build profile overrides these keys from its ``config:`` block in the
dotted form, e.g. ``web.channel_suggestions.max_channels: 200000``.

One staleness rule to know: editing a channel database or Turtle corpus
inside the profile's ``data/`` tree changes the build fingerprint, so
``osprey up`` refuses until you rebuild — the snapshot cannot silently go
stale on that path. A database or corpus referenced from *outside* the
profile tree is not fingerprinted; its snapshot refreshes only on the next
explicit ``osprey build``.

Adding your own panel
---------------------

The easy path is the guided skill — a coding agent follows it to produce a
panel that already meets every rule:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey skills install creating-an-osprey-panel

What the skill produces, and the test that pins panel discovery, are the panel
seam in :doc:`/contributing/extending-osprey`.

Once the panel is written and validated, drop its folder under your project's
``panels/`` directory and turn on discovery:

.. code-block:: yaml

   web:
     allow_runtime_panels: true    # off by default

On the next start, every valid panel under ``panels/`` shows up as a tab. Invalid
ones are skipped and logged, so one bad panel never breaks the others.

.. warning::

   Turning on ``allow_runtime_panels`` serves **whatever panels are on disk**.
   The Web Terminal authenticates every request, so only a signed-in operator
   reaches them — but it makes no judgement about what a panel does. Treat
   ``panels/`` as trusted code, and leave discovery off on a deployment where
   more people can drop a folder there than you would hand the terminal to.

.. note::

   A panel that reaches a backend does so through the web terminal's panel
   proxy, and the proxy is deliberately strict about credentials. On every
   request it forwards to a panel backend it strips the ``cookie``,
   ``authorization``, and ``x-osprey-terminal-secret`` headers, and it
   re-injects the operator secret *only* toward backends declared as loopback
   in your config. The practical consequence: a backend that authenticates its
   own callers with a cookie or an ``Authorization`` header — Grafana, for
   example — cannot be driven as a custom panel, because the proxy will never
   pass those credentials through to it.

   The return direction is just as strict. A panel's response is served from
   the terminal's own address, so any header that would act on *that* address
   rather than on the panel is stripped: ``Set-Cookie``, ``Clear-Site-Data``,
   ``Refresh``, ``WWW-Authenticate``, and CORS (``Access-Control-*``). A backend
   therefore cannot log the operator out, send them off to another site, or pop
   a login box that looks like the terminal's own. A redirect is relayed rather
   than followed, so the browser re-requests the new address and that request is
   authenticated like any other — unless the redirect points at a third site,
   which is refused with a ``502`` so that a terminal URL never forwards an
   operator somewhere the panel picked.

Panel layouts ("presets")
-------------------------

A **layout** is a named set of panels an operator applies in one click — "the
machine-setup view is these four panels." Define them under ``web.presets``, where
each key is the menu label and each value is the exact set of panels to show:

.. code-block:: yaml

   web:
     presets:
       "Machine setup": [channel-finder, lattice, artifacts, okf]
       "Logbook review": [ariel, artifacts]

Each layout appears under a **Layouts** section at the top of the panel ``+``
menu. Picking one is *exclusive*: its panels open and every other panel closes.
Members must be enabled built-in panels or custom panels you have declared; an
unknown id is dropped with a warning, and a layout with no valid members is
skipped. When no ``web.presets`` are configured — the default — the ``+`` menu is
unchanged, so layouts never add clutter to a deployment that has not opted in.

Layouts are just a shortcut over adding and removing rail entries, so the OSPREY
agent can achieve the same result with its ``add_panel_to_rail`` /
``remove_panel_from_rail`` tools;
``list_panels`` reports the configured layouts so the agent can honor a request
like "set up for machine setup."

.. dropdown:: Going deeper — how panels work
   :icon: package

   You only need this to write a panel by hand or wire a new one into the hub;
   the ``creating-an-osprey-panel`` skill and the source (which the panel
   validator and its browser test suite back) are the real reference. The rough
   idea:

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Authoring rules

         A panel is one HTML entry point plus a ``manifest.json`` (its id, label,
         entry file, and version). Two rules make it theme itself for free, and a
         validator enforces both: it must **boot the shared theme before the page
         paints** (so it never flashes the wrong colors), and it must use **only
         design tokens** for color — never a raw hex value. Copy OSPREY's
         reference panel and you start compliant.

      .. tab-item:: Serving & discovery

         Discovered panels are served straight from disk, from the same origin as
         the terminal — no proxy. Discovery is **fail-closed**: only a fully valid
         panel is ever served. The ``allow_runtime_panels`` switch is deliberately
         off by default because it is also what lets the agent register panels at
         runtime — turning it on is your explicit decision to trust the panels the
         terminal makes available.

      .. tab-item:: Embedding contract

         The hub and its panels coordinate over a small shared contract — enough
         for a panel to pick up the current theme and to hide its own logo when
         embedded, so it sits flush inside the hub instead of showing two titles.
         The browser test suite is the exact, up-to-date spec; this is only the
         shape of it.
