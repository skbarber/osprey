Web Terminal
============

The OSPREY Web Terminal is a browser-based cockpit for the Osprey agent: a real
terminal on the left, your live workspace on the right, and themed side panels
for your control-system tools. Launch it from any project directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey web

It opens in your browser at ``http://127.0.0.1:10100``. The command prints a
login URL (``…/?token=…``) at startup that signs you in for 12 hours by
default, browser restarts included, and then redirects to that clean address;
the token is the server's own secret, so treat the URL like a password. From
there you chat with the agent, watch files and plots appear the moment they are
created, and switch between companion tools without ever leaving the page.

   .. grid-item-card:: Run it
      :link: operate
      :link-type: doc
      :shadow: md

      Launch it, run it in the background, and change the handful of settings
      that matter.

   .. grid-item-card:: Theming
      :link: theming
      :link-type: doc
      :shadow: md

      Pick a light or dark theme for every OSPREY interface at once — or design
      your own.

   .. grid-item-card:: Panels
      :link: panels
      :link-type: doc
      :shadow: md

      Add your own tools as themed side panels that sit beside the chat.

   .. grid-item-card:: Multi-user
      :link: multi-user/index
      :link-type: doc
      :shadow: md

      Serve a whole team from one host — a landing page plus a private
      containerized terminal per user, in capability tiers.
