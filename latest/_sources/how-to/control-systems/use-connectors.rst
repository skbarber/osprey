.. _how-to-use-connectors:

Use Connectors
==============

A connector is OSPREY's single interface to a control system, and a second,
parallel connector is its interface to an archiver. Everything above them — the
agent, the plans, the safety layers — is written against those two interfaces,
so moving from a mock to real hardware is a change of ``control_system.type``
and its connector block, not of code.

One API, whatever the machine
-----------------------------

The Python API is the same for every connector. The mock connector answers for
**any** channel name without hardware access, which is what makes it the
development and R&D default:

.. code-block:: python

   from osprey.connectors.factory import ConnectorFactory

   # Create mock connector - works with ANY channel names
   connector = await ConnectorFactory.create_control_system_connector({
       'type': 'mock',
       'connector': {
           'mock': {
               'response_delay_ms': 10,
               'noise_level': 0.01
           }
       }
   })

   channel_value = await connector.read_channel('ANY:MADE:UP:NAME')
   print(f"Value: {channel_value.value} {channel_value.metadata.units}")

   # A state channel (EPICS mbbi/bi/bo, PVAccess NTEnum) reads as its integer
   # state index, with the state names alongside it:
   mode = await connector.read_channel('SR:DIAG:MODE')
   print(f"{mode.value} means {mode.metadata.enum_label}")   # e.g. 2 means ACQUIRING
   print(mode.metadata.enum_labels)  # ['OFFLINE', 'STANDBY', 'ACQUIRING', 'FAULT']

   await connector.disconnect()

Everything below is configuration only — which machine sits behind that API.

.. note::

   Write operations require explicit opt-in, per connector type.
   See :ref:`write-safety-config` in :doc:`/reference/contracts/connectors` for
   the ``writes_enabled`` settings that control write permissions.

Pick a control system
---------------------

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: cs

   .. tab-item:: Mock
      :sync: mock

      The default. Synthetic values for any channel name, no hardware or
      network access required:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         control_system:
           type: mock
           connector:
             mock: { response_delay_ms: 10, noise_level: 0.01 }

   .. tab-item:: EPICS
      :sync: epics

      EPICS Channel Access, pointed at a gateway:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         control_system:
           type: epics
           connector:
             epics:
               gateways:
                 # EPICS uses one process-wide CA context, so the connector points at a
                 # single gateway. When writes are armed for this connector type and a
                 # write_access gateway is set, writes route through it; otherwise the
                 # connector uses read_only (so a read-only deployment rejects writes at
                 # the network layer as well).
                 read_only:   { address: cagw.facility.edu, port: 5064 }
                 write_access: { address: cagw.facility.edu, port: 5084 }
               timeout: 5.0

      .. rubric:: PVAccess channels (PVA)

      The ``epics`` connector speaks Channel Access by default. Some data --
      camera frames above all -- is served only over pvAccess, EPICS' second
      protocol. List those addresses as glob patterns under ``pva_channels``
      and the connector reads them through pvAccess, while every other address
      keeps using Channel Access. One deployment covers both:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         control_system:
           type: epics
           connector:
             epics:
               timeout: 5.0
               pva_channels:
                 - "*:IMAGE*"
                 - "BL:CAM?:ARRAY"
               pva_gateway:
                 address: pvagw.facility.edu
                 port: 5075               # default
                 use_name_server: false
               gateways:
                 read_only: { address: cagw.facility.edu, port: 5064 }

      Patterns are matched with ``fnmatch.fnmatchcase`` -- case-sensitive, and
      the same on every operating system. Addresses stay exactly as you write
      them: no ``pva://`` prefix is ever added, so the limits database, channel
      databases and audit records keep matching the strings they already use.
      An absent or empty ``pva_channels`` list is a complete no-op -- the
      connector behaves exactly as it did before and never even imports the
      pvAccess client.

      ``pva_gateway`` is a single flat block, unlike the ``read_only`` /
      ``write_access`` pair on the Channel Access side, because pvAccess is
      read-only here. The block is only consulted when ``pva_channels`` is
      non-empty, and it becomes ``EPICS_PVA_ADDR_LIST`` in the form
      ``address:port`` -- or ``EPICS_PVA_NAME_SERVERS``, same form, when
      ``use_name_server`` is true, which makes the client connect over TCP
      instead of searching by UDP broadcast (that is what an SSH tunnel needs).
      Whenever the block is present, ``EPICS_PVA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST`` is forced to
      ``"NO"`` -- the same containment the Channel Access side applies, so a
      deployment deliberately pinned to one gateway cannot also
      broadcast-discover servers on the local subnet.

      **PVA channels are read-only.** A write to an address matching a
      ``pva_channels`` pattern comes straight back as a blocked
      ``ChannelWriteResult`` naming the reason, with nothing sent on the
      network. That is a deliberate safety decision rather than an unfinished
      feature: a supervised pvAccess write path is separate work with its own
      review, and until it exists a refusal is the honest answer.

      pvAccess **RPC services** are refused too, and for a different reason.
      Code the agent runs through the Python executor cannot call
      ``Context.rpc(...)``: it is blocked at runtime and no approval can let it
      through, because an rpc payload carries an arbitrary request -- there is
      no way to tell a read from a write, and nothing for limits checking to
      validate. Use ``channel_read`` and ``channel_write`` for the operation
      you actually need.

      A camera frame is almost always too large to return to the agent as raw
      numbers; see :doc:`/reference/contracts/connectors` for what comes back
      instead.

      .. note::

         Compressed NTNDArray frames are not decoded. When a camera's
         areaDetector pvAccess plugin is configured with a codec (blosc, lz4,
         jpeg), the read fails with an error naming the codec and the remedy --
         disable pvAccess compression for that channel -- rather than reshaping
         a compressed blob into a plausible-looking image full of meaningless
         statistics.

      .. note::

         The pvAccess client (``p4p``) ships with OSPREY as an ordinary
         dependency, so there is normally nothing to install. The exception is
         a bare-metal install on arm64 Linux, where ``p4p``, ``pvxslibs`` and
         ``epicscorelibs`` publish no wheels and pip builds them from source:
         that host needs a C toolchain (a compiler and ``make``) present.
         OSPREY's own project images already stage one, so containerized
         deployments are unaffected.

   .. tab-item:: DOOCS
      :sync: doocs

      DOOCS (DESY, European XFEL). Channel addresses are DOOCS properties
      (``FACILITY/DEVICE/LOCATION/PROPERTY``), and the connector needs no
      options -- it reads its environment from the DOOCS installation:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         control_system:
           type: doocs

      The connector requires ``doocs4py``, which the DOOCS environment
      provides rather than PyPI. The import is deferred to ``connect()``, so
      the name registers everywhere and only fails -- with a clear
      ``ImportError`` instead of a silent degradation -- where a DOOCS
      environment is genuinely absent.

      .. note::

         DOOCS confirms a write the way every connector does: one fresh read
         of the channel, compared exactly against the value that was sent. A
         reading that is not a number -- a string, a name -- confirms by
         plain equality.

   .. tab-item:: Virtual Accelerator
      :sync: va

      The containerized simulator, over real EPICS Channel Access -- it behaves
      like ``epics`` but tracks setpoints through the simulator's LUME-backed
      physics, so correctors move, BPMs respond, and plans actually run (the
      mock connector can't do that):

      .. code-block:: yaml

         control_system:
           type: virtual_accelerator

      See :doc:`use-virtual-accelerator` for running it and
      :doc:`/architecture/virtual-accelerator` for how it works.

   .. tab-item:: Your own
      :sync: custom

      LabVIEW, Tango, MOAT, or any other stack OSPREY does not ship a
      connector for: write a custom connector against the same interface and
      register it with ``ConnectorFactory``. It then selects by name exactly
      like the in-tree ones. The seam -- the class to subclass, the pinning
      test, and how registration works -- is documented in
      :doc:`/contributing/extending-osprey`.

Pick an archiver
----------------

Historical data goes through a parallel ``archiver:`` block, chosen
independently of the control system:

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: cs

   .. tab-item:: Mock
      :sync: mock

      Synthetic history for any channel — the development default:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         archiver:
           type: mock_archiver

   .. tab-item:: EPICS
      :sync: epics

      The EPICS Archiver Appliance:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         archiver:
           type: epics_archiver
           epics_archiver:
             url: https://archiver.facility.edu:8443   # required
             timeout: 60                                # seconds, default 60

   .. tab-item:: DOOCS
      :sync: doocs

      DOOCS *local histories* — only meaningful alongside ``type: doocs``, and
      needing the same environment-supplied ``doocs4py``:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         archiver:
           type: doocs_archiver
           doocs_archiver:
             avg_window: 20    # optional moving average, in samples

   .. tab-item:: MongoDB
      :sync: mongodb

      For facilities that store time-series PV data in MongoDB rather than an
      EPICS Archiver Appliance:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         archiver:
           type: mongodb_archiver
           mongodb_archiver:
             host: mongodb.facility.edu
             port: 27017
             name: archiver_db
             collection: pv_data
             auth: admin
             username: readonly
             password_env: MONGODB_READONLY_PASSWORD

      Documents in the collection are expected to have a ``date`` field
      (``ISODate``) and one or more PV names as top-level fields:
      ``{date: ISODate(...), PV1: value1, PV2: value2, ...}``. A query matches
      any document that carries **at least one** of the requested PVs (an
      ``$or`` across per-PV ``$exists`` checks) -- documents do not need to
      carry every requested PV together, so channels archived at different
      cadences, or written into separate documents by different collectors,
      are still returned correctly, each on its own timestamp series. The
      connector's MongoDB client ships with OSPREY, so there is nothing extra
      to install.

Contracts and Custom Connectors
-------------------------------

The behaviour every connector has to implement -- how large array values come
back, how a write reports whether it took effect and which safety gates it must
pass first, and what an archiver's historical data must look like -- is
documented in :doc:`/reference/contracts/connectors`.

To write, register and test a connector — control system or archiver — for a
system OSPREY does not ship, see :doc:`/contributing/extending-osprey`.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/reference/contracts/connectors`
       Connector contracts: reading large values, write confirmation and its
       safety gates, and the archiver ``get_data`` contract.
