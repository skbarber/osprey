Plans and the Queue
===================

Three sentences carry everything on this page. Plans live in a **queue
server** that survives restarts — not in the agent, not in the panels. Adding
a plan to the queue and starting the queue are **two separate, deliberate
steps**, and only starting is guarded. **Stopping is never locked** — no
token, no switch, no state can take the stop and abort buttons away.

Everything below is the same queue seen from three sides — pick the one you
work in.

One queue, three ways to drive it
=================================

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Panels

      The **PLAN** tab composes; the **BLUESKY** tab runs and watches.

      - **Add to queue** (PLAN) — queues exactly the draft on your screen,
        after a confirming click. Nothing moves.
      - **Start queue** (BLUESKY) — one click; drains every queued item, in
        order.
      - **Stop after current item** and **Abort running plan** (BLUESKY) —
        always clickable, in every state. Abort asks for a second,
        confirming click.
      - Every queued row has reorder (↑ ↓) and remove (✕) buttons — the queue
        is editable right up until it runs.
      - A **Simple mode** hides the expert details and leaves the essentials:
        the form, the queue, the results, and the halts.

      See :doc:`/how-to/web-terminal/panels` for where these tabs live.

   .. tab-item:: Chat with the agent

      Ask in plain language — "queue that plan and start it", "stop the
      queue", "abort the plan" — and the agent drives the same queue with a
      small set of tools:

      - ``get_draft`` / ``set_draft`` — compose the shared draft you see in
        BLUESKY's Plans view.
      - ``queue_add`` / ``queue_start`` — the two steps. Both ask for your
        approval, and both are switched off entirely while the project's
        control-system writes are disabled.
      - ``queue_stop`` / ``stop_run`` — the two halts. Never switched off.
      - ``queue_list`` / ``queue_status`` / ``list_runs`` / ``get_run_data``
        — read what is queued, running, and measured.
      - ``get_run_figure`` — read the same figure the BLUESKY panel is
        drawing, so you and the agent are discussing one picture.

      A bundled skill (``operating-bluesky-plans``) teaches the agent this
      flow, so you rarely need to name a tool yourself.

   .. tab-item:: HTTP API

      The panels and the agent both talk to the **Bluesky bridge**, and your
      own tooling can too:

      .. code-block:: text

         POST /queue/items          add the current draft revision
         POST /queue/start          start draining (needs the launch token)
         POST /queue/stop           stop after the running item
         POST /queue/abort          abort the running plan — never gated
         GET  /queue                what is queued and running
         GET  /runs                 recent runs; /runs/<id>/data for the numbers,
                                    /runs/<id>/figure for the plotted view

      Every refusal comes back with a ``detail`` object of the form
      ``{"code": ..., "detail": ...}`` — a stable code for software to
      branch on, a sentence for a human to read. The panels and the agent
      show that same sentence, so every surface describes the same event
      the same way.

Managing the queue
==================

The queue is a plan of what the machine is about to do, and it stays
editable while idle: reorder items, remove them, keep adding. Two honest
quirks worth knowing:

- **Progress can be absent, and absent is not zero.** Plans that cannot
  predict their total point count report "N points so far" rather than a
  made-up percentage.
- **The run list is recent history, not the archive.** A run the list has
  forgotten still has its data — see *Where the data lives* below.

.. dropdown:: What needs arming — the full picture
   :color: info
   :icon: shield-check

   The **launch token** is a credential the deployment holds; it guards
   exactly the operations that send work toward hardware.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 55 45

      * - Operation
        - What it needs
      * - Compose or edit the shared draft
        - Nothing — composing never touches hardware.
      * - Add to an **idle** queue
        - Nothing — the item just waits. (One exception: a queue server
          configured to start itself — never OSPREY's setup — makes every
          add an armed one.)
      * - Add while the queue is **running**
        - The launch token — this hands work straight to a moving machine.
      * - Start the queue
        - The launch token.
      * - Stop the queue / abort the running plan
        - Nothing. Ever. Anywhere.
      * - Withdraw a pending stop
        - The launch token — it lets the queue keep draining.

   The agent is held to a harder rule on top of this: where the project may
   write to no control target at all, its ``queue_add`` and ``queue_start``
   tools are denied outright — it cannot queue or start anything, even on an
   idle queue. Its halts and its read tools are never taken away.

   Write posture is per control target, and each queue lane is bound at build
   time to one target, so a deployment can arm the lane that drives the
   simulator and leave the lane that drives the live machine unarmed. Nothing
   is denied up front on such a deployment — the deny list is written once,
   before a session picks a target — and ``queue_add`` and ``queue_start``
   refuse per call instead, with ``writes_disabled``, naming the lane's machine.

   In a deployed control room the agent holds the launch token only where the
   deployment grants it, and it is granted **per lane**: to a persona whose
   config arms writes for the machine that lane drives and that also runs the
   bluesky MCP server. A persona can hold the simulator lane's token and none
   for the live one. Where it is granted, the agent's
   ``queue_start`` arms the queue itself, and your approval of that tool call
   is the arming decision. Where it is not, ``queue_start`` is refused with
   ``launch_token_required`` and the start stays with you, from the BLUESKY
   queue panel's own **Start queue** button.

   On a two-lane deployment the BLUESKY panel carries a **lane picker** in its
   status strip, labelled by the machine each lane drives. The panel is bound
   to one lane at a time — plans, shared draft, queue and results all follow
   the picked lane, and its Start queue button arms with that lane's own
   token — so what you see and what a click starts can never belong to two
   different machines.

.. dropdown:: When something is refused
   :color: info
   :icon: alert

   A refusal always says why. The codes you will actually meet:

   ``stale_draft_revision`` / ``draft_revision_already_launched``
      The draft changed since you looked, or that exact revision has already
      been queued once. Re-read the draft; edit it to mint a fresh revision
      for a repeat.

   ``launch_token_required``
      The operation was armed and the caller held no valid token. Nothing was
      started. An agent meets this where the deployment did not grant it a
      token, where the token it holds does not match the bridge's, or where
      no launch token is configured at all — hand the start to the operator.

   ``browse_only_connector``
      This deployment cannot execute plans at all — it is pointed at the
      ``mock`` control system. Composing still works; the refusal names the
      command that switches to an executing connector.

   ``session_plan_unvalidated``
      An agent-written plan must pass validation, byte for byte, before it
      runs — see :doc:`write-plans`.

   ``interrupted_item_in_queue``
      The queue still holds a plan someone stopped — see the next dropdown.

   ``manager_unreachable``
      The queue server is not answering — often it is simply still starting.
      Wait a moment and retry.

.. dropdown:: After an emergency stop
   :color: info
   :icon: stop

   A stopped plan does not vanish. The queue server records the run in
   history **and puts a copy of the item back at the front of the queue**, so
   a human can decide what happens next. Until that copy is removed, every
   attempt to start the queue is refused — a plan someone emergency-stopped
   can never sneak back onto the machine.

   Removing it is the deliberate step: the ✕ on its queue row, or the
   assistant's ``queue_remove`` tool — which asks for your approval, so the
   decision stays yours either way. To actually run it again afterwards,
   stage it through the draft and add it afresh.

.. dropdown:: Where the data lives
   :color: info
   :icon: database

   - **While a plan runs**, the panels and the agent read live rows from the
     bridge's own buffer.
   - **After that**, the data is durable in **Tiled**, the deployment's data
     store (part of the tutorial preset; optional elsewhere) — it outlives
     the run list, the queue server's history, and any restart. A run id
     whose entry has aged out of the list still answers with its data.
   - **The queue itself** lives in the queue server's own storage, so a
     bridge restart changes nothing about what is queued. The one gap: live
     rows of a run that is happening *during* a bridge restart are missing
     from the live view until the next run starts — the run itself keeps
     going and its data still lands in Tiled.

.. dropdown:: For deployers — what is running
   :color: info
   :icon: server

   A project built from the ``control-assistant`` preset brings the whole
   stack up with ``osprey up``: the **bridge** (the HTTP front door,
   port 10080), the **queue server** with its own storage, the **bluesky-web**
   sidecar serving the BLUESKY panel (port 10071), the **Virtual Accelerator** (the
   preset's default control system), and — when enabled — **Tiled** (port
   10070). Those are the deployment's port layout at its default base
   (:ref:`reference-ports`). The launch token is minted automatically at deploy
   time and stored in the project's ``.env``.

   The build profile's ``bluesky:`` block can pin those ports, and sets the
   Tiled store, which plans the catalog carries, and the device file plans may
   drive or record — see :doc:`/reference/configuration/profile`.

   Whether a deployment can execute plans at all is decided by its control
   system: ``virtual_accelerator`` and ``epics`` can, ``mock`` is
   browse-only. The panels and the agent both surface this as a capability
   banner; on a browse-only deployment it names the flip:

   .. code-block:: bash

      osprey set connector=virtual_accelerator

   Run ``osprey build`` and ``osprey up`` afterwards to carry the change into
   the running stack. That switch needs a real archive behind it: a deployment
   created from the ``control-assistant`` preset has one and the flip just
   works; one still reading the mock archiver is refused at build time, and told
   to point ``archiver.type`` at a store its deployment writes first — see
   :doc:`../control-systems/use-virtual-accelerator`.

   One timing detail worth knowing: the channel limits a plan's writes are
   checked against come from the file
   ``control_system.limits_checking.database_path`` names, and ``osprey build``
   stages its **own copy** of that file for the plan lane. So widening or
   tightening a limit in your deployment repository reaches the queue server at
   the next ``osprey build`` (and ``osprey up``) — not the moment you save the
   file.
