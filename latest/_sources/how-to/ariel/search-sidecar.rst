.. _qmd-search-sidecar:

============================
The Search Sidecar (``qmd``)
============================

``qmd`` is a service that indexes the deployment's **markdown corpora** and
answers hybrid keyword-plus-semantic queries over HTTP. Two parts of OSPREY
use it:

* ARIEL's logbook mirror --- the ``hybrid`` :doc:`search mode
  <search-modes>` and the ``hybrid_search`` MCP tool;
* the :doc:`facility-knowledge (OKF) bundle <../facility-knowledge/okf-bundle>`
  --- its panel and its MCP ``search`` tool.

One query fans out into a keyword and a vector sub-query, merges them into a
bounded candidate pool, and optionally re-scores that pool with a small language
model before returning hits:

   :alt: A qmd query: lex and vec sub-queries merge into a bounded candidate pool, optionally reranked by a small language model before returning top hits.

   Inside one qmd query. ``rerank`` and ``candidate_limit`` are the two knobs
   the configuration below exposes.

   Inside one qmd query. ``rerank`` and ``candidate_limit`` are the two knobs
   the configuration below exposes.

The greyed ``hyde`` branch ships in the image but nothing in OSPREY calls it.

It is entirely self-contained --- its language models are baked into the image,
so unlike the ``semantic`` search mode it needs no Ollama on the host --- and
the ``ariel-standalone`` and ``control-assistant`` templates deploy it **by
default**, together with its two ARIEL consumers (the ``qmd_export``
enhancement module and the ``hybrid`` search mode). The OKF bundle needs only
``facility_knowledge.bundle_path``, which it already has.

The image is built locally, never pulled. ``osprey build`` renders
``./services/qmd``; ``osprey up`` builds the image on first run and tags it
``<project>-qmd:local``, project-prefixed so two OSPREY projects on one host
cannot race for one tag. The baked-in models make that first build about
2.1 GB of download; later runs reuse the local tag. A host with no route to
the internet can supply the models itself --- see `Building without egress`_.

Configuration
-------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   services:
     qmd:
       path: ./services/qmd
       port: 10060     # host port clients talk to
       interval: 30    # fallback corpus-sweep period, seconds

   deployed_services:
     - qmd

Those three keys are the whole schema for a host that can reach the internet;
a fourth, ``models_dir``, covers one that cannot (see `Building without
egress`_). Notably **there is no ``bind_address`` here** --- see `Where the
sidecar listens`_ below.

Neither consumer strictly needs the sidecar --- OKF search falls back to
substring matching and hybrid logbook search reports an outage --- so a
deployment that does not want a second index can switch it off. That is three
edits, not one, because any subset leaves either a container nobody queries or
a search mode with nothing to search: comment out the ``qmd:`` entry under
``services:`` and the ``- qmd`` line under ``deployed_services:``, and disable
both ``ariel.search_modules.hybrid`` and
``ariel.enhancement_modules.qmd_export``.

``interval`` is a ceiling on staleness, not the usual lag: a corpus writer
touches a ``.qmd-touch`` marker file and the sidecar re-indexes within one poll.
The interval only catches writers that forgot to touch it. Raise it on a large
corpus --- a sweep that finds nothing changed still costs about 12.5 seconds at
135,000 documents, so the 30-second default leaves the loop busy roughly 42% of
the time discovering nothing.

Building without egress
-----------------------

Downloading the three model files is the one step of the image build that
reaches the internet, so on a host without egress the build stalls there.
``models_dir`` names a host directory that already holds those three files:

.. code-block:: yaml

   services:
     qmd:
       path: ./services/qmd
       models_dir: /opt/qmd-models   # absolute path, three GGUF files

One key does both halves of the job --- the build skips the download, and the
directory is bind-mounted read-only where the image expects to load models
from. Setting only one half would leave the container with no models at all,
which is why it is a single key rather than two.

Skipping the download does not skip verification, it moves it: the checksums
travel with the image, and the entrypoint checks all three files on every
start. A missing or misnamed file is refused before compose runs, by a
deploy-time check that looks for the three expected filenames --- rather than
surfacing an hour later as a container that never became healthy.

What gets mounted
-----------------

Each corpus is bind-mounted **read-only** into the sidecar at
``/corpus/<collection>``, and the same list generates the sidecar's collection
config --- so a corpus can never end up mounted without a collection, or
declared without a mount. Read-only is deliberate: the sidecar indexes these
trees, and everything that *writes* them lives outside the container.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40 40

   * - Collection
     - Source
     - Present when
   * - ``okf``
     - ``facility_knowledge.bundle_path``
     - the bundle path is set
   * - ``ariel``
     - ``ariel.enhancement_modules.qmd_export`` → ``mirror_path``
     - the export is enabled and names a path

The index itself lives in a named volume rather than a bind mount. It is
derived data the sidecar owns end to end, it is large, and rebuilding it costs
about **41 minutes** at ALS scale --- which is precisely why it must survive a
container recreate. The service's health check allows a one-hour start period
for the same reason: the sidecar refuses to open its port until the index is
built and provably non-empty, and a container that is working correctly should
not be reported unhealthy for most of its first hour.

Sharing the knowledge bundle
----------------------------

The OKF bundle is different from the other corpora: web terminals write to it.
So the *deployment's* bundle is bind-mounted **read-write** into every
``web-<user>`` service whose persona enables facility knowledge, at a target
computed from that persona's own project directory inside its container. There
is one directory, not a copy per user --- and it deliberately **shadows the
copy baked into each persona image**, because the bundle is operational
knowledge that changes far more often than images are rebuilt.

Sharing it works through a Unix group, and ``osprey up`` sets both halves up:

* The shared corpus directory is made **setgid and group-writable** (mode
  ``2770`` --- note that the ``other`` triad is deliberately left unset). An
  operator's pre-existing directory only ever *gains* bits here; it never
  loses any.
* Each entitled ``web-<user>`` service is rendered with
  ``group_add: ["<gid>"]``.

Both halves are needed, and this is the part that is easy to get wrong: setgid
makes **new files inherit the directory's group**. It does *not* make any
container process a member of that group. Without ``group_add`` the container
is not in the group at all, and the group-write bit grants it nothing. The
framework's own entrypoint adds a third half for the process that actually
serves requests: it joins the ``osprey`` user to the mounted directory's group
before dropping privileges, because ``group_add`` reaches only the container's
initial process. The logbook mirror written by ``qmd_export`` is shared through
exactly the same mechanism.

One limit follows from how Unix works rather than from OSPREY: setgid fixes who
*owns* a new file, not its permission bits, which come from the writing
process's umask --- normally ``rw-r--r--``. So the supported cross-container
operation is **read and index**, not overwrite. See
:ref:`One bundle, many terminals <shared-bundle-multi-user>` for the operator's
view of the same mechanism.

Disk footprint
--------------

Measured against a real 134,996-entry ALS logbook:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 60 40

   * - Component
     - Size
   * - Markdown mirror (logical)
     - 41 MB
   * - Markdown mirror (allocated on disk)
     - 553 MB
   * - qmd index
     - 695 MB
   * - **Total per 135,000 entries**
     - **1.25 GB** (~925 MB per 100,000)

The gap between logical and allocated size is the point to budget for: the
mirror is one small file per entry, so it is dominated by filesystem block
overhead rather than by content. Chunking is close to 1:1 for logbook
micro-documents (2,000 documents produced 2,001 chunks), so the index grows with
entry count rather than with entry length.

.. _qmd-where-the-sidecar-listens:

Where the sidecar listens
-------------------------

The sidecar publishes **10060**, its slot in the deployment's port layout
(:ref:`reference-ports`); the block's ``port`` key pins it somewhere else if you
need that. qmd's own daemon runs on **8181** on the container's internal
loopback and is fronted by a small forwarder. That split is
not cosmetic: qmd hardcodes a loopback-only bind with no option to change it,
which makes it unreachable from any other container. Only the forwarder owns a
routable port.

.. warning::

   **The sidecar has no authentication.** No token, no TLS, no per-caller
   identity --- it answers any request that reaches it, over the whole indexed
   corpus. That is safe exactly as long as only this host can reach it.

   This is why ``bind_address`` is **not** a ``services.qmd`` key. Like every
   other service, the sidecar publishes on the project-wide
   ``deployment.bind_address`` (default ``127.0.0.1``), so a deployment cannot
   put an unauthenticated search endpoint on an interface the rest of the stack
   is not already on. Moving that one key off loopback moves this service too.
