Facility Rules
==============

The always-in-context tier of :doc:`Facility Knowledge <index>`
is the set of Markdown rules under the project's ``.claude/rules/`` directory.
They load into the main agent's context at the start of every session, the same
way ``CLAUDE.md`` does. Several of them carry facility-specific operating
context.


What the ``control-assistant`` preset ships
===========================================

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 34 51 15

   * - Rule
     - Holds
     - Facility-specific
   * - ``facility.md``
     - Facility identity (name, type, mission) and a pointer to the on-demand
       knowledge tools.
     - Yes
   * - ``control-system-safety.md``
     - Which control protocol the facility runs (EPICS, Tango, OPC-UA, LabVIEW)
       and the required ``osprey.runtime`` write path.
     - Yes
   * - ``timezone.md``
     - The facility timezone used to interpret timestamps.
     - Yes
   * - ``safety.md``
     - Channel-write safety, tool confinement, and data-integrity rules.
     - Customizable
   * - ``error-handling.md``
     - Error taxonomy and response protocol for tool failures.
     - Customizable
   * - ``artifacts.md``, ``python-execution.md``, ``workflows.md``
     - Generic operating rules — artifact reuse, code execution, and
       task planning/delegation.
     - No

Some rules render conditionally: ``data-visualization.md`` is generated only
when the ``data-visualizer`` agent is *not* enabled (the agent carries its own
plotting guidance, and the ``control-assistant`` preset enables it — so a
default project has no such rule file), and ``timezone.md`` only appears when
``system.timezone`` is set.

A build profile can add rules of its own. Any rule without ``paths`` frontmatter
loads unconditionally at session start.


Test IOC port isolation
=======================

``test-ioc-safety`` is a packaged rule the ``control-assistant`` preset selects
by default (it renders only for EPICS-family control systems). For other
profiles, add it to the ``rules:`` list when the project runs an EPICS soft IOC
for testing:

.. code-block:: yaml

   rules:
     - test-ioc-safety   # mandatory port isolation for a test soft IOC

It renders only for EPICS-family control systems (``control_system.type`` of
``epics`` or ``virtual_accelerator``); selected under any other protocol it
renders empty and the build drops the file.

The rule exists because EPICS Channel Access broadcasts on UDP by default. A
``softIoc`` started with no port configuration binds to UDP 5064 (server) and
5065 (beacon) and beacons to the broadcast address — where every real IOC on the
network sees it. A test PV whose name collides with a production PV can then
route a read to the wrong value, or a write to real hardware. The rule tells the
agent to refuse any test-IOC action that does not satisfy all six of:

#. CAS ports outside the 5064–5076 production range (default ``59064``/``59065``).
#. **Both** ``EPICS_CAS_SERVER_PORT`` and ``EPICS_CAS_BEACON_PORT`` set —
   setting one leaves the other on its default.
#. Every CA client overriding ``EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT``, stated each time the
   agent hands over a test PV.
#. Every test PV carrying the test prefix (default ``OSPREY:TEST:``) — the last
   line of defense if the ports somehow fail to isolate.
#. ``softIoc`` launched only through a startup script that exports the ports
   first, never bare at a shell prompt.
#. DB files within the EPICS parser's limits — DESC fields at most 39 ASCII
   characters, no multibyte characters, and no ``$(...)`` even inside comments.

The rule carries the startup-script pattern, the client-side environment, a
pre-flight validation snippet, and the shutdown sequence, so the agent has a
concrete correct procedure rather than a prohibition alone.


Changing a rule
===============

There are two ways to edit a rule.

**Edit the Markdown directly.** Each rule is a file under ``.claude/rules/``.
``facility.md`` is yours to edit — it is user-owned, and ``osprey build``
never overwrites it. The framework-generated rules *are* re-rendered by
``osprey build``; to keep an edit to one of those, claim it into the profile
first with ``osprey scaffold claim rules/safety`` (:ref:`profile-claim`).

**Through the web terminal.** ``osprey web`` exposes the agent's ``.claude/``
files in the browser: edit a rule in the setup editor, or use the scaffold
gallery to override a framework-generated rule (which claims it for you). See
:doc:`../web-terminal/operate`.

Answer provenance (verify-first)
================================

Beyond the ``.claude/rules/`` files, the agent's *answer posture* is set by two
framework-generated artifacts — the ``control-operator`` output-style and the
generated ``CLAUDE.md``. Both instruct the agent to answer **verify-first**: for
a factual question it queries the appropriate tool or source first and leads with
that result, naming the source; anything it cannot back with a tool is flagged
plainly and up front — never a confident lead with a buried caveat, and never an
answer followed by an optional offer to verify. A multi-tool or research answer
closes with an explicit provenance summary — the sources it used and a brief
confidence/scope note — while single reads stay terse.

Because it ships in framework-generated artifacts, the claimed-artifact caveat
from `Changing a rule`_ applies. A deployment that has ``osprey scaffold
claim``ed ``CLAUDE.md`` (``claude-md``) or the ``control-operator`` output-style
keeps its own copy and will **not** pick up this behavior on the next
``osprey build``. To adopt it, review the framework version and either merge it
by hand or unclaim and rebuild:

.. code-block:: console

   $ osprey scaffold diff output-styles/control-operator     # framework vs. yours
   $ osprey scaffold unclaim output-styles/control-operator  # then: osprey build
