Facility Graph Contracts
==========================

What the facility graph stores, how its names are spelled, and what each of the
four ``graph`` MCP tools returns. For the task of searching it, see
:doc:`/how-to/facility-knowledge/use-facility-graph`.


What the Graph Holds
====================

The corpus is a Turtle (``.ttl``) file in the NARAD convention — facts written
as subject-predicate-object triples — which the neosemantics plugin turns into
the nodes and relationships a query walks. Four kinds of thing matter to a
query:

* **Devices** — one node per physical device, carrying ``sourceName``,
  ``sectionCode``, ``system``, ``sPositionM`` (position along the beamline) and
  ``ordinalInSection``, plus the prose for the three levels the device sits
  under: ``ringDescription``, ``systemDescription`` and ``familyDescription``.
* **Channel bindings** — one node per control system address, carrying
  ``fullPv``, ``protocol``, ``confidence`` and three texts: ``description`` is
  the sentence written for that one channel, while ``fieldDescription`` and
  ``subfieldDescription`` say what the last two tokens of the address mean. A
  device reaches its bindings over ``HASBINDING``.
* **Signals** — what a binding reads or writes, reached over ``READSSIGNAL`` or
  ``WRITESSIGNAL``. Exactly one of the two sits on every binding, so the
  direction of an address is a property of the graph rather than a guess from
  its name.
* **Classes** — the device ontology, linked by ``SUBCLASSOF``. A device is
  typed by ``TYPE``. This is what lets "every magnet" find an ``HCorrector``
  without the query naming ``HCorrector``. Classes also carry the synonyms an
  operator would say out loud, as ``skos:altLabel``.

The descriptions are what makes the graph reachable from a phrase rather than
only from a name: "the magnets that bend the beam" matches text no address
spells. They sit on bindings rather than on signals because an address is
ring-qualified and a signal is not — ``SR:MAG:QF:01:CURRENT:SP`` and its
booster counterpart share one signal node but are described differently.

The descriptions and ``system`` come from the generator, so they are there in a
corpus ``build-ttl`` produced — the demo machine — and not necessarily in one
imported straight from a facility's own export. On such a corpus the way in is
a name, an ``altLabel``, a section or a class.

Three spelling rules come from neosemantics and catch out anyone writing Cypher
from memory:

* Every node carries the label ``Resource`` plus the local name of its RDF
  class — ``(b:ChannelBinding)`` narrows to bindings, ``(c:Class)`` to ontology
  classes.
* Relationship types are **uppercased**: ``HASBINDING``, not ``hasBinding``.
  Property names keep their original spelling. A query naming something that
  does not exist returns zero rows rather than an error, so a guess produces a
  confident wrong answer — which is what ``get_schema`` is for.
* ``altLabel`` is a **list**, not a string: the store keeps every synonym
  instead of letting the last one win. Match it with
  ``ANY(l IN c.altLabel WHERE l = $label)``. Comparing it to a string —
  ``c.altLabel = $label`` — is a list against a text and never matches, and the
  string operators do not apply to it at all.


The Four Tools
==============

The ``graph`` server exposes four tools. Used in this order they cost the
fewest turns:

1. ``example_queries`` — a curated, runnable set covering the common question
   shapes: device counts by class (concrete and rolled up the ontology), every
   device of a class including its subclasses, a section walk in beam order,
   every PV of one device split by direction, the class hierarchy as a table
   and as inheritance chains, a read/write split across all bindings, and
   devices sharing one PV. Each carries its Cypher and a parameter set whose
   values are framework defaults taken from the shipped demo machine. Adapting
   one is reliable where inventing a query is guesswork.
2. ``get_schema`` — the labels, relationship types and per-label property names
   actually present in *this* graph, plus the NARAD namespace prefix map for
   reading and building ``uri`` values. Call it when you need a name the
   examples do not use. Property lists are sampled rather than exhaustive;
   labels and relationship types are complete.
3. ``read_cypher`` — runs one read-only query and returns
   ``columns``/``rows``/``row_count``/``truncated``. Pass values through
   ``params`` as ``$name`` placeholders rather than pasting them into the query
   text; the curated examples are written that way, so an example plus its
   parameter set runs unedited.
4. ``capabilities`` — the static manifest (description, tool list, operating
   notes). It does not dial the store, so a successful reply says nothing about
   whether the graph is up.

In a deployed project the agent rarely needs the first two: whichever verb
seeds or re-verifies the store — the staging step inside every ``osprey up``,
or ``osprey knowledge seed-graph`` — captures the live store's schema (property
lists complete, not sampled) together with the curated examples, and bakes them
into the rendered ``facility-knowledge-graph`` agent prompt, stamped with the
seed marker's checksum. Each example's parameters are marked in the block as
captured from this corpus or as framework defaults, so the agent knows which
values it can trust as real addresses. The block also carries the class
vocabulary — every class's ``altLabel`` synonyms — read from the same store, so
the agent maps an operator's word to a class without a hard-coded list, and
goes straight to ``read_cypher``. Because the writer of the snapshot is the
writer of the store, prompt and graph cannot drift apart silently; a rebuilt
render resets the prompt to a placeholder, and the next ``up`` fills it back
in. The tools stay registered as the recovery path — a query that returns zero
rows for a name the snapshot lists means the store changed out from under it,
and ``get_schema`` is the arbiter.

Results are bounded in two directions. At most
``services.graphdb.query_max_rows`` rows come back — the reply says
``truncated: true`` when more matched — and the store cancels a query that
outlives ``services.graphdb.query_timeout_s``. Both bound one *question*, not
the store. Raising them spends the agent's context window rather than the
store's memory: a few thousand rows crowd out the conversation long before they
trouble Neo4j. The better answer to a truncated result is usually a narrower
query — add a filter, bound the traversal, or aggregate.
