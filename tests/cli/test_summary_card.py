"""The closing summary card, and which verbs print one.

Three things are asserted here and kept apart on purpose: what the card SAYS
(rendered from a repo and a state), that it says it through the CLI's renderer
and therefore under every reporter, and WHICH verb prints one — a detached
start, never an attached one, and exactly one for a whole ``init --up`` chain
rather than one per verb in it.

The card is echo class: it is the verb's own closing output, not decoration on
its progress, so it goes out through :mod:`osprey.cli.output` and survives the
``NullReporter`` that global ``--verbose`` installs. That is a change in what
``osprey -v up`` prints, and it is pinned here rather than left to be noticed.

Card lines are read off a recording console or off the plain-text renderer
directly, never out of ``result.output``: the renderer prints through whichever
console the installed reporter owns, and a CliRunner presents one of its own
width — so an assertion on captured stdout is an assertion about wrapping, and
the card carries a filesystem path, which is exactly what wrapping breaks.
