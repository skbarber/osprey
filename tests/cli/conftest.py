def terminal_probe(

    """Capture what the terminal shows *and* what the loggers emitted.

    The instrument for altitude and promotion claims. The gate the CLI installs
    is a filter on the root ``RichHandler``, so a record it drops still reaches
    every record-level observer — ``caplog``, a record sink, ``debug_probe``.
    Those instruments structurally cannot see a handler gate; this one can,
    because it owns the console the handler paints through.

    Which instrument to reach for:

    * **This fixture** for anything about the *rendered* terminal: a promoted
      fact appearing in the default view, its old log form no longer appearing,
      or a WARNING still getting through. Both halves of that claim come from
      one object, so the "and nothing was lost" half cannot be forgotten.
    * **``debug_probe``** (``tests/cli/test_lifecycle_phases.py``) for anything
      about *emission* alone: whether a demoted call site logs at all under the
      level a flag chose. It emits from inside a running verb and reads the
      level the group callback applied, which is a different link in the chain
      from what the handler paints.
    * **``caplog``** stays fine for ordinary "was this logged, with what
      message" assertions that make no claim about the terminal.

    Console settings, and what they let you assert:

    * ``width=100`` — a fixed width, so wrapping is reproducible across
      machines. Long facts do wrap; assert on a distinctive fragment.
    * ``force_terminal=True`` with the CLI's own theme — the handler paints
      exactly the styled output a real terminal gets, theme style names
      (``[success]``, ``[warning]``…) resolve instead of raising, and
      :attr:`~TerminalProbe.styled_text` exposes the escape sequences. Plain
      assertions stay safe because :attr:`~TerminalProbe.rendered_text` strips
      them back off.

    Interplay with a CLI invocation:

        def test_the_fact_is_in_the_default_view(terminal_probe, monkeypatch):
            # The group callback loads an ancestor .env straight into os.environ.
            monkeypatch.setattr(
                "osprey.utils.config.load_project_dotenv", lambda *a, **k: None
            )
            result = CliRunner().invoke(cli, ["up"])

            assert "deployment is browse-only" in result.output       # printed
            assert "browse-only" not in terminal_probe.rendered_text  # not logged
            assert any("browse-only" in m for m in terminal_probe.messages)

    The CLI points the handler at its own stderr console; the fixture wraps
    ``set_handler_console`` so the probe console wins instead, for the whole
    run rather than only afterwards. That splits the two streams cleanly:
    printed output (echo-class ``report()``/``section()`` lines) lands in
    ``CliRunner``'s ``result.output``, while anything the *logging* path painted
    lands in ``rendered_text``. Invoking the CLI before or after asking for the
    probe both work.

    Note:
        A mounted live region borrows the handler's console and restores it by
        identity (``PhaseReporter._borrow_log_console()``), so records logged
        while a progress display is up are painted by the reporter, not here.
        That is the production behaviour, not a fixture artefact.

    Note:
        The root logger's level is left alone. A DEBUG record under a default
        (INFO) run is therefore absent from ``records`` too — which is the
        truth about that run, and what makes a real demotion detectable.

    Yields:
        The :class:`TerminalProbe` for the test body.
