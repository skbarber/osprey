"""What a build says at INFO, and what it now only says at DEBUG.

``osprey build`` renders the project six times — the deployment, one project per
persona, and a container copy of each. Every render used to re-emit its full
report at INFO, so an operator read the same injector block, the same provider
report and the same config-writer field dumps six times over for one build.

The demotion is the whole mechanism: no new log level, no change to
:func:`~osprey.utils.logger.configure_logging`. INFO stays the default filter,
and the per-render detail moves below it. These tests pin both halves — the
noise is gone from INFO, and it is still *there* at DEBUG, because a build that
cannot be debugged is not quieter, only less honest.
