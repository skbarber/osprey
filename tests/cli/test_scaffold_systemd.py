"""``osprey scaffold systemd`` — the verb, not the unit it renders.

The rendered bytes are pinned elsewhere: ``tests/deployment/
test_scaffold_systemd_unit.py`` holds the template to a golden, directive by
directive. What is tested here is everything around the render — where the file
lands, which repo the verb decides it is acting on, what happens when something
is already at that path, and what an operator is told to do with the file once
it is written.

Three of those are worth naming.

*The host, not the profile.* The unit is rendered from a repo with its
``deploy:`` block commented out, which is what ``osprey init`` emits. A verb
that reached for deployment coordinates it does not need would fail here, and
would fail on every repo that is deployed by hand.

*The two absolute paths.* A unit starts with no working directory and a short
PATH, so both the repo and the ``osprey`` program have to be written into it in
full. The executable is resolved through a helper that reads the machine, so
every test here freezes it: a unit whose contents depend on the developer's
PATH is a unit nobody can pin.

*The instruction.* The unit is written to the repo root and takes effect from
``~/.config/systemd/user/``, so the verb's output is the only thing standing
between "emitted" and "installed".

*The pair.* The verb emits two files with independent histories — the unit, and
the boot hook under ``scripts/`` — and the printing has to keep them apart. A
hand-written hook is a refusal, but it is not a reason to stop telling an
operator how to install the unit they did just get.

    ``findmnt`` does not exist and an unpatched lookup would answer for every
    case at once.

    Autouse, so the seam is closed from setup even for the tests that never
    mention it: ``shutil.which`` answers ``None``, which is the quiet default
    (no binary, no warning, and the answer those tests already expect), and

    ``emit`` would run the real detection against the machine's own ``$HOME``
    — a live ``findmnt`` per test on Linux, with a two-second timeout hanging
    off it. No assertion here depends on the outcome, so nothing was failing;
    what the default removes is the subprocess and the machine-dependence.

    The returned ``install`` is how a test opts into a specific answer, exactly
