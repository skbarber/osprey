"""Tests for the ``_inject_dispatch`` build step in ``osprey.cli.build_cmd``.

Covers the four responsibilities of the dispatch-injection step: resolving and
copying the triggers file (bundled preset name or profile-relative path),
copying the bundled event_dispatcher + dispatch_worker compose templates,
writing the ``services.*`` config + registering both in ``deployed_services``
(additively), and raising on an unresolvable triggers name.
