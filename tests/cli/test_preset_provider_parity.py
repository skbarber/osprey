"""Guard: shipped config templates expose the same LLM providers, and every
provider they declare is actually routable by the Claude Code harness.

Regression for the ds4 gap (2026-06): the ``ds4`` (local DeepSeek V4) provider
was added to the model registry and the *generic* ``project/config.yml.j2`` but
not to the per-app preset configs. Building ``--preset control-assistant
--set provider=ds4`` therefore produced ``claude_code.provider: ds4`` with no
matching ``api.providers.ds4`` stanza, and the resolver raised
``Unknown Claude Code provider 'ds4'`` — every agentic call died at fixture
setup. The root cause is structural: the ``api.providers`` block is duplicated
across templates instead of inherited from one framework default, so "add a
provider" silently means "edit N files" and one got missed.

These tests encode the invariant that prevents the next provider from drifting:
the full-featured presets carry an identical provider set, and each provider in
any shipped template resolves through ``ClaudeCodeModelResolver`` (no
half-wired provider that builds but can't route).
