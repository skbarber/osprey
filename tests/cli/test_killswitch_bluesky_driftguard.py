"""Drift guard: the rendered settings.json kill-switch stays in sync with
FRAMEWORK_SERVERS' write-gated tools.

Task 1.11 generalized the kill-switch's writes-off deny/remove_ask block in
``build_claude_code_context`` to walk ``FRAMEWORK_SERVERS`` for any
``hooks_pre`` rule gated by ``_WRITES_CHECK``, so a new write server (e.g. the
bluesky queue's arming tools) is covered automatically with no per-server code
change. ``test_killswitch_bluesky_deny.py`` pins that behavior at the
``build_claude_code_context`` context-dict level.

This module is the drift guard proper: it exercises the FULL render pipeline
(``TemplateManager.create_project`` + ``regenerate_claude_code`` ->
``settings.json.j2``) and reads the actual on-disk ``.claude/settings.json``,
and it computes the expected write-gated tool set *dynamically* from
``FRAMEWORK_SERVERS`` rather than hardcoding tool names. So it catches both
kinds of drift: a future change that decouples the template from
``facility_permissions.deny``/``remove_ask``, and a new
``_WRITES_CHECK``-gated tool added to ``FRAMEWORK_SERVERS`` with no matching
kill-switch coverage — including the bluesky queue's arming tools
specifically, but not limited to them.
