"""The lifecycle success criteria, as checks that run instead of checks that are read.

SC-5, SC-7 and SC-8 were written as grep criteria over ``src/``. A grep in a
plan document is a thing somebody remembers to run once. The same grep as a
test is a thing the next change has to get past, which is the only form in
which "zero occurrences" survives contact with a codebase that keeps moving.
That is what this module is: the source-tree-wide criteria, scripted.

It deliberately does NOT re-test behavior. Every per-command contract already
has its own suite — ``test_repo_resolver`` for the walk, ``test_discovery_rewire``
for the rewired verbs, ``test_init_verb`` and ``test_emitted_artifacts_clean``
for what a fresh deployment ships. Those check that the right thing happens.
This checks that the wrong thing is nowhere left to be found, which is a
different question and needs a different instrument: a sweep over the source
tree rather than an invocation of any part of it.

Three habits keep a sweep like this honest.

**Word-exact, and proven word-exact.** ``OSPREY_PROJECT`` is retired;
``OSPREY_PROJECT_DIR``, ``OSPREY_PROJECT_NAME`` and ``OSPREY_PROJECT_LABEL``
are load-bearing. A substring grep condemns all three, so the criterion is a
word match — and the test that asserts the retired name is absent also asserts
the three compounds are PRESENT. A word-boundary bug that silently matched
nothing would otherwise read as a pass.

**Every exemption is named, with its reason.** An allowlist entry says which
file, which string, and why that occurrence has to stay. An allowlist that
grew by accident is a criterion that has quietly stopped meaning anything, so
each entry carries the argument for its own existence and the test fails if an
entry stops matching — a stale exemption is as much a defect as a new
violation.

**Structure, not enumeration.** The resolver criterion does not list the
commands that must use the resolver. It asks the CLI for its own command list
and requires every entry to either reach the resolver or appear in the
resolver's own exemption sets. A command added tomorrow is covered the day it
is registered, which a hand-written list would not be.
