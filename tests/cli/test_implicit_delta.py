"""A ``personas/<name>.yml`` file resolves as a delta over the profile it lives under.

Living in ``personas/`` beside a ``profile.yml`` IS the inheritance (FR-10): the
file carries only what makes it that persona, and the build merges it over the
host profile rather than reading it standalone. Nothing in the file says so —
the classification is made from its location — so the resolver is the only place
that knows, and everything downstream depends on it getting the merge and the
ANCHOR right.

The anchor is the half that is easy to get wrong. Every profile-relative path —
``data:``, the convention directories, ``.env``, the hash material — resolves
against the profile ROOT, never the delta's own parent. That is what makes one
facility data tree serve the whole stack.

``exclude:`` is the delta's subtractive half, and its SPELLING is the contract.
A bare entry (``channel-finder``) unselects a built-in library artifact; a
qualified one (``agents/channel-finder``) omits the profile's own file of that
name. The two namespaces are disjoint — ``validate_artifacts`` rejects any
top-level ``agents:`` entry the built-in library does not carry — so conflating
them would make excluding a shadow delete the built-in version along with it,
when the point of excluding a shadow is to get the built-in version BACK.
