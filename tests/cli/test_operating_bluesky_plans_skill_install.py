"""Tests for the operating-bluesky-plans skill and its 4-point framework wiring.

Mirrors ``test_writing_bluesky_plans_skill_install.py``'s registry/template/
preset/manifest wiring pattern, plus a real ``TemplateManager.create_project``
build (the standard skill-install path for the
``templates/claude_code/claude/skills/`` family) to verify the skill actually
lands on disk end to end.

The content assertions pin the draft-first run surface: the skill choreographs
``set_draft`` -> human review -> ``queue_add(draft_revision)`` ->
``queue_start`` -> watch, and must never name the deleted/renamed tools
(``create_run_*``, ``run_status``, ``read_run_data``, ``*_plan_draft``,
``launch_run``).

Two assertions here are safety pins rather than documentation checks, and
both fail in the direction that matters:

* ``test_no_stale_tool_names`` includes ``launch_run``. Neither that tool nor
  its route exists; prose naming it would send the agent at a dead surface.
* ``TestOperatingBlueskyPlansStopHonesty`` pins that the skill tells the truth
  about halting — that a plain ``queue_stop`` halts the queue only after the
  running item finishes, that ``stop_run`` aborts the plan already in motion,
  what that abort costs, and that a failed abort is never reported as a halt.
  Its last test is the inverse pin: wording that denies any abort ("no OSPREY
  surface does", "out-of-band") must not sit next to the tool that performs
  one, because that combination tells an agent not to reach for a working halt.
