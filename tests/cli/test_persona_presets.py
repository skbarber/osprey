"""Tests for the control-assistant multi-user persona presets.

The ``control-assistant`` preset hosts its own multi-user web tier — nginx,
the landing page, and one terminal container per roster user — alongside the
full plan stack. Two persona presets extend it to carve out capability tiers
that differ on exactly three axes — enforcement
(``control_system.writes_enabled``), surface (``web.ui_mode``), and the
write-oriented panel declarations (EVENTS + BLUESKY, readwrite-only):

* ``control-assistant-readwrite`` — write-capable tier; expert workspace;
  channel writes pass the ordinary safety chain (writes-check, limits, human
  approval); declares the EVENTS/BLUESKY panels.
* ``control-assistant-readonly`` — read-only tier; simple chat-first surface;
  every write surface refuses; built without the EVENTS/BLUESKY panels.

The base's own ``web_terminals`` roster block is also exercised here. Shared
render helpers live at the top so new sections append without restructuring.
