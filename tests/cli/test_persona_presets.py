"""Tests for the control-assistant multi-user persona presets.

The ``control-assistant`` preset hosts its own multi-user web tier — nginx,
the landing page, and one terminal container per roster user — alongside the
full plan stack. Five persona presets extend it. Four of them are capability
TIERS over the same deployment, and one is a standalone service that happens to
live on the same landing page:

* ``control-assistant-readonly`` — read-only tier; simple chat-first surface;
  every write surface refuses on every target; built without the EVENTS/BLUESKY
  panels.
* ``control-assistant-va-readwrite`` — the rung between the two: armed on the
  virtual accelerator and read-only on the live machine, because write posture
  is per connector type. Not on the shipped roster — a facility points a
  persona at it — so the tier-contract comparisons below stay a statement about
  the three tiers the stack actually builds, and the posture claim is pinned in
  its own section instead.
* ``control-assistant-readwrite`` — write-capable tier; expert workspace;
  channel writes pass the ordinary safety chain (writes-check, limits, human
  approval); declares the EVENTS/BLUESKY panels.
* ``control-assistant-admin`` — deployment-editing tier; readwrite's write
  posture over the MACHINE (``writes_enabled``, ``ui_mode``) but NOT its
  operator panels, plus the privileges the base floors off: the
  ``setup_patch`` tool, the web Config panel, the scaffold gallery's editors,
  and the ``setup-mode`` skill that drives them.
* ``control-assistant-ariel`` — not a tier: the standalone logbook-research
  deployment, filed under its own landing-page heading.

The tier contract therefore has two halves, and both are asserted wholesale
below rather than key-by-key. The MACHINE axes separate readonly from
readwrite: enforcement (``control_system.writes_enabled``), surface
(``web.ui_mode``), and the write-oriented panel declarations (EVENTS +
BLUESKY, readwrite-only). The DEPLOYMENT axes separate admin from both:
``claude_code.permissions.remove_deny`` for the ``setup_patch`` tool,
``web.config_panel.enabled``, ``web.scaffold_gallery.write_enabled``, and the
``setup-mode`` skill. The base pins the restricted side of every deployment
axis, so a new persona inherits the floor and has to ask for a privilege by
name.

The base's own ``web_terminals`` roster block is also exercised here. Shared
render helpers live at the top so new sections append without restructuring.

#:
#: The matrix rather than the keys, because the keys are not the answer: write
#: posture is per connector type, a target names a machine, and what an
#: operator holds is whatever ``target_writes_enabled`` returns for the target
#: their session is on. A preset can reach ``False`` three different ways —
#: a flat key that is not literally ``True``, a per-type block pinned off, or a
#: target that resolves to no type at all — and a table of keys would not tell
#: them apart. Stated literally and never derived from the resolver: a table
#: computed from the code under test would pin nothing.
#:
#: Every shipped preset appears, so a new one has to state its posture here
#: before it ships rather than inheriting a silent one.
#:
#: All three targets in :data:`CONTROL_TARGETS`, ``standin`` included, even
#: though no preset writes a ``control_system.connector.live_standin`` block:
#: the block is DERIVED by the build from ``virtual_accelerator.live_standin``,
#: and this matrix renders the ``config:`` layer alone. That is the point of
#: the column rather than a gap in it — it pins that no preset arms the
#: stand-in by name, so the hardware-shaped third machine holds whatever the
#: tier's deployment-wide key holds and never a posture of its own.
