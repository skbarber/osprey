"""The lifecycle verbs' wiring to the phase reporter.

What is asserted here is the wiring, not the rendering: which reporter each verb
installs, that a chained verb reports into the outer verb's reporter instead of
installing a second one, and the phase titles each verb opens in order. The line
shapes themselves belong to ``test_phase_reporter.py``.

Phase lines are read off a recording reporter rather than out of ``result.output``
on purpose. Reporter output goes through the Rich console singleton, which wraps
to the terminal width a CliRunner happens to present, so an assertion on captured
stdout is an assertion about wrapping.
