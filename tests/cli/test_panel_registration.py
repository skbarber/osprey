"""The BLUESKY panel's registration in a built project.

``_inject_bluesky_web`` writes the ``web.panels.bluesky`` entry into a built
``config.yml``, pointing the web-terminal proxy at the sidecar and selecting
the panel's static mount via ``path``. This module covers that registration
end to end: the entry a fresh build writes, the profile validation that lets
``bluesky`` stay url-less (its URL is derived post-build from the sidecar
port), and that the registered path actually serves the panel's HTML.

The rest of ``_inject_bluesky_web`` (template copy, service config,
deployed_services, url derivation, override precedence) is covered by
``test_inject_bluesky_web.py``.
