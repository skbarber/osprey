"""The ``hooks/`` profile convention channel.

Hooks are the one artifact class that is neither markdown nor a directory: they
are executable scripts whose *filename* is the name ``settings.json`` wires. The
tests below prove that giving them a channel buys the same uniform behavior
every other channel has — claim into the profile, shadow the framework render,
own the result, restore it by excluding it — using REAL framework hook names, so
a rename in the artifact catalog fails here rather than passing against a
synthetic fixture.
