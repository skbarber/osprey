"""The ``virtual_accelerator`` control-system type, at the config writer.

``set_control_system_type`` is the config-side writer for the type. The live
CLI path writes through the profile instead (``osprey set connector=…`` +
``osprey build``), so this writer is currently exercised only by tests — it is
retained as the config-side write path. The CLI surface is pinned where those
verbs live: ``osprey set connector=virtual_accelerator`` in
tests/cli/test_set_verb.py, and the shorthand's validation in
tests/cli/test_connector_shorthand.py.
