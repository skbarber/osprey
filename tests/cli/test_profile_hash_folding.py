"""The profile hash covers every file the build reads, and personas resolve their root.

``compute_profile_hash`` is what the deploy-side staleness advisory compares
against, so anything a build consumes has to be inside it. Beyond the ``data:``
tree and ``overlay:`` sources pinned in ``test_profile_material_hash.py``, that
means the profile's convention directories (``rules/``, ``skills/`` and the rest
of the mapping table, including the ``project/`` verbatim mirror) and its
``triggers.yml`` — a rule the agent reads or a trigger a dispatcher fires on is
as much build input as a channel database.

Personas are the second half. A ``personas/<name>.yml`` file holds only a delta,
so its hash is meaningless without the root it merges over: the hash resolves the
same implicit merge the build does, anchored at the profile root, which is what
makes an edit to the root — its YAML, its data tree, or its convention
directories — mark every persona's project stale too.

That relationship runs both ways: the deltas in ``personas/`` are folded into
the ROOT profile's hash as well, so editing one is drift for the deployment
that hosts those personas. It has to be, because a persona's rendered project
is re-rendered only when it is absent — a build wiping ``build/`` is what
re-arms it, and nothing would call for that build if the delta were outside the
fingerprint.
