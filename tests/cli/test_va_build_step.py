"""End-to-end wiring of the build's virtual-accelerator manifest step.

``tests/va/test_build_time_manifest.py`` covers the generator itself; this
module covers the things only a real ``osprey build`` can show: that the
generated files land in the directory the container's bind mount actually
resolves to, that the ``.env`` keys pointing at them appear (and stay away)
together with the files, and that neither of those two facts can drift from the
other without a test failing.

The whole chain is one property, and it has three links: the manifest is
written into ``build/data/simulation/``, the VA compose service mounts THAT
directory at ``/data/simulation``, and the repo-root ``.env`` — the only file
``--env-file`` gives compose — carries the ``VA_CHANNELS_FILE`` pointer at it.
Break any one and the container either serves the framework's bundled channel
namespace while the operator believes they are driving their own facility's, or
refuses to boot: the entrypoint's manifest load raises on an absent file.
