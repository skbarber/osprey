"""Tests for the unified services/ ownership regime.

Service compose templates under ``<project>/services/`` are catalog-managed
directory artifacts, refreshed from the framework by every build unless the
project owns them. Ownership is recorded as ``services/<name>`` in config.yml's
``scaffold.user_owned``, exactly like the Claude Code artifacts — but the build
derives it, by scanning what the profile's ``services/`` convention directory
copied in. ``osprey scaffold claim services/<name>`` is how a service gets
there: it moves the directory out of the project and into the profile.
