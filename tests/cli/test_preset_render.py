"""Tests for the ``control-assistant`` preset's live stand-in default.

The preset's ``control_system.type`` defaults to ``live_standin``: it declares
``virtual_accelerator.live_standin``, so a second copy of the simulator ships
and is deployed as the deployment's own third control target, and the baseline
a fresh project starts on is that hardware-shaped soft IOC — approval prompts,
strict-limit refusals and the LIVE MACHINE (stand-in) banner, on something that
cannot move a magnet. ``virtual_accelerator`` remains the sandbox simulator
beside it, reachable via ``osprey set connector=virtual_accelerator``, and
``mock`` is the documented fallback for environments with no containers to
depend on — its non-tracking readbacks make plans browse-only — reachable via
``osprey set connector=mock``.

The module also pins the preset's TIER FLOOR: the privileges the base preset
takes away from every tier built on it (the ``setup_patch`` deployment-editing
tool, the web Config panel, and writes to the scaffold gallery), which a single
tier lifts back rather than each tier having to remember to restrict itself.

Covers six angles:

1. In-process profile resolution: the base preset and its two extends
   children (``control-assistant-readonly``, ``control-assistant-readwrite``)
   all carry the ``live_standin`` override (fast, no build).
2. A full ``osprey build`` of the bare preset: the rendered ``config.yml``
   carries ``control_system.type: live_standin``.
3. The same rendered build's ``deployed_services`` list is unchanged by the
   flip — it is driven by the ``bluesky:``/``virtual_accelerator:``/
   ``bluesky_web:`` injector blocks, not by ``control_system.type``.
4. The tier floor, in-process on the base and on the three persona deltas that
   stay at it (``readonly``, ``readwrite``, ``ariel``), and on the real render — where
   :func:`~osprey.cli.profile_conventions.is_setup_patch_capable` of the
   rendered ``config.yml`` is now ``False``. That real-render assertion is the
   one deferred when the predicate itself was introduced: until the preset
   carried the deny there was no shipped render to read it from.
5. ``seeded_logins`` on the init'd repo: the preset's ``env.defaults`` seed
   carol's demo password alongside alice's and bob's, so the admin tier's login
   is announced on the landing page the same way the other two are.
6. The ADMIN tier — ``control-assistant-admin``, the one preset that lifts the
   floor back: in-process (what it overrides, and that it is the only tier
   :func:`~osprey.cli.build_cmd._profile_setup_patch_capable` calls capable),
   on the base preset's roster and catalog, and on the real render, where the
   admin ``.claude/settings.json`` ships the setup tool in ``ask`` rather than
   ``deny`` with the approval hook still matching it — and where both rendered
   documents, the composed ``settings.json`` and the ``config.yml`` that
   carries the deny and the ``remove_deny`` together, read as capable.
