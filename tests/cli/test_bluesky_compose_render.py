"""Render-level tests for the bluesky service's compose template.

The queue backend is a four-container arrangement (bridge, RE Manager, Redis,
optionally Tiled) whose safety properties live entirely in how they are wired:
Redis reachable only from an internal network, no published port on either new
service, CurveZMQ keys on both 0MQ planes, and the limits DB present wherever
the reference monitor runs. None of that can be asserted by reading Python —
it is a property of the *rendered* compose file, so these tests render the
packaged template with production-shaped contexts and assert against the
parsed YAML.

Rendering the packaged template (not a built project's copy) is deliberate
here: this is the artifact `_inject_bluesky` copies, so it is the one whose
contract the rest of the feature depends on.

# dependency pins, so a strict `pip check` there fails EVERY `--dev` build for
# as long as any pin has moved since the last release. The wheel layer, which
# installs the local wheel the local pins actually belong to, is where the
# check means something on that path — so it stays unconditional. These pins
# exist because that asymmetry is invisible in a green unit-test run and only
# shows up as a failed image build.
#
# For reference: the sibling bluesky_web Dockerfile has NEVER had a
# deps-layer `pip check` — wheel-layer-only is the house shape, and this
# template is the one that diverged from it.
