"""Render-level tests for the bluesky service's compose template.

The queue backend is a four-container arrangement (bridge, RE Manager, Redis,
optionally Tiled) whose safety properties live entirely in how they are wired:
Redis reachable only from an internal network, no published port on either new
service, CurveZMQ keys on both 0MQ planes, and the limits DB present wherever
the reference monitor runs. None of that can be asserted by reading Python —
it is a property of the *rendered* compose file, so these tests render the
packaged template with production-shaped contexts and assert against the
parsed YAML.

Rendering the packaged template (not a built project's copy) is deliberate
here: this is the artifact `_inject_bluesky` copies, so it is the one whose
contract the rest of the feature depends on.
