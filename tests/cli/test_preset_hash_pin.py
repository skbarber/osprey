"""Pin: the YAML-surface rename must not move any bundled preset's hash.

``preset_hash`` is stamped into ``.osprey-manifest.json`` at build time and
compared by the deploy-side staleness advisory, so a hash that moves for a
purely cosmetic key rename would report drift on every already-deployed
project. The digests below were recorded from the bundled presets *before* the
``data_bundle`` → ``app_template`` YAML rename; they are the durable evidence
that the rename stayed hash-neutral, and they are deliberately hardcoded rather
than recomputed — a test that derives its expectation from the code under test
would pin nothing.

Any change to these values means a preset's *resolved content* changed. That is
a legitimate thing to do, but it is a deploy-visible event: update the digest
here in the same commit, knowingly.
