"""The profile content hash covers the files a profile points at, not just its YAML.

``compute_profile_hash`` is what the deploy-side staleness advisory compares
against, so anything a build consumes has to be inside it. A profile's ``data:``
tree is consumed verbatim by the build, which means a facility that edits a
channel database changes what a project would be built from while the profile
YAML itself is untouched — invisible to a hash over the YAML alone.

The convention directories and ``triggers.yml`` are folded on the same
principle; they are pinned separately in ``test_profile_hash_folding.py``.

The digest is pinned to a deterministic shape: every regular file contributes its
posix path relative to the source plus the SHA-256 of its bytes, entries sorted by
that path, directories skipped. Sorting removes filesystem walk order and posix
separators remove the platform, so two identical trees hash identically no matter
where or on what they live.
