"""Tests for the container entrypoint that ships into every render.

``osprey build`` emits ``entrypoint.sh`` beside the Dockerfile, inside the
render, and the image installs it as the container's ENTRYPOINT. It runs as
root and does three things in one fixed order — drift-regen, scaffold restore,
then ``gosu`` down to the unprivileged ``osprey`` user — because every one of
them is a write into a render that this image makes root-owned, and the process
that serves requests must not hold the privilege to repeat them.

The order is the security property, so it is asserted twice: once on the text
of the shipped script, and once by actually running it against stub ``python``,
``gosu`` and ``id`` executables that record what was invoked and when. The
stubs make the run hermetic — no container, no docker, no real interpreter —
while still exercising the branch logic (root vs. not, gosu present vs. not,
maintenance succeeding vs. failing) that a textual assertion cannot reach.
