"""Tests for the terminal live region (``LiveReporter``).

The region is decoration over the plain lines, and every test here is about
that relationship rather than about how the region looks (which
``test_live_render.py`` owns): the same words still reach the scrollback, the
region never outlives the moment it is torn down, and nothing it does can
appear after a failure line.

Everything runs on a recording console with ``force_terminal=True``, because a
Rich ``Live`` on a non-terminal console silently renders nothing -- a test suite
that forgot this would assert against a region that was never drawn.
