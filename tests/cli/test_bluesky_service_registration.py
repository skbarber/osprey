"""Tests for the ``_inject_bluesky`` build step in ``osprey.cli.build_cmd``.

Covers the responsibilities of the bluesky-injection step: copying the bundled
bluesky compose template, writing the ``services.bluesky`` config +
registering it in ``deployed_services`` (additively) so
``find_service_config`` resolves it, and confirming the feature stays
opt-in — a profile with no ``bluesky:`` key injects nothing.
