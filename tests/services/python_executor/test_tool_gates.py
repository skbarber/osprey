"""Tool-layer pins for the static path policy on ``execute`` / ``execute_file``.

The unit suite (``test_path_policy.py``) pins what the walker *sees*. This one
pins that both MCP tools actually consult it, that they do so in **every**
execution mode rather than under the readonly branch, and that a refusal leaves
the same audit record the other pre-execution layers leave — only with
``reason: "path_policy"``, on the unified ledger's ``executor`` surface.

The refusals here all fire before the subprocess is launched, so nothing is
mocked for them: reaching an assertion at all proves the gate ran ahead of
execution.
