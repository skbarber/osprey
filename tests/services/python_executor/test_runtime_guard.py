"""Tests for the runtime filesystem guard the execution wrapper emits.

The guard exists because the pre-execution walker only sees *literal* paths in
*standard* spellings. ``open(Path('bui' + 'ld') / 'config.yml', 'w')`` gets past
it; the emitted guard does not care how the path was spelled, because it runs in
the child and inspects the resolved path at the moment of the call.

Two properties are load-bearing and are asserted separately here:

* **Unconditional.** The guard is installed in ``readwrite`` runs exactly as in
  ``readonly`` ones. Approving a run to move a magnet is not approving it to
  rewrite the profile that decides what the *next* run may do, so the mode
  changes the refusal's wording and nothing else.
* **Auditable in readonly.** The readonly wording carries
  :data:`READONLY_REFUSAL_MARKER`, which is the only thing
  ``report_runtime_refusal`` scans the child's stderr for. Lose the marker and
  the refusal still holds but silently stops reaching the operator alert and the
  audit ledger.

Behavioural tests run the emitted source in a **real subprocess**, like the
sibling ``test_fs_guard.py`` suite: the guard is source code whose whole point is
what it does to a live interpreter's ``builtins.open``, and running it in-process
would leak patched entry points into every test after it. Two tests run the
*whole* generated wrapper, which is the only way to prove that the wrapper's own
metadata, results and figure writes still land with the guard installed.

Fixture-isolation note: every root is ``resolve()``d, because the guard resolves
the candidate path before comparing — on macOS an unresolved ``/var/...`` root
would never match a resolved ``/private/var/...`` candidate.
