"""Tests for the auth sidecar's ``auth_request`` target.

The endpoint answers one question — may this browser reach ``/u/<user>/`` right
now — and everything pinned here is about it answering "no" often enough. The
acceptance case is the isolation the whole feature exists for: one browser's
valid cookie for alice authorizes alice and *only* alice, on the same request
otherwise unchanged.

Cookies are minted here with a client-side
:class:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.sessions.SessionCodec` rather than by
driving the (not yet landed) login route, so these tests exercise the verify
path alone. The app is always built from an explicit env mapping, so a variable
left in the real process environment cannot make one pass.
