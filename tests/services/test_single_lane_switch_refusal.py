"""The single-lane switch refusal: OC-1, the contract that makes the plan
stack safe to ship before a second lane exists.

Every deployment today renders exactly ONE Bluesky plan lane, wired at build
time to one control target. An agent session, meanwhile, can be switched to the
other target at run time. While the two disagree, a PLAN queued or started here
would run against a machine the session is not pointed at — so ``queue_add`` and
``queue_start`` refuse for as long as they disagree, and ``queue_stop`` never
does, because halting must stay reachable in every posture.

Three things are pinned, and each is pinned at the layer that owns it:

1. **Where the check runs.** The refusal is host-side, in the bluesky MCP
   tools, and lands BEFORE any HTTP call — asserted by the transport mock never
   being called, not merely by a status code. The bridge cannot make this call:
   it serves its lane's target and never learns the session's.
2. **Which way it fails.** Only a *readable* state file naming a *different*
   target refuses. Absent, corrupt, and dead-owner state all read as "on the
   baseline" and permit the operation — no switch has happened, so the lane's
   target is the session's target, and any other direction would break every
   deployment that never switches (today, all of them).
3. **That the reason code is one vocabulary.** The MCP tool module cannot
   import ``queue_backend`` (it pulls in ``bluesky-queueserver-api``), so the
   code string is spelled in both layers; these tests pin them equal, and pin
   the JS queue client's exhaustive capability set as carrying it too. A code
   one consumer has never seen is as useless to it as no code at all.
