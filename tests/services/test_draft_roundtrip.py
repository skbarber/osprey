"""Cross-service integration roundtrip locking the agent-plan-draft contract:
PATCH draft -> SSE frame -> a pinned revision that only the queue will take.

Here, the real ``osprey.interfaces.bluesky_web.app`` sidecar is wired to the
real ``osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.app`` bridge via ``httpx.ASGITransport``
(no real bridge process, no container) -- so a PATCH sent through the sidecar's
``/draft`` relay actually lands on the bridge's draft singleton, and the SSE
frame it broadcasts is observed on the bridge itself. That cross-service hop is
this module's whole subject.

Launching is not part of that chain: plans execute in the queue server, so
``POST /draft/run`` launches nothing and answers the machine-readable
``use_the_queue`` refusal instead. This module asserts exactly that -- a caller
who follows the PATCH with a launch call learns where the capability lives. It
deliberately stops there. The draft-revision-to-enqueue
path (reservation, arming, what reaches the manager) is
``tests/integration/test_bluesky_queue_contract.py``'s subject, against a
stateful mock queue server; duplicating it here would mean two places to update
and one of them silently going stale.

Everything else is covered per-router elsewhere:

- ``tests/interfaces/bluesky_web/test_draft_relay.py`` covers the sidecar's
  routers in isolation (mocked bridge).
- ``tests/services/bluesky_bridge/test_draft.py`` covers the bridge draft
  module's SSE wire format and per-field validation directly.
- ``tests/services/bluesky_bridge/test_run_routes.py`` covers every retired
  route's refusal against the bridge directly.

SSE observation note: ``TestClient``/``httpx.ASGITransport`` cannot stream an
infinite ``text/event-stream`` response (both drain the response body to
completion before returning it), so this test does not connect to
``GET /draft/events`` over HTTP at all. Instead it uses the bridge draft
module's own white-box subscription hook (``draft._subscribe()``), exactly as
``tests/services/bluesky_bridge/test_draft.py`` does for its deterministic
frame assertions. Subscribing directly against the bridge module is legitimate
here specifically because the sidecar and the bridge are the same importable
Python objects in this test process (connected by ``ASGITransport`` rather
than a real socket) -- the SSE wire format itself is already locked by
``test_draft.py``; this test's job is only the cross-service chain around it.

The subscribe-then-patch sequencing below never has the bridge's asyncio
``_lock``/subscriber ``Queue`` contended from two event loops at once (the
synchronous sidecar ``TestClient`` call fully completes on its own portal
loop before this test's own coroutine resumes) -- the same non-concurrent
cross-loop pattern already relied on by
``test_draft.py::test_subscribe_hello_is_atomic_with_current_state``.
