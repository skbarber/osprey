"""Unit tests for `plans_core/orbit_bump_sweep.py`'s `render()`.

What is load-bearing about an `orbit_bump_sweep` figure, and gets pinned here:

- it says whether the bump was a *bump* -- displaced at the targets, back on
  the reference orbit at the closure BPMs -- and whether every step stayed
  inside the tolerance band it asked for;
- it attributes rows by position (``baseline_reads`` baseline rows, then one
  row per scale of the amplitude profile), so a short row set draws the prefix
  it has and says how much of the profile is missing rather than mislabelling
  what it drew;
- a `best_effort` run's misses are named -- which step, which BPM, reached
  against requested -- because that is the whole reason the run continued;
- it never raises, whatever it is handed, because a figure is a view and the
  run's own result does not depend on it;
- every series that reaches the wire is capped and decimated, the flat band
  lines included: they are as long as the sweep and would blow the point
  budget on their own.

Rows are hand-built to the shape `build_plan` emits -- ``baseline_reads``
baseline rows, then exactly one row per amplitude step in profile order, every
row carrying every corrector, BPM, and monitor the parameters name.
