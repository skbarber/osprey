"""Bluesky-marked coverage for the shipped plans' parameter schemas and for
the `orm` and `orbit_bump_sweep` plans' abort-safe restore behavior.

There is no hand-built plan set: a single registry owns them (see
`plan_loader.get_facility_plans`), and `orm`/`grid_scan` are
plain `plans_core/` files, discovered through the layered directory loader.
Their end-to-end registration + RunEngine round trip (through the real
loader, against mock devices) is `test_exemplar_plans.py`'s job — this file
covers what that one doesn't: each plan's own `PARAMS` schema in isolation,
the channel roles each plan declares, the run metadata each one carries
(`grid_scan` inherits the stock plan's, `orm` and `orbit_bump_sweep` stamp
their own), and (task 2.3, CC-1) the `orm` and `orbit_bump_sweep` plans'
restore-in-`finally` abort safety, which only their own generator bodies can
exercise.

The bluesky stack is a core dependency, so these run in the normal unit lane;
the `pytest.importorskip` guard only skips them in a slimmed install where
bluesky is absent. To run this file in an isolated venv:
