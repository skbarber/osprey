"""Guards `app.py`'s `_BRIDGE_ONLY_MODULES` invariant (FR8): importing
`osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.app` must never pull in `bluesky`,
`bluesky_tiled_plugins`, `ophyd`, `ophyd_async`, or `tiled`. The bluesky stack
is a core dependency, so this is
an import-hygiene boundary, not an install-size one. The bridge runs no plans
— the queueserver worker does — so nothing in this process has any business
importing the RunEngine stack, and the Channel Access client libraries have no
business here either: every device lives in the worker.

This MUST run in a fresh subprocess. The dev venv has all four packages
installed, and other tests in this suite legitimately import them, so by
the time an in-process test runs, `sys.modules` is already contaminated —
an in-process assertion would pass or fail depending on test order, not on
what `app.py` actually imports. Only a fresh interpreter, spawned before
anything else has touched `sys.modules`, can answer the question.
