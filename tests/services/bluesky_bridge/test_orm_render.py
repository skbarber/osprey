"""Unit tests for `plans_core/orm.py`'s `render()`.

What is actually load-bearing about an `orm` figure, and gets pinned here:

- it draws sweeps `build_response_matrix` cannot fit at all -- a
  `monodirectional` run renders a full matrix where the legacy path raises;
- it is honest mid-run: completed sweeps are fitted, the in-flight one is
  traced and says so, and correctors the sweep has not reached are absent
  rather than drawn as dead;
- it never raises, whatever it is handed, because a figure is a view and the
  run's own result does not depend on it;
- a row set the run outgrew (the live buffer's per-run cap) keeps its traces
  but loses the peer-comparison panels, which over an arbitrary subset of the
  machine would describe the cap rather than the machine.

Rows are hand-built to the shape `build_plan` emits -- one row per (corrector,
current) point, corrector-major, every row carrying every corrector's current.
