"""Guards the bluesky-free boundary of the plan-metadata extraction chain.

``plan_metadata.py`` parses a plan module's ``PLAN_METADATA`` block out of
source with `ast`, never by importing it, and ``plan_loader.py`` layers plan
files without pulling the RunEngine stack into the reading process. Both
modules document themselves as free of `bluesky`, `ophyd` and `tiled`; these
tests turn that docstring promise into an enforced contract, so any consumer
(the bridge, the CLI's plan-index builder) can import them without dragging in
the run-time stack.

This MUST run in a fresh subprocess. All three packages are installed in the
dev venv and other tests in this suite legitimately import them, so by the time
an in-process test runs `sys.modules` is already contaminated -- an in-process
assertion would pass or fail depending on test order, not on what the module
under test actually imports. Only a fresh interpreter, spawned before anything
else has touched `sys.modules`, can answer the question.
