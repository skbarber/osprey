"""CA-attribute audit for the connector-mediated device layer (task 2.7).

`ConnectorSettable`/`ConnectorReadable` (`devices/connector.py`) hold the live
`ControlSystemConnector` directly on the instance, because the in-process
Bluesky plan body IS handed the device object and must be able to call
`connector.read_channel`/`write_channel_checked` from `set()`/`read()`/
`describe()`. That makes this device object the load-bearing surface for the
"the connector is the sole reachable CA path" claim (CC-2): if a device's
*public* API leaked the raw connector, or an unchecked write method, any plan
author could bypass `write_channel_checked`'s refusal/verification path.

This module enumerates the PUBLIC attribute surface (no leading underscore)
of both device classes and asserts none of it is the connector itself, and
none of it is an unchecked write path. It passes as-is — the public surface
(`read`/`describe`/`set`/`name`/`connect`/`parent`/... — see
`_PUBLIC_ATTRS_ARE_STABLE` below) is already clean. The point of this test is
to LOCK that in as a regression: if a future edit to `connector.py` (or an
ophyd-async version bump that adds a new public `Device`/`StandardReadable`
attribute) exposes the connector or a bare `write_channel`, this test fails.

Known accepted residual (NOT closed by this test, and not closeable by
attribute hiding): the connector reference is stored as
`self._osprey_connector` (connector.py:98, 177) — single-underscore, i.e.
reachable-but-not-public. A plan body holding the device can still reach
`device._osprey_connector.write_channel(...)` (the UNCHECKED write, as
opposed to `write_channel_checked`) via ordinary Python attribute access;
Python has no enforced private attributes, so no naming convention closes
this off, only obfuscates it. The real defense against that path is NOT this
device layer — it's task 2.1's static plan validator (which flags
`write_channel(` and `_osprey_connector` as dangerous patterns before a plan
is ever exec'd), the load-time provenance gate (task 2.4), and human
approval (task 2.6). This test does not claim, and must not be read as
claiming, that the device layer contains an adversarial plan body — see
`connectors/control_system/base.py` (`write_channel` vs
`write_channel_checked`, lines ~270 and ~322) for the deeper audit target of
the unchecked-write surface itself.

Runs ONLY in a bluesky-capable environment, same as `test_connector_devices.py`
(bluesky/ophyd-async are never installed in the main worktree venv):
