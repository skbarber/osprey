"""Coverage for the `session`-tier directory layer and its LOAD-TIME gate
(task 2.4): `plan_loader.py`'s CF-1 core enforcement point.

A `session`-tier plan file (written by task 2.3's `POST /plans/session`,
never itself exec'd by that route) must never be `exec_module`'d, registered,
or discoverable via `get_facility_plans()` unless its *current* on-disk
content hash has a passing record in `validation_record.validation_records`.
This is proven directly — not just "the plan is absent from `facility.plans`"
but "the file's own top-level code never ran at all" — via a sentinel file
write a gated body would perform at import time.

All plan files here are pure pydantic/stdlib (no bluesky import), matching
`test_plan_loader_layered.py`'s bluesky-less lane; the one exception (shipped
exemplar regression) is guarded by `pytest.importorskip`.
