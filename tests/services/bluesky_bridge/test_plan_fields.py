"""Tests for the declared channel contract (`plan_fields`).

The declaring half -- what an author writes -- is pinned on three properties:

1. **Serialization** -- the declared role reaches ``model_json_schema()``, both
   for a top-level field and for a field on a nested model (where it lands
   inside the nested ``$defs`` entry).
2. **Additivity** -- the role only *adds* the ``x-channel-role`` key. Every
   other constraint, title, description and presentation hint an author writes
   on the field survives untouched, which is why the panel's schema-driven form
   generator keeps rendering the same controls it rendered before the role was
   declared.
3. **Introspectability** -- the role is readable from ``model_fields`` as a
   plain dict, the seam the role-walking helpers use.

The reading half -- what consumers do with it -- is pinned on the behaviors
they each depend on: `channel_roles` sees through nesting and stops at a cycle;
`collect_channels` matches the *nearest enclosing* field name and matches it
exactly; `scan_metadata` emits the standard run-metadata keys and is the only
place in the module they are spelled; and `resolve_column` prefers a channel's
own column over the prefixed spelling and answers ``None`` rather than raising.

    What survives, and what this pins, is the property the old rule existed
    for -- the role never drives control dispatch, so adding roles to a
    shipped plan's parameters still renders the same controls. The single
    permitted read is ``channelSuggestionsFor``, which only decides whether a
    field OFFERS suggestions; with no catalog loaded the rendered form is
    byte-identical to the untagged baseline (pinned by the no-catalog case in
    ``tests/interfaces/bluesky_web/test_channel_combobox_browser.py``).
