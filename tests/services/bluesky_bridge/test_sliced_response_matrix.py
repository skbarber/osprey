"""Unit tests for `orm_analysis.sliced_response_matrix`.

The vectorized, index-sliced ORM fit a plan's `render()` runs on every live
tick. Three things are actually load-bearing and get pinned here:

- it agrees with `numpy.polyfit` to 1e-12, so switching a fit onto it is not
  a change in answer, only in cost;
- it fits inputs `build_response_matrix` cannot take at all — a
  `monodirectional` sweep, and a run still in flight — because it slices by
  acquisition index instead of inferring corrector membership from the data;
- it is fast enough for the tick it runs on (a facility-scale shape here,
  well under the route's own budget).

Pure numpy, like the module under test: no bluesky, no bridge, no fixtures
beyond hand-built event rows.
