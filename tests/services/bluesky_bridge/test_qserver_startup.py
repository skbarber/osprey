"""Unit tests for the queueserver RE-worker startup script.

No queueserver process, no Redis, no IOC and no Tiled server is involved: the
startup script is a plain module, so its three products — the device set, the
plan namespace, and the document-plane subscriptions — are each built and
inspected directly.

Two doubles carry the suite. ``FakeConnector`` stands in for the OSPREY
control-system connector so real ``ConnectorSettable``/``ConnectorReadable``
instances can be built without Channel Access (the same idiom
``test_connector_devices.py`` uses). ``FakeRunEngine`` stands in for the
RunEngine wherever only ``subscribe`` matters; the one test that needs a real
event loop uses a real ``RunEngine``.

The namespace-shape test runs the actual queueserver namespace scanner
(``existing_plans_and_devices_from_nspace``) over the namespace this module
builds. That is the contract that matters — a plan the scanner does not
recognize is silently invisible to the manager, not an error — and
``bluesky_queueserver`` is a hard dependency of ``bluesky-queueserver-api``,
which OSPREY depends on directly, so the check always runs.
