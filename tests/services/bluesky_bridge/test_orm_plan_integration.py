"""RunEngine integration test for the shipped `orm` plan.

The bluesky stack is a core dependency, so these run in the normal unit
lane; the `pytest.importorskip` guards below only skip them in a slimmed
install where `bluesky`/`ophyd-async` are absent.

Drives a real bluesky `RunEngine` through the real `orm` plan
(`plans_core/orm.py`, resolved through the layered directory loader —
`plan_loader.get_facility_plans`, the sole plan registry) against mock
ophyd-async devices (`devices/mock.py`) — no EPICS, no container, and via
`bluesky_plan_drive.run_plan`, which wraps the plan exactly as the queueserver
worker's namespace does. Proves the
generator built there actually runs to completion and the live-row buffer
ends up with one row per (corrector, current) pair, every BPM column
present, and no hang.
