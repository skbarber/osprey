"""Tests for the fail-OPEN startup assertion.

`app.py`'s `_lifespan` hook refuses to start *writable* against an unreadable
limits source: it raises IFF ALL of writes are armed for the target THIS LANE
serves, `control_system.limits_checking.enabled` is true, AND the limits
database at `control_system.limits_checking.database_path` is missing,
unreadable, or unparseable. Every other combination starts normally — most
importantly, writes disabled must start read-only REGARDLESS of limits
readability, and must never even probe the database. See
`_assert_limits_readable_if_writable`'s docstring in `validation.py` for the
full condition and rationale.

The posture is per connector type, so which lane the container is
(`OSPREY_BLUESKY_LANE`) decides the answer: on a deployment that arms only its
virtual accelerator, the `va` lane must refuse and the `live` lane of the same
config must start.

The guard runs on EVERY startup, not only when some wiring flag is set: the
posture it refuses is a property of the project config, so a deployment that
never touches the queue must be checked exactly like one that does. That is
what `test_guard_runs_with_no_bluesky_env_set_at_all` pins.

Exercised here:

- writes_enabled + limits_enabled + DB missing -> entering the app lifespan
  raises.
- writes_enabled + limits_enabled + DB readable (valid channel_limits JSON)
  -> starts, `/health` 200.
- writes_enabled + limits_enabled disabled -> starts without any database
  configured at all.
- writes_enabled=False -> starts read-only even with a missing database, and
  the probe (`LimitsValidator._load_limits_database`) is never called.
- A mixed per-type config -> the armed lane refuses and the unarmed lane of
  the same config starts; a read-only run needs no database at all.
- The refusal message names the resolved per-type posture key and the lane it
  refused for, but never leaks the database file's contents.
- The other boot-time refusal in the same hook: a `BLUESKY_DEVICE_PAGE_SIZE`
  that is not a whole number >= 1 fails the start rather than the first
  request.

    Write posture is per connector type, so the guard reads the whole

    the `services.<lane>.target` its lane declares. Pass `writes_enabled` for
    a deployment whose only posture is the deployment-wide key; pass `section`
    (and `lane_targets`) for a config that arms one connector type and not
    another.

    Limits checking is per connector type too, and the guard reads it out of
    the same SECTION, so `limits_enabled` is folded into the section's
    `limits_checking` block rather than answered behind a dotted key. The copy
    is what keeps a module-level section constant (`_MIXED_SECTION`) from
    carrying one test's posture into the next. Only `database_path` stays
