"""The bridge's document plane: CurveZMQ-gated proxy -> dispatcher -> live rows.

Two things are load-bearing here and both are exercised against a real 0MQ
proxy rather than a mock, because both are properties of the sockets and not
of our Python:

1. **Documents published by an authenticated worker become live rows** under
   the OSPREY run id the enqueue path threaded through item metadata — the
   identity the read path looks runs up by — not the RunEngine uid, which the
   bridge never chose and cannot map back to an enqueued item.
2. **Documents published without the client key never arrive.** The
   queueserver container is dual-homed onto the shared network, so key
   authentication is the only thing protecting this socket; a regression that
   quietly dropped `in_curve` would be invisible to any test that only checks
   the happy path.

Proving an *absence* over 0MQ takes care, because a freshly connected PUB
socket drops everything it publishes before its handshake finishes — so "I
published a forgery and nothing showed up" is true whether or not the key was
ever checked. Two things make the negative assertion real: the forged
publisher republishes in a loop for seconds (far longer than an authorized
publisher needs to get a document through, which every test measures for
itself in `_establish_link`), and an authenticated document published
afterwards must still arrive, proving the plane never stopped delivering.
Swapping the forged publisher's config for a valid one must make this test
fail; it does.
