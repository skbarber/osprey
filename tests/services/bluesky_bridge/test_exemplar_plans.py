"""Coverage for the shipped accelerator plans: ``plans_core/orm.py``,
``plans_core/grid_scan.py``, and ``plans_core/orbit_bump_sweep.py``.

Runs ONLY in a bluesky-capable environment — `bluesky`/`ophyd-async` are
never installed in the main worktree venv, so every test here is skipped via
`pytest.importorskip` rather than failing, keeping `ci_check` green with no
bluesky installed at all. To actually run this file:

    uv venv /tmp/bluesky-exemplar-scratch
    /tmp/bluesky-exemplar-scratch/bin/pip install -e . --python 3.11
    /tmp/bluesky-exemplar-scratch/bin/python -m pytest \
        tests/services/bluesky_bridge/test_exemplar_plans.py -q

Two things are proven for each plan: (1) it registers through the real
layered-directory loader (`plan_loader.get_facility_plans`) with valid
metadata and `provenance == "shipped"` — i.e. the file satisfies the catalog
contract, not a hand-built `PlanSpec`; and (2) it drives a real bluesky
`RunEngine` to completion against mock devices, emitting documents — through
`bluesky_plan_drive.run_plan`, which wraps each plan exactly as the queueserver
worker's namespace does, so what runs here is the production call shape. `orm`'s own restore-in-`finally` abort-safety
(the FAILURE path) is covered separately by `test_builtin_plans.py`, which
drives its generator directly rather than through this registration path.
