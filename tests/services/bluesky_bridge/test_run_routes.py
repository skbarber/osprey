"""Wire contract for the `/runs` surface after in-process execution retired.

Two halves:

- **The read routes** (`GET /runs`, `GET /runs/{id}`) now derive their answers
  from the queue server rather than from any state the bridge keeps. These
  tests drive them through a real `QueueBackend` against a scripted manager, so
  what is pinned is the whole path — backend call, projection, response — not a
  stub of it. (`test_runs.py` pins the projection itself in isolation.)
- **The retired direct-execute routes** (`POST /runs`,
  `POST /runs/{id}/launch`, `POST /draft/run`, `POST /runs/{id}/stop`), which
  answer with the machine-readable `use_the_queue` refusal. Asserting the
  status code alone would let the body drift: a consumer branches on
  `detail.code`, so every test here asserts that code, and the sentence is
  checked for naming the route that took the capability over.
