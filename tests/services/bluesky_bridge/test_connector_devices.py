"""Unit tests for the connector-mediated ophyd-async device layer (task 1.1).

Runs ONLY in a bluesky-capable environment — `bluesky`/`ophyd-async` are
never installed in the main worktree venv, so every test here is skipped via
`pytest.importorskip` rather than failing, keeping `ci_check` green with no
bluesky installed at all. To actually run this file:

    uv venv /tmp/bluesky-connector-scratch
    /tmp/bluesky-connector-scratch/bin/pip install -e . --python 3.11
    /tmp/bluesky-connector-scratch/bin/python -m pytest \
        tests/services/bluesky_bridge/test_connector_devices.py -q

Exercises `ConnectorSettable`/`ConnectorReadable`/`build_devices` against a
FAKE OSPREY connector (no Channel Access, no Docker, no real IOC): a small
async stand-in exposing `read_channel`/`write_channel_checked`, mirroring
`test_orm_plan_integration.py`'s idiom of driving real bluesky machinery
against a lightweight double rather than a real control system. The whole
point of this device layer is that every read and write is mediated by the
connector, so the fake's call log is itself part of what these tests assert
on.
