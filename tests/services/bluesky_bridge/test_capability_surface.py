"""Contract tests for the capability record on the wire.

`queue_backend.py`'s own tests pin how the record is *derived*. These pin how it
is *published*: that the bridge's existing status surface carries it, that every
refusal reaches a consumer as a machine-readable code plus an actionable
sentence, and that the bluesky-web sidecar relays both untouched.

Three layers, deliberately:

- **Direct** — `GET /health` on the bridge app, driving the real `QueueBackend`
  against a scripted manager, so the wire shape is asserted against the actual
  derivation rather than a stub of it.
- **Relayed** — the sidecar's `GET /bridge/health` against a mock-transport
  bridge, pinning verbatim passthrough and the 502 the sidecar owes a caller
  when the bridge cannot be reached at all.
- **Both hops at once** — the sidecar's router in front of the *real* bridge
  app over an ASGI transport, so the browse-only refusal (the one whose text an
  operator has to act on) is proven to survive the whole path intact.
