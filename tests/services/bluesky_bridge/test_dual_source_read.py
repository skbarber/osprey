"""Tests for `get_run_data`'s dual-source branching.

`GET /runs/{run_id}/data` has two data sources: the live-row buffer
(`live_rows.py`) and Tiled (`_from_tiled`). This file tests only the BRANCHING
between them — which source gets consulted, and in what order — by mocking
`app_module._from_tiled` directly rather than a real or faked Tiled client
(that boundary is already covered by `test_data_route.py`). `_window`'s
pagination/truncation math is already covered by `test_read_bounded.py`'s live-
path tests and `test_data_route.py`'s Tiled-path tests; this file does not
re-test it.

The route holds no run state of its own: `run_id` is looked up in the buffer
directly. That single lookup is what makes both live-row keyings work — a
queue-executed run is buffered under its OSPREY run id by the document plane,
while a run reaching a bare recorder is buffered under the RunEngine's own uid
— and both are pinned below.

Exercised here:

- Live buffer present (even empty-but-partial): served from live, `_from_tiled`
  never called. The fallback trigger is `buf is None`, never falsy rows — a
  present-but-empty in-flight buffer must NOT be diverted to Tiled.
- Both buffer keyings resolve through the same lookup.
- Live buffer evicted (`live_rows._MAX_RUNS` exceeded), and never created at
  all: both fall back to `_from_tiled(run_id, ...)`.
- Neither source has the run: 404, not a 200-empty (the MCP tool maps 404 to
  `unknown_run`; a 200-empty would make a nonexistent run look like a valid
  empty run).
- Schema parity: a completed live-sourced response and a Tiled-sourced
  response carry the identical key set — including the `analysis` block, whose
  own keys are pinned to match across the two sources so an absent result reads
  the same either way.

The `_from_tiled` stubs below stand in for a function that computes an
`analysis` block from the snapshot it read, so they carry one: a stub whose
shape the real function never produces would let a missing key pass here and
fail only in production.
