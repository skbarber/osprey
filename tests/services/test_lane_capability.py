"""The lane identity a bridge publishes on its capability record.

A plan lane is a whole Bluesky stack wired, at render time, to ONE control
target. Two lanes mount the same project config, so the target a lane serves
cannot be read out of ``control_system.type`` alone — it comes from the lane's
own ``services.<lane>.target`` block, and which block that is comes from the
container's :data:`~osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.queue_backend.LANE_ENV`.

What these tests pin, in the order the record is built:

1. **The declared target wins.** A lane whose config block says ``target: va``
   reports ``va`` even when the deployment baseline says something else — that
   disagreement is the normal shape of the second lane, not an error.
2. **A legacy deployment still gets an honest answer.** No ``target:`` key is
   every single-lane deployment shipped so far; those derive the baseline by
   the SAME rule the host side uses (``target_banner.resolve_baseline_target``),
   and the two are asserted equal here rather than assumed.
3. **The record is STATIC.** The whole point of the producer split: the bridge
   reports its lane, the host composes the active/inactive view. A fabricated
   session switch — a real state file, written and then switched, exactly as
   the controls server would — must not move the bridge's record by one field.
   The bridge cannot even see that file from its container; this test is what
   keeps the code from quietly growing the ability to.
4. **Every consumer of the shape sees the fields**, including the hand-built
   fallback dict `/health` answers with when the capability probe itself
   explodes — the one path that does not go through ``Capability.to_dict``.
