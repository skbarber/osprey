"""Tutorial-rot guard for the shipped ``tutorial_triggers.yml``.

The ``control-assistant`` preset ships a bundled set of demonstration triggers
that double as the event-dispatch tutorial *and* as the definitions the
real-token e2e tests fire (``tests/e2e/test_dispatch_tutorial.py`` /
``test_dispatch_deploy.py``). If someone edits the shipped file — renames a
trigger, drops the safety demo, changes an allowlist — the tutorial, the docs,
and those e2e tests silently drift apart.

This test loads the REAL shipped file (not an inline fixture) through the same
``load_triggers()`` parser the dispatcher uses at runtime and pins the exact
contract: which triggers exist, their tool allowlists, and the intentional
compose-service ``dispatch_target``. It costs nothing (no tokens, no network)
and runs in the blocking ``pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e`` gate.
