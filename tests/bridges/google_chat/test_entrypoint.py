"""The bridge process's wiring: the boot refusal, the collaborators, the seams, the stop.

``__main__`` decides nothing about messages, so what is worth testing is the shape of
what it builds — and every property here is one whose absence produces a bridge that
still starts, still logs, and still looks healthy:

*  **an incomplete environment aborts, naming the variables.** Including the pair with
   code defaults (``DISPATCHER_URL``/``WORKER_URL``), which under compose arrive as
   empty strings rather than absent keys, so no default ever fires and the bridge would
   POST every question to a protocol-less URL forever.
*  **one Chat client and one deps bundle**, the latter carrying this channel's
   two-route prior-artifact fetcher rather than the engine's worker-only default.
*  **all four injected seams are honored** — Pub/Sub subscriber, Chat service, storage
   client, worker HTTP — because the end-to-end tier boots this exact wiring with fakes
   in all four, and a seam that were quietly ignored would send the test at Google.
*  **one :class:`threading.Event`**, from the signal handler through ``run_forever`` to
   the ingestion loop. A second one is a container that logs a tidy shutdown and then
   keeps leasing messages until it is killed.

No Google library is imported at collection or at run time: the Chat seam is exercised
with a hand-written discovery stand-in, the storage seam with a fake client, and both
HTTP legs over :class:`httpx.MockTransport`.
