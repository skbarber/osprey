"""The injected prior-artifact fetcher: worker byte route first, published URL second.

A follow-up question re-injects the bytes of an earlier turn's images. The engine's own
fetcher knows only the worker byte route, and for this channel that is the *ephemeral*
copy — swept once the run is old, gone after a restart — while the GCS object the space is
already linking to is permanent. Hence two routes, and hence this file: the fallback is
the branch a live conversation reaches days after the answer was posted, long after any
test would notice it missing.

Both routes are faked over :class:`httpx.MockTransport`, so a run's whole re-fetch is
deterministic and no network, credential, or Google library is involved. What the fetcher
returns is the engine's contract — ``(bytes, served content type)``, ``(None, None)`` for
every failure — and the served type is read off the response rather than off the
descriptor, because a mislabelled artifact must be skipped, never injected as an image.
