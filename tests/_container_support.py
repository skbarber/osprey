"""Shared helpers for testcontainers-backed tests.

Several test packages (``tests/connectors/``, ``tests/services/ariel_search/``,
``tests/e2e/``) spin up real containers and must degrade to a skip rather than
an error when the host has no Docker engine. This module is the single home for
the environment probes and start helpers they share.

Two start helpers live here because container suites split into two kinds, and
which one a suite wants is a real decision rather than a preference:
:func:`start_or_skip` for suites where an absent engine must not fail a
contributor's run, and :func:`start_or_fail` for suites that have already
established a daemon is present and for which a skip would be a vacuous green.
They sit side by side so that contrast is visible at the point of choosing.

The leading underscore keeps the module out of pytest collection: ``python_files``
matches ``test_*.py``/``*_test.py`` only, and a helper module that got collected
would report its imports as test failures.

Note on imports: ``docker`` is a ``dev``-extra dependency, so it is imported
lazily inside the functions that need it. A module-scope import would turn a
missing extra into a collection error for every test package that imports from
here. ``requests`` is a base dependency and is safe at module scope.

    """Start a container built by ``factory``, skipping the test on failure.

    ``factory`` must *build and return a new container object* on every call.
    A retry always builds a fresh one: ``DockerContainer.start()`` assigns
    ``self._container`` before the readiness wait, so reusing the object after a
    timeout would orphan the container started by the first attempt.

    The ``except`` chain is ordered, and the order is load-bearing because
    ``ImageNotFound ⊂ NotFound ⊂ APIError ⊂ RequestException``:

    * ``docker.errors.NotFound`` — a missing image or resource. Not transient,
      so skip immediately; a second 120s readiness wait cannot help.
    * ``requests.exceptions.RequestException`` or the BUILTIN ``ConnectionError``
      — a flaky daemon or registry call, or testcontainers' own port-publish
      race. Retried once after ``backoff`` seconds.
    * ``Exception`` — anything else, notably ``TimeoutError``. Skip immediately.

    The builtin ``ConnectionError`` is named explicitly because it is NOT one of
    the requests errors, however much it looks like one:
    ``requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`` is a ``RequestException`` and is
    caught by that arm, while the builtin sits on the other branch of
    ``OSError`` and is not. Testcontainers raises the builtin one directly when
    a container's port mapping is not published yet
    (``docker_client.py``, "Port mapping for container ... is not available"),
    which is the ryuk reaper racing its own port publish — testcontainers itself
    classes it transient (``waiting_utils.TRANSIENT_EXCEPTIONS``). Without this,
    that race fell through to the final ``except Exception`` and skipped on the
    spot, turning a whole container module into an all-skipped run that a reader
    cannot tell apart from a host with no Docker. A silent green on the only
    real-server coverage a route has is worse than a red one.

    A host with no Docker engine at all is untouched by this and still skips on
    the first attempt: ``docker.from_env()`` raises ``DockerException``, which is
    neither a ``RequestException`` nor a ``ConnectionError`` and lands in the
    final arm.

    ``backoff`` is keyword-only so tests can pass ``backoff=0`` instead of
    paying real wall clock for the retry sleep.

    Args:
        factory: Zero-argument callable returning a fresh, unstarted container.
        label: Human-readable name for the container, used in skip messages.
        backoff: Seconds to wait before the single retry.

    The fail-hard counterpart to :func:`start_or_skip`, for lanes that have
    already established a daemon is present. Two things make ``start_or_skip``
    wrong for such a lane, and dangerously so:

    1. Docker availability is checked before this is called, so past this point
       a container that will not start is a defect in the image, the corpus or
       the host, not an absent optional dependency — and a lane whose whole job
       is to prove a container-backed feature works must not be able to report
       success having executed nothing.
    2. The commonest failure is transient and ``start_or_skip`` does not retry
       it. testcontainers raises a **builtin** ``ConnectionError`` ("Port mapping
       for container ... is not available"). Builtin ``ConnectionError`` is an
       ``OSError``, not a ``requests.exceptions.RequestException``, so it lands
       in that helper's bare ``except Exception`` and skips on the first attempt.
       Observed on a second consecutive run: ``12 skipped ... exit 0``.

    **Reading the published port is part of the retried operation, not a step
    after it.** testcontainers queries the mapping the instant the container
    starts, so the same race bites twice. Retrying only ``start()`` leaves the
    second one live and it surfaces as a container that started fine and a test
    that died reading its port — observed as ``23 errors`` in a run whose
    containers were all healthy. Retrying inside the loop also means a failed
    attempt is discarded and a *fresh* container is built, rather than the port
    being re-read from the same one that never published it.

    Args:
        factory: Zero-argument callable returning a fresh, unstarted container.
