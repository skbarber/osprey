"""The gold-standard four-zone deployment repo, materialized for tests.

This module is the hand-authored reference deployment (``als-exemplar/``) that
the lifecycle verbs are developed against, and the shape ``osprey init`` must
emit. Exemplar-first: the content below was authored by hand, derived from the
``control-assistant`` preset emission and rewritten onto the new command
surface; ``init`` is then made to reproduce it, never the reverse.

The layout is the four-zone repo — one directory, four kinds of content::

    als-exemplar/
    │  ═ SOURCE — tracked, user-edited ═══════════════
    ├── profile.yml  triggers.yml  README.md
    ├── data/  personas/  web-terminal-context/
    ├── .gitignore  .env.example  .env.shared  ci-extra.yml
    ├── .gitlab-ci.yml  scripts/verify.sh   (with_ci=True only)
    │  ═ SECRETS — ignored, durable ══════════════════
    ├── .env                       (only with ``seed_env=True``)
    │  ═ OUTPUT — ignored, disposable ════════════════
    ├── build/                     (never materialized here: a build makes it)
    │  ═ STATE — ignored, durable ════════════════════
    └── var/agent_data/  var/audit/

``build/`` is deliberately absent. It is 100% derived, so the source repo the
exemplar models is the repo *before* any build has run — which is also the
fresh-clone state (SC-10). A test that needs a rendered build stubs one itself.

Two variants, and which one a caller wants is not a matter of taste:

``with_ci=False`` (the default) is the **init-reproducible** shape. A bare
``osprey init --preset control-assistant`` leaves the ``deploy:`` block a
commented stub, and with no deployment coordinates there is nothing to render a
CI pipeline from — so the repo carries neither ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` nor
``scripts/verify.sh``. This is the shape Task 2.1 compares ``init``'s emission
against, byte for byte.

``with_ci=True`` fills the coordinates in and adds the pipeline pair — the
shape ``osprey scaffold ci`` produces, and what Tasks 2.5 and 2.8 compare
against. ``image_source`` moves with the block: with deployment coordinates it
lives in the ``deploy:`` block and the ``config:`` block must not repeat it,
which the profile parser enforces.

Everything the profile says apart from the redesign's own concerns is the
bundled preset's content, written out verbatim from the standalone emission —
the full artifact lists, the Bluesky/virtual-accelerator stack, every
``config:`` key. The exemplar exists to pin the *form* ``init`` emits; the
content belongs to the preset, and a byte-for-byte gate is only satisfiable
that way. What the redesign does change: the four-zone header, comments moved
onto the new verb surface, the persona catalog pointed at ``build/`` and at
``personas/*.yml``, and the deploy block above.

Two values cannot be frozen into the text: the installed OSPREY version and the
bundled presets' content hashes, both of which the real emission stamps into the
provenance header. They are written as ``@OSPREY_VERSION@`` and
``@PRESET_HASH:<preset>@`` sentinels and expanded at materialization, so a
byte-comparison against a live ``osprey init`` stays meaningful as the repo
moves. Sentinels rather than ``str.format``/``%`` because the YAML carries
literal ``${VAR:-default}`` shell expansions.

Usage::

    def test_something(lifecycle_repo):          # als-exemplar/ in tmp_path
        assert (lifecycle_repo / "profile.yml").is_file()

    def test_two_checkouts(lifecycle_repo_factory, tmp_path):
        a = lifecycle_repo_factory(tmp_path / "a")
        b = lifecycle_repo_factory(tmp_path / "b", seed_env=True)

# Als Exemplar

This folder is your OSPREY assistant. Everything it is made of lives here, and
the folder name is the assistant's name.

## What is in here

| What | Where | In git? | Kept? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Your settings | `profile.yml`, `data/`, `personas/` | yes | yes |
| Your API keys | `.env` | no | yes |
| Generated files | `build/` | no | no, safe to delete |
| The agent's memory and audit log | `var/agent_data/`, `var/audit/` | no | yes |

In full, the first row is: `profile.yml`, `data/`, `personas/`, `triggers.yml`, `web-terminal-context/`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `.env.shared`, `README.md`, `ci-extra.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `scripts/verify.sh`.

`build/` is generated from your settings every time you run `osprey build`.
Deleting it is always safe: no settings, no keys and no agent memory live there.

## The `.env` files

Two of these are yours to edit, one is documentation, and anything else
starting with `.env` is generated by a deploy — kept out of git, and never
edited by hand.

| File | What it is for | In git? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.env.shared` | edit — the settings that are the same on every host | yes |
| `.env` | edit — this host's own values, and every key | no |
| `.env.example` | documentation — every variable this deployment reads | yes |
| `.env.merged` | generated — the settings a deploy hands the containers | no |

`.env.shared` and `.env` are read together, `.env` last: if the same
setting appears in both, the one in `.env` wins. That is how a single host
changes a shared default without affecting anyone else. None of these files go
into a container image — they are all read when the deployment starts.

`.osprey-compose.yml` at the root is generated the same way, so a deploy
can hand the container runtime one file instead of several. It is kept out of
git, holds no keys, is rewritten by every `osprey up`, and `osprey reset`
removes it.

## Everyday commands

```bash
osprey build          # turn your settings into something runnable
osprey up -d          # start it in the background
osprey status         # what is running, and is it up to date
osprey logs           # watch the logs
osprey down           # stop it
```

Run these from anywhere inside this folder. They find their way to the top on
their own, so they need no arguments. `--repo PATH` points them somewhere else.

## Changing something

Edit `profile.yml` (or run `osprey set model=sonnet` to change one setting),
then:

```bash
osprey build && osprey up -d
```

`osprey up` starts what `osprey build` last produced. If you change your
settings without rebuilding, `up` stops and tells you what changed, so a
half-finished edit cannot reach a running system. `osprey up --build` does both
steps; `osprey up --as-built` starts the previous build anyway.

## Running it on a server

To run this somewhere other than your own machine, fill in the `deploy:` section
at the end of `profile.yml` (which server, which CI system), then run:

```bash
osprey scaffold ci
```

That writes the pipeline files. Your own extra CI jobs go in `ci-extra.yml`,
which nothing ever overwrites.

## Starting over

```bash
osprey reset          # stops everything, then deletes containers, agent data and build/
```

`reset` keeps `var/audit/` and your API keys. `osprey reset --purge-audit`
deletes the audit log as well; that plus deleting this folder removes it all.

## Backups

Git covers your settings. `var/` and `.env` are everything else, so a backup
is a copy of those two, and a restore is:

```bash
git clone <this repo> && tar xf state.tar.gz && osprey build && osprey up -d
```

# Stage 2 — deploy.
#
# Manual and default-branch only: this is the single gate between a green
# pipeline and a running control-room service. `resource_group` serializes it
# so two operators pressing the button cannot interleave on the host.
#
# The host re-renders from the same commit rather than unpacking the artifact
# above, so what runs is reproducible from git alone. `git reset --hard` moves
# only what git tracks — the deployment's own .env and var/ are git-ignored by
# the repo's .gitignore, so the host's secrets and the agent's memory survive
# every deploy by construction. That is why nothing here copies files onto the
# host: an rsync of the working tree would have to be trusted not to delete
# them.
#
# `osprey users env` turns the host's .env into the runtime secrets
# file the web-terminal containers read, before any container starts. `--output`
# is what makes that safe, and it is not optional: without it the command writes
# the assembled secrets to stdout, which here is the job log. It also creates
# the file at mode 0600 from its first byte, which a shell redirect would not —
# on a shared deploy host the difference is every other account being able to
# read the deployment's credentials. The file lands at the repo root, where
# compose reads it, and .gitignore keeps it out of git — so the next deploy's
# `git reset --hard` leaves it alone.
#
# `osprey up` runs scripts/verify.sh afterwards on its own — the deploy's
# health report needs no job of its own.

# Vacuum System (VAC)

The vacuum system holds the storage ring at ultra-high vacuum so the stored
beam is not scattered out by residual gas.

## What it is made of

Ion pumps distributed around the ring do the continuous pumping; cold-cathode
gauges report pressure. Both are exposed as channels under `SR:VAC:`.

## Normal readings

Ring pressure sits near 1e-9 mbar with beam stored. A gauge above 1e-8 mbar is
worth investigating; above 1e-7 mbar the interlock trips the beam.

# Vacuum Recovery

Restores ring pressure after a vent or a pressure excursion.

## Steps

1. Confirm the affected sector from the gauge readings under `SR:VAC:GAUGE:`.
2. Verify the sector valves either side of it are closed.
3. Watch the sector's pressure fall; it should drop an order of magnitude an
   hour once the pumps are running.
4. Open the valves only once the sector is within one order of magnitude of
   its neighbours.

## Safety

Never open a sector valve against a pressure differential. The interlock will
refuse, and forcing it risks the whole ring's vacuum.
