"""Audit: test modules must not mutate process state at import time.

Import-time mutations are the one class of cross-test pollution a fixture
cannot undo — they run during collection, in whichever worker happens to
import the module, before any fixture of any scope gets a chance to snapshot
what they overwrote. This audit walks every module under ``tests/`` and
asserts that the set of import-time writes to ``os.environ``, ``sys.path``,
``sys.modules``, and sockets is *exactly* the whitelist below.

The whitelist is deliberately exact rather than a minimum: a new import-time
mutation fails this test, and removing a whitelisted one fails it too, so the
list cannot rot into a list of things that used to be true. Each whitelisted
site carries an inline ``# import-time required because ...`` comment at the
mutation itself explaining why a fixture cannot do the job.
