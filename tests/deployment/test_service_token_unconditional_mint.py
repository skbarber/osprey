"""Service-token minting is unconditional — it reads no execution/writes posture.

``_SERVICE_TOKEN_VARS`` entries are *network-caller authentication*: a token
proves the caller of a service's own HTTP boundary is the co-deployed agent
rather than anything else that can reach a shared loopback port. That is an
authentication concern, not a hardware-safety one. Whether a plan or a write is
permitted is decided at the connector — ``writes_enabled`` plus the per-put
channel limits — which every write path must clear: the agent's own
``write_channel`` calls and the bluesky bridge's plan execution alike end at the
same gate.

An earlier design withheld ``BLUESKY_LAUNCH_TOKEN`` whenever
``control_system.writes_enabled`` and ``execution.execution_method: local`` were
both set, on the theory that agent-authored Python could read the token out of
``.env`` and POST ``/runs/{id}/launch`` directly. Withholding it never closed
that path — it only made the bridge 503 while leaving the *shorter* route (the
agent writing channels through the connector) exactly as open, gated by the
connector as designed. So the withholding bought no safety and cost a deploy
that silently came up half-armed. It is gone, along with its allowlist:
``_ensure_service_tokens`` now mints every var a deployed service declares,
every time, and no code path consults ``execution_method`` for safety semantics.

These tests pin that. The property under test is *absence of coupling*: the
minted key set must be identical no matter what the execution and control-system
sections say — including when they are absent entirely.
