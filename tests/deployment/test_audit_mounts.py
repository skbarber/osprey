"""The audit mount: one subdirectory per identity, bound into its own container.

The unified audit ledger lives at ``var/audit/<identity>/`` on the deployment
host, and every containerized service that hosts an interface app or launches
framework MCP servers binds **only its own subdirectory** read-write. That
sentence carries three separable properties, and each one has a section here:

* **The mount follows the middleware, not the login wall.** A web terminal
  records under its own identity whether or not the deployment authenticates,
  and a dispatch worker — which hosts no interface app but launches the
  framework MCP servers through its CLI subprocess — gets the same mount as a
  terminal does. The emitters are therefore unconditional, which is also what
  keeps an ``auth.method: none`` render byte-identical to today's except for
  the audit lines themselves.

* **The isolation is the MOUNT, not a permission bit.** alice's container is
  handed ``var/audit/alice`` and nothing else under ``var/audit``, so bob's
  records are not merely unreadable to it — they are not in its filesystem to
  read. This is what makes "root and osprey never share a file" true by
  construction rather than by careful chmod.

* **The identity and the path are one derivation.** ``OSPREY_AUDIT_IDENTITY``
  is rendered from the same name that names the mount, so the identity a
  record is stamped with and the directory it lands in cannot come apart. A
  writer whose stamped identity and whose path disagree is an audit trail that
  attributes one user's actions to another, which is worse than no trail.

The host side has its own section at the bottom: the subdirectories are
provisioned setgid + group-writable *before* any container starts, on the same
inherit-never-invent precedent as the shared corpus, because a bind source left
to a rootful daemon comes up root-owned and the dropped ``osprey`` process
inside then writes nothing while the deployment looks healthy.
