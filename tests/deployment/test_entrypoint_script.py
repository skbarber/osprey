"""The entrypoint's root phase: mounted-group membership and the writer marker.

``entrypoint.sh`` runs as root and drops to ``osprey`` with ``gosu``. Two
properties of that root phase are load-bearing for the audit trail and are
asserted here:

**The group join.** ``gosu`` re-derives the dropped process's supplementary
groups from the image's ``/etc/group``, so a group granted at runtime (compose
``group_add:``) reaches the container's initial process and is discarded at the
drop. The bind-mounted audit subdir and facility bundle are owned by a HOST
group, and the dropped process reaches them through membership rather than
ownership — so the group has to be in ``/etc/group`` and ``osprey`` has to be
in it before ``exec gosu``. The set of directories is named by the render
(``OSPREY_AUDIT_DIR``, ``OSPREY_FACILITY_BUNDLE_DIR``, ``OSPREY_ARIEL_MIRROR_DIR``)
and the gid is stat'd off the mount, never passed in. Root and system gids are refused, because a mount
that presents one must not hand the agent's user a privileged group. And a
join is not claimed until it is VERIFIED: membership is the mechanism, while
write access to the mount is the property the audit trail depends on, so the
success line is emitted only after ``gosu osprey test -w`` says so.

**The writer marker.** ``OSPREY_AUDIT_WRITER=maintenance`` is a per-command
prefix on the maintenance interpreter, never a shell ``export`` — an export
would survive ``exec gosu`` (which preserves the environment) and stamp every
app-side record with the root phase's writer.

Everything here is script logic, so nothing is Linux-gated and nothing needs a
container: the run happens against stub ``stat``/``getent``/``groupadd``/
``usermod``/``gosu`` executables on a PATH that holds nothing else, with
fabricated gids in a stub's lookup table rather than real ``chown``ed
directories (which would need root). ``tests/cli/test_entrypoint_script.py``
owns the complementary assertions — that this script ships into the render
verbatim, and the regen/restore/hand-back order.
