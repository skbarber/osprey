"""Tests for the deploy-side render staleness advisory.

A render stamps its provenance (osprey version + resolved-profile hash) into
``.osprey-manifest.json`` at build time; ``osprey status`` compares that
against the installed framework and warns — never fails — when the render
predates the code deploying it. The check is fail-open by design: a render
without a manifest is reported on silently.

Distinct from the drift REFUSAL the start verbs apply
(``staleness.check_drift``, pinned in tests/deployment/test_up_as_built.py):
this advisory is the softer version-and-content comparison that reports rather
than blocks.
