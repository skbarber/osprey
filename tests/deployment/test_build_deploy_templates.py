"""Multi-user persona parity, held across the deploy split.

A facility with a persona catalog needs one web-terminal image per persona.
Building them in the pipeline would put a per-persona `osprey build` render and
a per-persona `build-web-terminal-<persona>` job in the CI template, guarded
only by string assertions against the shipped template text.

The pipeline builds no web-terminal images at all — the deploy host does, from
the persona catalog, when `osprey up` runs. This module holds both halves of
that split against the exemplar profile, which declares two personas: the
rendered pipeline must build no web-terminal image, and every referenced
persona must still come out as its own host-side build unit. Losing either
half loses multi-user support without any test going red.

The builder's own behavior (build args, dev wheels, the render check) is covered in
``tests/deployment/web_terminals/test_persona_images.py``; what is tested here
is only that the personas reach it.
