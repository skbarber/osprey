"""``osprey down`` and ``osprey restart`` — stopping a deployment repo, and cycling it.

Four properties, and everything here serves one of them.

**A stop never renders.** ``down`` acts on the compose files a build left and
re-derives none of them. The legacy ``osprey down`` re-rendered when it could not
find them, which produces a ``down`` aimed at the stack the *current* profile
would start rather than the one that is running. The tests assert that by the
absence of ``prepare_compose_files`` on every path.

**A stop that cannot find its compose files still stops the stack.** When
``build/`` is gone, ``down`` selects this checkout's containers by the
``com.osprey.repo-id`` label the render baked into them. The tests pin what that
sweep removes (containers, this repo's only), what it leaves (volumes, always;
the unlabelled network), and — the part that is easy to get wrong — that it says
so honestly when it finds nothing, because a stack created before OSPREY labelled
its containers is invisible to it and still running.

**A restart is a stop followed by a start, and the start is gated first.**
``compose restart`` restarts containers against the definition they were created
with, so a rebuilt image or a new token reaches nothing; these recreate them. And
every refusal a start can raise — drift, no build, a ``--dev`` that cannot be
honored — is raised while the running stack is still up. The tests assert both
halves: the ordering of the two compose invocations, and that a refused restart
stopped nothing.

**Volumes survive both verbs.** On every path, compose and label alike. Losing
data is ``osprey reset``'s job, and it asks first.
