"""One chain, every consumer: the env chain's cross-cutting matrix.

The deployment's environment is a chain of two files at the repo root —
``.env.shared`` (committed defaults) below ``.env`` (host-local secrets) — and
roughly a dozen unrelated mechanisms deliver it: compose reads it as an
``env_file:`` list, the CLI verbs load it into ``os.environ``, the build
lifecycle hands it to a subprocess, an MCP server reads it at startup, and the
web-terminal writer derives a file from it. Each of those has its own tests
next to its own code. What none of them can assert is the property the chain
actually promises: that **every** path answers the same question the same way.

So this module holds one fixture and asks it of all of them:

* the presence matrix — neither file, only ``.env``, only ``.env.shared``,
  both — across the three delivery shapes (what the render tells the templates,
  the ``--env-file`` argv a docker-shaped invocation carries, and the single
  merged file a podman-compose-shaped one is handed), plus the membership
  marker the render leaves behind for the deploy to check against;
* a conflict key set in BOTH files, resolved through every loader in the
  codebase. The expected answer is the same string on every row, so the table
  fails the day one loader disagrees — including the one that reaches it by
  loading the files in the opposite order.

The mechanics differ per path and are supposed to: a ``--env-file`` list and an
``override=True`` loader both let the LAST file win, an ``override=False``
loader lets the FIRST one win and therefore reads the chain reversed, and a
provider that keeps only the last ``--env-file`` it is handed gets one
pre-merged file instead of a list. This suite is deliberately blind to all of
that. It asserts the contract — ``.env`` wins, ``.env.shared`` is still
delivered — so a future "correction" that makes one mechanism's order look
like another's fails here rather than silently dropping the defaults half.

# `load_project_dotenv` overrides `os.environ` from the chain and records what
# each override replaced, so the deploy path can reconstruct the operator's
# shell — compose gives a shell export precedence over `--env-file`, and the
# shadow preflight is built on this record. With two files in play the record
# has to be taken against the value the chain ENDS on, once, rather than once
# per file against whatever the previous file said.
