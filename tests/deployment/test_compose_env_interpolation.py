"""Secrets bound for a compose ``env_file:`` must not contain ``$``.

Docker Compose interpolates the *values* it reads from an ``env_file:``, not
just the compose document. A ``$`` followed by an identifier character is
replaced with the named variable's value — the empty string when that name is
unset — so a ``$``-bearing secret arrives inside the container truncated. Two
variants carry no warning at all: ``$$`` collapses to a single ``$``, and a
``$`` followed by a name that *is* set on the deploy host splices the host's
value in. podman-compose mangles a different set — the braced ``${...}`` form
only, resolved against the same file's earlier entries before the host
environment — so the identical file can yield a different secret depending on
which implementation reads it.

The same substitution happens on the OTHER route out of a ``.env``: every
deploy runs compose with ``--env-file .env``, which makes it the variable source
for the compose *document*, so an ``environment: - X=${X}`` entry — how most
services here receive their secrets — resolves through it too. Measured on
Docker Compose v2.34, ``h0rse$battery`` becomes ``h0rse`` and ``secret$HOME``
becomes the deploy host's home path, the latter with no warning.

The failure is invisible from the host. The file on disk is byte-perfect, every
test that reads the file passes, and only the service that consumes the secret
refuses. These tests pin the guard at each boundary where a value OSPREY did not
mint can reach a container:

* ``.env.auth``   — the auth sidecar (includes the operator-appended OIDC secret)
* ``.env.users`` — every per-user web terminal
* ``.env``        — the compose document on every deploy, plus the dispatch
  worker, which receives the file wholesale

The rule is "no ``$`` at all", not "no interpolating ``$``". A trailing ``$``
survives Docker Compose today, but podman-compose is the documented default for
facility deploys and substitutes a different set, so no single escaping is
correct for both; the codebase already designs to a ``$``-free invariant
(``passwords.FIELD_SEP``, the minted alphabets in ``service_tokens``). A
rejected-but-harmless secret costs a rotation. A missed one is a silent outage.

Offending values are reported by variable *name* only — never echoed — matching
``_raise_invalid_var``'s existing discipline.
