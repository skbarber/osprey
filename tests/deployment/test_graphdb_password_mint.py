"""Unit tests for the Neo4j graph-store password in the token-mint map.

Mirrors ``test_postgres_password_mint.py``/``test_mongo_password_mint.py`` for
the ``graphdb`` deployed-service entry in ``_SERVICE_TOKEN_VARS``
(container_lifecycle.py): ``osprey up`` mints a strong ``GRAPHDB_PASSWORD``
into the project ``.env``, which the graphdb compose template will read as the
password half of the composite ``NEO4J_AUTH: "neo4j/${GRAPHDB_PASSWORD:-…}"``
and which the connection resolver hands the driver separately
(``driver(uri, auth=(user, password))``).

Two things make this credential different from the other store passwords, and
both are what these tests pin:

* the container variable is a **composite** ``user/password``, so a ``/`` in
  the value moves the split and the container comes up as a different user (or
  refuses to start) — the shared URI-safe rule already rejects ``/``, but this
  var states it on its own ground so a later loosening of that shared helper
  cannot silently take the composite with it;
* Neo4j enforces an **8-character minimum** on the initial password and
  crash-loops below it, so a short operator-supplied value has to be refused at
  the deploy boundary rather than at container start.

The external-store path is the third case: with an explicit
``services.graphdb.uri`` and ``graphdb`` absent from ``deployed_services``,
nothing mints this var — the operator sets it themselves and it is validated
when present, never fabricated when absent (the ``ARIEL_DSN`` validate-only
pattern).
