"""The qmd sidecar's two rendered artifacts, asserted on the rendered text.

The sidecar is a compose fragment plus a collection config, and the two only
work if they agree: the fragment mounts a corpus read-only at a path, and the
config declares a collection pointed at that same path. A mount with no
collection indexes nothing; a collection with no mount points at an empty
directory. Neither fails loudly — both surface as "search returns nothing" —
so the agreement is asserted here rather than assumed, and both renders go
through the production injection (``_inject_project_metadata``) so what is
tested is the derivation a deploy actually uses.

Four further properties carry the design and each has its own test:

* **The published port is the layout's ``qmd`` slot, never 8181.** qmd's own
  daemon hardcodes
  ``listen(port, "localhost")`` — no ``--host`` flag, no env override — so it
  answers only on a loopback address inside the container, unreachable from any
  other container. Which loopback family that is depends on the host: Node
  resolves ``localhost`` to ``[::1]`` on some image/host combinations and to
  ``127.0.0.1`` on others. So the entrypoint runs the daemon on an internal
  port, probes both families for ``/health``, and points a socat forwarder at
  whichever one answered; the forwarder owns the published port. Publishing
  8181 would publish nothing.
* **The publish interface is project-wide.** ``deployment.bind_address``
  decides it, and a per-service ``bind_address`` is deliberately inert — the
  endpoint is unauthenticated, so it must not be possible to expose it on an
  interface the rest of the stack is not on.
* **The index survives a recreate.** It is a named volume, not a bind and not
  container-local: rebuilding it costs ~41 minutes at ALS scale.
* **Pre-staged models are two edits or none.** ``services.qmd.models_dir`` gates
  a build arg (which tells the image build to skip the 2.1 GB of downloads) and
  a read-only bind mount (which supplies those same files at runtime). One
  without the other is the silent no-models failure: an image built with nothing
  baked in and nothing mounted. The last two sections assert that the two sites
  fire together, and that the literal strings they share with the image's
  Dockerfile still agree with it.
