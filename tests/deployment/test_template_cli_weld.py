"""The emitted pipeline's ``osprey`` commands, run through the real CLI parser.

``tests/cli/test_emitted_artifacts_clean.py`` proves the templates render the
hand-authored exemplar byte for byte. That says nothing about whether the
commands inside them exist. A template can reproduce its specification perfectly
and still name a flag that was renamed three releases ago — the specification
was hand-written against the CLI as it was, and nothing since then has
re-checked it. The pipeline only finds out in CI, on a facility's deploy day.

This module welds the two halves together: it renders the pipeline through the
real emission engine, pulls every ``osprey`` invocation out of the rendered
YAML, and drives each one through the real ``osprey`` command tree. A flag that
no longer exists, a verb that was moved under a different group, an argument
that changed arity — each one fails here, in this repo, at the commit that
caused it.

Parse, not execute
------------------

Nothing here runs a command body. ``Command.make_context`` does the whole
parsing layer — option lookup, type conversion, arity and required-argument
checks — and then stops; ``Command.invoke`` is what would call the function
underneath, and it is never reached. So the harness walks the command tree by
hand: make a context for the group, take the tokens it did not consume, ask the
group to resolve the next name, repeat until a leaf command holds them all.

That also keeps the root group's callback out of it. ``osprey``'s own callback
loads ``.env`` into the process environment, configures logging, and launches
the interactive menu when no subcommand follows — all things a test must not
trigger, and all things ``make_context`` skips.

What a failure looks like is therefore unambiguous. Every way the CLI can reject
an argv shape raises :class:`click.UsageError` — ``NoSuchOption`` and
``NoSuchCommand`` are both subclasses, and all of them carry ``exit_code == 2``.
Nothing else can raise from a parse. Working at the exception layer rather than
on rendered output also sidesteps Click's ``CliRunner``, whose Rich-wrapped
stdout breaks any assertion on error text.

Concrete values
---------------

The pipeline's invocations carry no arguments at all: the repo IS the
deployment, so every verb walks up to the profile from wherever it runs. The
harness still expands any ``$NAME`` against the pipeline's own ``variables:``
block — so the substitution is the pipeline's and not the test's opinion of it —
and still parses from inside a real repo, because part of what a parse checks is
the filesystem.
