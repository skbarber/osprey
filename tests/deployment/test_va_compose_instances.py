"""The Virtual Accelerator instance axis across the compose render.

An *instance* is one PyAT-backed EPICS soft-IOC container. Every project
rendered before this feature has exactly one, and the second is opt-in
(``virtual_accelerator.live_standin``), which makes the build write a
``services.live_standin`` block beside ``services.virtual_accelerator`` and
append ``live_standin`` to ``deployed_services``. Three things are per
instance: the compose service key (and so the in-network CA address), the
published port, and the BPM-offset perturbation that makes the stand-in read
differently from the machine it stands in for.

Two claims are tested here, and the first one is the anchor:

1. **A single-instance deployment renders byte-for-byte what it rendered
   before.** Not "parses to the same YAML" — literally the same bytes. The
   goldens under ``goldens/va_single_instance/`` were produced from the
   template as it stood before the instance axis existed, so a diff against
   them is a diff against history. Every existing project is single-instance,
   so this is the whole compatibility surface of the change.

2. **A two-instance deployment separates the two machines.** Distinct service
   keys, container names, published ports and CA server ports, one build, and
   a stand-in whose readout perturbation comes from its own host variable —
   because an operator, a scenario and the host-port preflight all have to be
   able to say which of the two machines they mean.

The scenario mounts are the deliberate exception: both instances read the same
model and the same active-scenario state, which is what lets one
``osprey sim apply`` be observed on both machines at once.
