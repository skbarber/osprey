"""A deploy that runs ARIEL's Postgres also makes it usable.

Before this, ``osprey up`` started the ARIEL store and stopped there: nothing on
the deploy path ever created the schema, so a first bring-up left a database with
no tables, an ARIEL panel that reported the database unavailable, and an `ariel`
MCP server whose every tool failed on a missing relation. Migrations existed only
behind commands an operator had to know to run (``osprey ariel migrate`` /
``quickstart``), which is knowledge a turn-key preset cannot assume.

Staging ARIEL is therefore the logbook counterpart of ``_stage_archiver_store``:
start the store, wait for it, create the schema, and — on a first bring-up only —
write the narrative the active scenarios document.
