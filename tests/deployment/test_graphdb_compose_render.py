"""Render tests for the graphdb service's container healthcheck.

The healthcheck runs INSIDE the ``neo4j:<ver>-community`` container, so the
probe binary has to be one that image actually carries. It ships ``wget`` (the
entrypoint itself fetches the n10s jar with it) and no ``curl`` — a probe that
shells curl fails on every attempt with "command not found", and the container
settles into ``unhealthy`` permanently while the store serves normally. That
false negative poisons everything that treats container health as ground
truth: ``podman ps``, smoke rosters, and any ``depends_on: service_healthy``
gate (issue #717).

These tests render the packaged compose template exactly as ``osprey up``
does and pin the probe to the binary the default image has, on both network
modes — the bridge default (container-internal 7474) and ``host`` (the
published port, since there is no port map left to translate).
