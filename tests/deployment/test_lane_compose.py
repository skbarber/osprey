"""The Bluesky plan-lane axis across the deploy surface.

A *lane* is a full Bluesky stack — bridge + RE Manager + its own Redis — bound
at render time to the control-system target it serves. Every project rendered
before this feature has exactly one, and the second lane is opt-in
(``bluesky.second_lane``). Four resources that were single-set are now
per-lane: the document-plane CURVE certificates, the launch token, Redis, and
the host-port map. Tiled is the one shared component and stays on lane 1.

Two claims are tested here, and the first one is the anchor:

1. **A single-lane deployment renders byte-for-byte what it rendered before.**
   Not "parses to the same YAML" — literally the same bytes. The goldens under
   ``goldens/bluesky_single_lane/`` were produced from the template as it stood
   before the lane axis existed, so a diff against them is a diff against
   history. Every existing project is single-lane, so this is the whole
   compatibility surface of the change.

2. **A two-lane deployment isolates the two lanes.** Separate bridges,
   managers, Redis instances, internal networks, CURVE certificate
   directories, launch tokens and host ports — because a shared resource on
   any one of those axes lets either lane's bridge drive the other lane's
   manager, which is exactly the confusion between "which machine am I talking
   to" that the run-time target switch exists to make explicit.
