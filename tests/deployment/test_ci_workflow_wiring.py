"""Assertions against the parsed `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, proving the
secret-free Docker-stack e2e lanes (Tiled roundtrip, VA substrate
equivalence, control-assistant demo) are correctly wired — and that every
``dockerbuild``-marked e2e file stays out of the shared e2e-tests lane.

Everything here loads ci.yml with ``yaml.safe_load`` and asserts against the
parsed structure — never a text/regex match, so re-flowing YAML style can't
fool a check. YAML 1.1 parses the bare `on:` workflow-trigger key to the
Python boolean ``True``; this module never indexes ``workflow["on"]``.

Two secret-free jobs exist because two e2e files needed one each:

* ``test_tiled_roundtrip.py`` (Task 4.1) is new in this phase and never had
  a lane at all.
* ``test_va_substrate_equivalence.py`` (Phase 1) had a CI bug: it carried no
  dedicated job and was only ever swept up by ``e2e-tests``' glob over
  ``tests/e2e/`` — contradicting its own module docstring ("never collected
  by the fast lane"). Fixing that means giving it a real lane, not just
  removing its only lane via ``--ignore``.

Every assertion is paired with a mutation test: a fresh, in-memory-mutated
copy of the parsed workflow reintroduces exactly the bug the assertion
exists to catch, and the same assertion must then fail. ci.yml itself is
never edited by this module.

One check reads a source file rather than the parsed workflow: the unit
lane's ``--dist loadgroup`` flag is only safe because ``tests/conftest.py``
overrides ``pytest_xdist_make_scheduler``, and that override lives in
Python, not in YAML. Its *behaviour* is covered by
``tests/infrastructure/test_xdist_scheduler.py``; what is pinned here is the
pairing — the flag in ci.yml must never outlive the scheduler behind it.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Two jobs are asserted here because the coverage is deliberately split in two.
# `two-shape-boot-e2e` is the real thing — it boots the dispatcher/worker pair
# twice, once per network shape, on a rootless podman runner. The parse-only
# step in `static-checks` is the cheap half: it renders the same kind of
# deployment and hands podman-compose OSPREY's own argv, so a merged document
# that no longer parses, or an env chain that stops interpolating, is caught in
# a Tier 0 job in seconds rather than after a ~20-minute image build.
#
# The provider is the load-bearing fact for both. `podman compose` delegates to
# whichever external provider it finds, and on a GitHub runner the first one is
# the docker-compose CLI plugin — the engine the docker lanes already cover,
# and one that accepts the `--project-directory` this argv deliberately omits.
# A lane that quietly ran the plugin would report green having tested nothing
# new, which is why the pin, the force and the assertion are each checked
# independently below.
