"""Persona clients must follow the ports their hosting deployment actually publishes.

The invariant under test: **an attached render dials the ports its hosting
deployment actually publishes.** Web-terminal persona projects (the
``control-assistant-{readonly,readwrite,ariel}`` presets) render as *attached*
projects whose ``services:`` carries no ``bluesky`` or ``virtual_accelerator``
block, so several in-container clients resolve their endpoint through a
fallback chain that bottoms out in a compiled-in default. At the shipped
defaults that default happens to equal the port the host publishes — so every
existing test passes while proving nothing about *following*. This module
breaks the coincidence: it builds one control-assistant stack whose hosting
profile MOVES the ports, confirms the host render moved (the premise), then
resolves each endpoint exactly the way the in-container client does and
asserts the persona followed.

Closest existing tests, and why they were blind:

* ``tests/cli/test_profile_va_archiver_block.py`` proves the invariant for the
  one client that does it right — ``va_archiver_config_overrides`` derives
  ``archiver.mongodb_archiver.*`` for attached renders from the hosting
  profile, and refuses an attached profile without ``va_archiver.host``. It
  never looks at the bluesky, VA-gateway, or telemetry clients.
* ``tests/services/ariel_search/test_dsn_derivation.py`` proves
  ``resolve_ariel_dsn`` follows ``services.postgresql`` when the block is
  present — but it hands the resolver hand-built dicts and never renders an
  attached persona, so it cannot say what block a persona actually has.
* ``tests/deployment/test_persona_reach_endpoints.py`` catches the telemetry
  endpoint deriving a wrong HOST under ``network_mode: host`` — at the shipped
  default ports. It never moves a port, so port drift stays invisible there
  for every client.
* ``tests/cli/test_persona_presets.py`` builds this same stack — at default
  ports, where "follows the config" and "hardcodes the default" produce
  identical renders.

One candidate client is deliberately NOT parametrized here: the ARIEL
Postgres DSN. Its only operator-facing port lever is the profile's
``config: services.postgresql.port_host`` dotted key, and a persona profile is
the persona delta merged over the hosting ``profile.yml`` — ``config:``
overlay included — so the moved key lands in every persona render's own
``services.postgresql`` block and ``resolve_ariel_dsn`` follows it (verified:
with ``services.postgresql.port_host: 15432`` on the hosting profile, every
persona render carries the same block and the derived DSN dials 15432). That
client already satisfies the invariant; asserting drift for it would fail to
fail.
