"""``osprey status`` and ``osprey logs`` — the two read-only lifecycle verbs.

Four properties, and everything here serves one of them.

**Neither verb changes anything.** No render, no start, no stop, no write into
the repo. The tests assert that positively — the tree is compared file by file
across a status run, and the only runtime commands either verb is allowed to
issue are listings and ``logs``.

**Status answers about THIS checkout.** Two clones of one deployment on a single
host share a project name and a volume namespace, so containers are sorted by
the ``com.osprey.repo-id`` label a build bakes in. The tests pin all four
outcomes of that sort, including the two that are easy to get quietly wrong: a
container from the *other* checkout must never be reported as this
deployment's, and a container carrying no label at all must be reported with the
reason it cannot be found by label.

**Status never reports a failure as an absence.** A runtime that cannot be
queried is not an empty deployment, and an artifact check that cannot run is not
an artifact check that passed. Both say so.

**Logs is a wrapper, not a reimplementation.** It builds its invocation through
the pinned compose contract, carries both stacks' compose files, and pins
``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`` — the three things that decide whether compose looks at
this deployment's containers or at nothing at all.
