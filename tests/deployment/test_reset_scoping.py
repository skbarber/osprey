"""``osprey reset`` — what it is allowed to destroy, and what it must not.

Reset is the only OSPREY verb that removes data, so these tests are written
around the two ways it can be wrong rather than around its features.

**It can destroy the wrong deployment.** A compose project name is the repo's
directory NAME, so two clones or worktrees of one deployment on a host share a
project name and a volume namespace. Everything under "the scoping rule" below
exists to pin the two-condition gate — project name AND this checkout's
``com.osprey.repo-id`` — and, above all, the refusal: a same-named resource
carrying a different identity stops the whole reset and removes nothing.

The refusal's *wording* is tested as carefully as its behaviour, because it has
two branches that know different amounts and neither may borrow the other's
confidence. A container carries compose's ``working_dir`` label, so the other
repo's path can be named; a volume carries no path label at all, and since the
identity is a one-way hash of that path there is nothing to name. Branch B must
say so rather than guess, and must not send an operator to a repo it cannot
identify. Both are tested apart, each asserting what its branch says AND what it
must not.

**It can promise something other than what it does.** For a destructive verb a
plan that overstates is a lie an operator acts on, and a plan that understates
destroys something they did not agree to. So the plan and the execution are the
same object, and the tests assert the equality in BOTH directions: every removal
argv names something the plan printed, and everything the plan printed got a
removal argv.

No test here reaches a container runtime. Every one drives
:class:`~osprey.deployment.reset.RuntimeProbe` through an injected runner that
records argv, which is also what lets the argv themselves be asserted on — that
none is a ``prune``, an ``-a``, a wildcard, or a ``down -v``.
