"""The navigation-only perimeter stamp on every per-user web-terminal service.

Under ``auth.method: none`` the perimeter is nginx alone: it injects each
user's operator secret on every proxied location, so a request that reaches a
web port from the deploy host arrives already authenticated as whoever owns
that port — including a request made by agent-generated code inside one of
these containers, which share the host network namespace with each other and
with nginx.

The render's half of the answer is these two lines on each per-user service:
``OSPREY_WEB_PERIMETER=open`` (the posture) and
``OSPREY_WEB_PERIMETER_DENY_PORTS`` (nginx's published port, the TLS listener
when ``tls.enabled`` puts the real content server behind it, and every roster
user's terminal port). The MCP server process inside the container reads them
and hands the parsed list to the execution sandbox it spawns — which is what
makes the deny-list something the sandbox is TOLD rather than something it
derives, and why the list has to be computed here, where the whole roster is
known.

The three credentialed methods render neither line: a caller there still has to
present something the sandbox does not hold, so there is nothing to deny.
