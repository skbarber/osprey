"""Golden-fixture byte-equality baseline for `render_web_terminals()` (PLAN Task 1.1).

This is the FIRST guard committed before any persona-render change lands (P4
personas/portability). Its job is narrow and mechanical: pin today's rendered
output for a representative, no-personas facility config so any *unintended*
drift in Task 2's render threading (`render.py`, `docker-compose.web.yml.j2`,
`seeding.py`) shows up as a byte-diff here, immediately, rather than as a
runtime surprise in a downstream lifecycle/e2e test.

**Update discipline** — read this before touching the golden files:
  - A failure here means the rendered compose/nginx/landing output changed.
    That is NOT automatically a bug: personas threading (Task 2.1) is
    *expected* to eventually touch `docker-compose.web.yml.j2` (at minimum,
    the new `OSPREY_TERMINAL_WEB_PORT` declaration line — see PROPOSAL.md's
    Scope section, "the one known case").
  - Byte-equality exists to guard against DRIFT, not to freeze the templates
    forever. When a render change is deliberate and reviewed, re-generate the
    three files under `golden/` from the new `render_web_terminals()` output
    in the SAME reviewed change that made the template edit (never as a
    separate, unreviewed "make the test pass again" commit) — so the diff a
    reviewer sees is exactly: template change + the resulting golden delta,
    side by side.
  - To regenerate: call `render_web_terminals(EXAMPLE_CONFIG)` (defined
    below) and overwrite `golden/docker-compose.web.yml`,
    `golden/nginx.conf`, and `golden/landing.html` with the three returned
    values (`docker-compose.web.yml`, `nginx/nginx.conf`, and
    `nginx/landing.html` respectively). Do not hand-edit the golden files.

``EXAMPLE_CONFIG`` is the reference "no-personas" shape a facility profile's
web-terminals section is patterned on: two bare-string users, the `users` +
`links` landing groups, and no `personas:` block.
