"""Durable `nginx -t` validation of the rendered nginx fragment.

`test_render.py`'s and `test_auth_tls_seams.py`'s assertions are string matches
on the Jinja output — cheap and fast, but they can't catch an nginx syntax error
the strings happen to satisfy. This module closes that gap for real by actually
invoking `nginx -t` inside `nginx:1.27-alpine` (the base image the deployed stack
uses) against each render shape the auth/TLS seams can produce:

- the default render (`auth.method` unset -> "token", `tls.enabled` unset ->
  False): no wall and no injection, each terminal reached through its own
  `?token=` exchange — the pre-auth plain-http posture.
- the fully enabled render (`tls.enabled: true` with a real self-signed cert/key
  pair generated fresh per test run, plus `auth.method: password`): two server
  blocks, the plain port's `return 301 https://…`, `listen 443 ssl` +
  `ssl_certificate*`, the two `map`s, a per-user `auth_request` and `internal`
  verify target, the shared named 401 handler, and the public `/auth/` prefix.
- that same enabled render moved off 443 by `tls.port` — the rootless shape,
  where both `listen ... ssl` lines bind an unprivileged port and the cleartext
  server's 301 has to name that port in its `Location` or the bounce lands
  where nothing is serving.
- the cleartext-auth render (`auth.method: password` with
  `allow_insecure_http`, the shape a facility behind its own TLS terminator
  deploys): the same auth surface inside a *single* server block.
- the open render (`auth.method: none`, with a `login: false` entry beside a
  normal one): no sidecar surface at all, and yet the per-user `include` +
  envsubst chain still runs — the only shape where a secret snippet is read at
  start with no `auth_request` in front of it, and the only one whose two
  ungated locations are shaped differently from each other.

Every one of these tests asserts the constructs it means to validate are
actually present in the rendered fragment before handing it to nginx — a
template that stopped emitting the auth surface would otherwise still "pass"
`nginx -t` and report a vacuous green.

Skipped entirely when docker (or openssl) is unavailable, mirroring
`tests/e2e/test_dockerfile_e2e.py`'s `_docker_available()` pattern.
