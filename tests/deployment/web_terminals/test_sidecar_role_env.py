"""How a role reaches the auth sidecar — two inputs, and what each is for.

There are exactly two, and each has its own end of the compose overlay to cross:

* the deployment's GROUP BINDING, under `oidc` only. `_authorization_context()`
  parses `modules.web_terminals.authorization.claims` into
  `authorization_claim` / `authorization_claim_map`, and the sidecar's
  `RoleBinding.from_env()` reads it back out of `OSPREY_AUTH_ROLE_CLAIM` /
  `OSPREY_AUTH_ROLE_MAP`. It says which role a validated ID token resolves to.
* the ROSTER's own `role:`, under BOTH login methods, carried per user onto
  render.py's service dicts and read back by `RosterRoles.from_env()` out of
  `OSPREY_AUTH_ROSTER_ROLE_<SUFFIX>`. It is what the render resolved this user's
  persona from — so it is the session role under `password`, and under `oidc`
  it is the CROSS-CHECK TARGET the claim's role must agree with.

The compose overlay is the only thing joining either pair of ends, and until it
emitted these lines the feature was dark on both sides: a deployment with a
claim map, or with a roster full of roles, resolved no role at all. Deny-safe,
and invisible.

Only one of them is gated on the method, and the asymmetry is the point: a claim
binding under `password` would be read out of an ID token nobody presented, so
it is absent there — while the roster role is emitted under both, because a
container is rendered from it either way and the federated posture needs it to
have something to cross-check against. Both gates are asserted here.

These tests assert on the two ends together — the exact rendered text, and the
table the sidecar's own parser builds from it — because either end alone can be
self-consistently wrong. Every variable name is imported from the sidecar rather
than spelled out here, so a rename on that side fails here instead of silently
rendering a variable nothing reads.
