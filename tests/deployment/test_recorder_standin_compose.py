"""Which machine the archiver recorder records, across the compose render.

The recorder samples one IOC over Channel Access and writes what it reads into
the archiver store. Until the live stand-in existed there was only ever one IOC
it could mean — the co-deployed ``virtual_accelerator`` — so the template named
that service outright at both wiring sites.

A deployment that stands a live stand-in up has two IOCs, and the choice between
them is not arbitrary: **the archive belongs to the machine it records.** A
deployment that records its own store beside a stand-in records the stand-in —
its present is what the store goes on holding and its past is what the deploy
seeded — so ``live-standin``, and not the sandbox VA beside it, is what gets
recorded.

Two claims are tested here, and the first one is the anchor:

1. **A deployment without a stand-in renders byte-for-byte what it rendered
   before.** Not "parses to the same YAML" — literally the same bytes. The
   goldens under ``goldens/recorder_no_standin/`` were produced from the
   template as it stood before the recorded-machine choice existed, so a diff
   against them is a diff against history. Both branches of the pre-existing
   condition are pinned (a co-deployed VA and an external IOC), because that
   condition is still read at three sites and either branch could drift.

2. **A deployment with a stand-in retargets both wiring sites together.** The
   Channel Access address and the startup dependency have to name the SAME
   instance — a recorder that waits on one machine and reads from another is a
   deploy-time race that looks like an empty archive — so the template derives
   both from one choice made once, and these tests read them back separately.

The image is deliberately not part of the choice: the stand-in is the same IOC
image serving a perturbed copy of the same machine, so the recorder runs the VA
image either way, exactly as it did before.
