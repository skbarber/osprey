"""A deploy that runs the graph store also makes it answer questions.

Before this, ``osprey up`` would start the Neo4j container and stop there: the
store came up bootstrapped by nobody and empty, so every Cypher query answered
zero rows and the operator's only signal was "the data looks wrong". Seeding
lived behind a verb an operator had to know to run, which a turn-key preset
cannot assume.

Staging the graph store is therefore the knowledge-graph counterpart of
``_stage_ariel_store``: start the store alone, wait for it, bootstrap it, and —
on a first bring-up only — import the configured TTL. Every failure here warns
and names ``osprey knowledge seed-graph``; none of them aborts the deploy, because
a control room whose channels, plans and archive are up should not be denied them
over a search index.
