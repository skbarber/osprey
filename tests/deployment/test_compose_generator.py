"""Framework-guard tests for projects with empty deployed_services.

An "attached" project (built with ``deploy_services: false``, connecting to
another project's already-deployed services stack) is what declares no
deployed_services — the hello-world preset's own default build deploys one
service (openobserve). Two failure modes have to stay fixed for the empty
case:

1. ``osprey build`` must still copy the root ``services/docker-compose.yml.j2``
   into the project, because the renderer references it unconditionally.
2. ``osprey up`` must succeed (graceful no-op) instead of dying with
   ``TemplateNotFound`` mid-render.

# environment, so the worker compose service declares ``env_file: ./.env``
# — read by the compose CLI on the HOST (as the file's owner) and injected
# into the container environment. This works even though the project ``.env``
# is deliberately 0600 and the worker runs as non-root ``osprey``: the
# container itself never opens the file, so a uid mismatch can't EACCES it
# (unlike a bind mount, which the non-root process must open itself). Gated
# on ``.env`` existence — an ``env_file:`` entry whose path is missing errors
# ``compose up`` outright.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# project at /app/<project> (Dockerfile ``COPY . /app/{{ project_name }}/``). The

# ``_inject_project_metadata`` into ``osprey_labels.project_name`` (and the
# ``<project>:local`` image tag), both from a single ``resolve_project_name(config)``

# namespace they share one port space, so worker `i` takes

# preflight derive too, which is why the template derives it from the same two
# config keys rather than restating the step.

# Host mode also moves every address the worker is HANDED. The store links
# below name compose service DNS, which resolves to nothing outside the
# network; on the host they become localhost plus the port each store
# publishes. And the worker binds loopback rather than every interface, because
# there its socket is a host socket with no network boundary in front of it.
#
# Under bridge — the default, and what a config that never heard of the axis
# renders — every block here is the one this file carried before, so adopting
# the axis moves no existing deployment.

    127.0.0.1 (unreachable from the bridge container) without ``--host``.
    ``TiledWriter`` appends event tables via ``create_appendable_table`` +
    ``append_partition``, which need SQL-family storage — hence the
    ``duckdb://`` writable target alongside the filesystem one.

    is the standard SQLAlchemy DBAPI URI convention where an empty host
    segment leaves the path relative (three slashes, resolved against the
    container's CWD) or absolute (four slashes). Three slashes resolved to

    creates it root:root and the uid=999 tiled process can't open a catalog
    DB there — the container exits 1 immediately and /healthz never answers.
    This is a render-time assertion only: it pins the path the fix depends

# Container config staging: no host interpreter can reach the container
#
# The M2 concern: the dispatch worker's runtime config.yml must never carry
# the HOST build machine's interpreter (e.g. ``/Users/.../.venv/bin/python``)
# into the container — that path does not exist in-container, and MCP-server
# command generation used to prefer it over ``sys.executable``, so every MCP
# server would fail to launch. Two properties now make that unreachable, with
# no staging-time surgery:
#
# 1. A generated project's config records no interpreter at all — there is no
#    ``execution.python_env_path`` for staging to carry across. (An older
#    config that still carries the retired key stages verbatim, but
#    ``ConfigBuilder`` drops it on load.)
# 2. ``build_claude_code_context`` (osprey.cli.templates.claude_code) derives
#    ``current_python_env`` from the filesystem — the project's own ``.venv``
#    when it has one, else the generating interpreter — and consults the config
#    not at all. A ``project_root_override`` (the container case) forces the
#    generating interpreter, since the host's venv is not what exists in the
#    container. So no config, of any vintage, can name the interpreter an MCP
#    server launches with.
#
# ``setup_build_dir`` therefore stages the flattened config as-is; the strip it
# used to perform removed a key nothing writes and nothing reads. These tests
# prove the invariant against the real generator entrypoints. The full
# role-split contract (all three runtime launch sites, driven with a config
# that points somewhere else) lives in tests/cli/test_interpreter_role_split.py.

# rebuild would invalidate the image layer cache even with no code change.
# This gate builds the wheel twice for real (memo reset in between) and pins
# byte-identity via sha256.
#
# Both builds necessarily read the LIVE source root — hatch-vcs needs the real
# git checkout to derive the version, so the tree cannot be snapshotted into
# tmp_path. That makes "identical source" a premise the test must verify rather
# than assume: any write under ``src/`` between the two builds (an editor save,
# a formatter, a concurrent process) makes the two wheels legitimately differ
# and the assertion would report build nondeterminism that does not exist. So
# each round is bracketed by a content snapshot of the packaged inputs, and the
# comparison is only made once a round provably saw the same tree twice.
#
# Exhausting the retries is a FAILURE, not a skip. Nothing writes under ``src/``
# during a CI test run, so a tree that churns through every attempt is a real
# anomaly worth a red rather than a condition to tolerate — and a skip here
# would exit 0 and read as success to any gate that does not assert on skip
# counts.

#     here rather than only string-matched — a renamed env var is dead config the
#     runtime silently ignores, which no substring assertion would catch;
#   * that block is also the ONLY way configuration reaches this service: it
#     declares no ``env_file:``, so the project .env's provider keys never enter
#     the container that faces the external Nextcloud instance.
