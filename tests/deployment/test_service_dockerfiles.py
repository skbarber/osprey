"""Build invariants for the shipped service Dockerfiles.

`osprey up` builds each managed service from a template Dockerfile shipped
under ``osprey/templates/services/<name>/``. Two sets of checks live here, over
two different sets of files.

The **layer-split contract**, over the four framework-primed services
(event_dispatcher, virtual_accelerator, bluesky, bluesky_web) that
:data:`PRIMER_SPEC` names with the exact spec their deps layer installs — those
recipes are not only parsed but executed, so each has to be named with its spec
rather than discovered. This module pins the shared layer contract they follow
so a fast per-project dev rebuild only re-runs the cheap wheel layer, never the
expensive framework/deps install:

- a **deps layer** (one RUN) that primes the pinned framework release + deps,
  with a dev-gated fallback for an unreleased pin, then installs an optional
  dev-staged ``osprey-local-requirements.txt`` manifest (the local dependency
  delta, COPYed via the guaranteed-sibling idiom) before purging the toolchain,
  and
- a separate **wheel layer** that optionally overlays a locally-built wheel via
  the ``COPY .dockerignore *.wh[l]`` idiom, force-reinstalls it ``--no-deps`` and
  runs ``pip check``,

followed by a metadata-only ``ARG OSPREY_PROJECT_NAME`` / ``LABEL
com.osprey.project`` pair kept last so a per-project value never invalidates the
shared deps cache. Each RUN body is parsed under ``sh -n`` so a shell syntax
error in the conditional install fails here rather than at ``docker build``.

The **whole-file invariants**, over every Dockerfile shipped as a literal file —
all seven services plus the web-terminal auth sidecar, discovered by glob rather
than listed: the proxy-delivery idiom on every apt-using RUN, and a
non-self-excluding ``.dockerignore`` beside every service recipe.
