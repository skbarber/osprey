"""``osprey up`` — starting a deployment repo from ``build/`` as it was built.

Three properties, and everything here serves one of them.

**It never re-renders the services stack.** ``up`` reads ``build/config.yml``
and the compose files a build left beside it. The tests assert that by the
absence of ``prepare_compose_files`` on every path: a start verb that re-rendered
them would make "what is running" unanswerable from the filesystem. The
web-terminal stack is the deliberate exception, and it covers three files: its
compose file, nginx config and landing page are re-rendered at every start
because they follow the user roster rather than the build. Persona projects are
not among them — ``osprey build`` renders one per delta and a start only checks
they are there — so a build wiping ``build/`` is what puts a changed delta into
force.

**It refuses rather than guessing.** A profile edited since the build, a profile
that no longer resolves, a repo with no build at all, a ``.env`` that does not
exist — each is a refusal with a named remedy, and each names only remedies that
are real. ``--build`` and ``--as-built`` are the two documented ways through, and
which of them applies is asserted per state, because they are not
interchangeable: ``--as-built`` cannot start a build that was never made.

**It never prints a secret where a secret should not go.** The mint notice for a
web-terminal password goes to a terminal or nowhere at all.
