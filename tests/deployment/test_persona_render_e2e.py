"""Persona projects, driven against a REAL three-zone build.

Two halves of one promise, and each is an end-to-end property because each
depends on what a build actually writes rather than on what a unit test can
stage.

``osprey build`` renders a persona project per delta in ``personas/``, into the
same ``build/`` it renders the deployment into. ``osprey up`` renders none: it
checks the renders are there and refuses when one is not, naming ``osprey
build``. That split is what keeps ``build/`` a complete account of what a deploy
will run — a start that rendered the missing personas would have stood a fresh
persona beside a deployment rendered from an older profile, which is the one
state an operator cannot see and cannot debug.

The third property is what re-arms the render: a persona delta is source, so
editing one is drift and the drift gate refuses the next start until a rebuild.
Without that fold, a superseded delta would keep shipping into its persona's
image forever, because nothing but a build replaces a render.

These are slow by unit-test standards — every test here builds the exemplar for
real — and that is the point: nothing is stubbed except the clock the operator
would have spent. No container runtime is touched. The renders are
``--skip-deps`` file writes, and image builds are a later step this module never
reaches.
