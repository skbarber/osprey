"""Tests for the target identity the `osprey_approval` hook renders.

Every approval prompt carries one line naming the control-system target the
session is pointed at — `Target: LIVE MACHINE (<endpoint>)`, `Target: virtual
accelerator (simulation)`, or, when the state cannot be resolved, the explicit
`Target: deployment baseline (state unavailable)`. The third spelling is the
whole point of the feature: a prompt with no target line at all reads as "not
the machine", so the line is emitted from `build_approval_output` — the single
funnel every ask goes through — rather than assembled per branch.

The identity comes exclusively from the state file the controls server writes,
never from the rendered config.yml this hook also holds: config states what the
deployment STARTS as, and on a session that switched at run time that would be a
confident, stale, wrong safety claim.

Two levels of test, deliberately:

* in-process, through the `conftest.import_hook` seam, driving the REAL reader
  module (`osprey_target_state`) against real state files in `tmp_path`. Only
  the reader's two documented seams are replaced — `resolve_state_dir` and
  `ancestor_pids` — so "ambiguous" really is two matching live records and
  "unreadable" really is a corrupt file, not a stubbed return value; and
* end to end, running the hook as a subprocess the way Claude Code does, with a
  state file whose `owner_ppid` is this pytest process — genuinely on the hook
  child's ancestor chain — so the parentage resolution, the repo-root anchor and
  the prompt assembly are all exercised for real.
