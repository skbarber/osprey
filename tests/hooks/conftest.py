"""Shared fixtures for hook tests.

Provides a hook runner that executes hook scripts as subprocesses (matching
how Claude Code invokes them), plus config file factories.

Hook subprocesses run with a *curated* environment rather than a copy of
``os.environ``: only the interpreter/OS essentials and the switches the hooks
themselves read are forwarded, so a hook run cannot pick up ``OSPREY_CONFIG``,
``CONFIG_FILE`` or similar state leaked into the process environment by a test
that ran earlier in the same worker.

Unit tests that need a hook's *helpers* rather than its end-to-end behaviour
import the module in-process through :func:`import_hook`, which contains the
first of the two side effects that come with doing so: the ``sys.path`` entry
most hooks insert for their own directory, stripped again on the way out. The
second — ``osprey_hook_log``'s process-wide config memos — outlives any single
import, so an autouse fixture blanks it around every test instead.

    For tests that exercise a hook's helper functions directly; anything that
    depends on hook *behaviour* should go through :func:`hook_runner` instead,
    which runs the script the way Claude Code does.

    ``name`` is the module name, with or without the ``.py`` suffix. Only the
    hooks in :data:`_SEAM_IMPORTABLE_HOOKS` may be imported; asking for one that
    is not on the list raises :class:`ValueError` rather than executing it.

    The import happens here rather than at module scope for two reasons. Most
    hooks prepend their own directory to ``sys.path`` so they can import
    ``osprey_hook_log`` as a sibling — that entry is removed again on the way
    out, since leaving it there lets any later ``import osprey_hook_log``
    anywhere in the worker resolve to the template copy. The strip is
    unconditional, so it is simply a no-op for the few that never add it. And
    the audit in ``tests/infrastructure/test_import_time_audit.py`` forbids
    exactly this kind of import-time mutation in a test module, which is the
    same rule stated as a test.

    The module is cached by :mod:`importlib` for the life of the worker, so every
    call hands back the *same* object and anything written onto it outlives the
    test that wrote it. Mutate a hook module only through ``monkeypatch.setattr``,
    which puts the original back at teardown. The sole state restored for you is
    ``osprey_hook_log``'s three config memos, blanked around every test by the
    :func:`_reset_hook_log_config_caches` autouse fixture.

    ``import_hook("osprey_hook_log")`` carries one trap. It returns the copy under
    :data:`_HOOK_PACKAGE`, which is *not* the top-level ``osprey_hook_log`` that a
    hook binds when its own ``sys.path`` shim imports the sibling. Those are two
    module objects with two sets of globals, so patching the one returned here
    does not change what a hook sees. Exercise logging behaviour that has to cross
    that boundary through :func:`hook_runner`.
