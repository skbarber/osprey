"""The stamp a rendered `channel_write` approval leaves for the controls server.

Approval is enforced out here, in a PreToolUse hook, before the MCP server is
called at all. The server's earliest possible observation of the session's
target is therefore its own tool entry — which is *after* the human clicked, and
a target switch can land while they are still deciding. Nothing the server reads
on its own covers that window.

So the hook writes down the binding it rendered the prompt against, beside the
target state, keyed by the write payload — the only thing that provably crosses
the gap between a hook process and an MCP tool call. The server reads it back and
refuses a write whose approval was granted on a different session.

Two properties matter and are pinned here: the stamp carries the SAME record the
`Target:` line was rendered from (a stamp describing a different read would be a
second opinion about identity), and the key the hook files it under is the key
the server looks it up by (the derivation is stated twice — hooks run outside the
osprey venv — so the two spellings are compared directly).
