"""Tests for the plan-lane awareness of the `osprey_approval` hook.

A deployment that opted into a second Bluesky plan lane runs one whole plan
stack per control-system target, and then two questions the old prompt never had
to answer become safety questions: WHICH lane would this plan be queued on, and
does the lane a start names still serve the target this session is on?

What these tests hold the hook to:

* **a single-lane deployment renders exactly what it always did** — no lane
  line, the same first line, the same bridge. Nearly every deployment is
  single-lane, and a prompt that grew a line there would be a change to the
  safety surface of every project that never asked for lanes. Pinned literally,
  and pinned against a config that has no ``services`` block at all;
* **a two-lane deployment names the lane and its target in the identity voice
  the ``Target:`` line uses** — "virtual accelerator (simulation)" and "LIVE
  MACHINE (<endpoint>)" — because two different phrasings for one machine on one
  prompt is the ambiguity the identity line exists to remove;
* **the detail comes from the addressed lane's own bridge.** Each lane holds its
  own draft and its own queue, so lane 1's answers would describe a different
  machine than the one being approved. Where no lane can be named, nothing is
  listed and the prompt says why;
* **a mismatch is rendered, never approved silently.** A session that switched
  targets between the enqueue and the start would otherwise be shown a queue
  listing with no hint that the start it is approving drives the machine the
  session has just left — and that the deployment will refuse it outright;
* **every gap is explicit.** No state file, no lane serving the session's
  target, a lane whose target the state file records nothing about, a second
  lane with no published port: each has its own line, and none of them is a
  guess or a missing line.

The lane map is read from the rendered config's ``services.<lane>`` blocks —
render-time truth, the same key the host reads — while the session's target
comes only from the state file, driven here through the REAL reader module
against real state files in ``tmp_path``.
