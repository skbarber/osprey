"""What a client sees when it writes a co-hosted setpoint over real Channel Access.

Everything here runs in **one process**: a real ``pcaspy`` server hosting the
real serving database, the real write path deciding what each write means, and
a real ``pyepics`` client driving it from the pytest thread. No subprocess
split, no fake driver -- the assertions are made from the far side of the wire,
which is the only place the properties this file exists to pin are observable
at all. ``tests/va/test_serving_pvdb.py`` and ``tests/va/test_serving_runner.py``
already prove the same contracts in process against a duck-typed driver; this
file is the check that the wire agrees with them.

Two things about the venue are worth stating plainly, because a green run means
nothing without them.

**pcaspy is the venue's hard requirement.** It publishes no macOS arm64 wheel
that this host can load, so on a developer machine the live classes *skip* --
loudly, via ``importorskip``, and a skipped live suite proves nothing. The
venue that proves them is a linux container (and CI's linux lanes); everything
in this file that does not need a server -- the drive-limit derivation, the
collection floor -- runs everywhere and is not gated.

**The client and the server share a process.** ``pcaspy``'s compiled extension
links EPICS statically and globally exports the ``ca_*`` client symbols, so
whichever EPICS stack binds first wins. ``epics.ca.initialize_libca()`` is
therefore called *before* pcaspy is imported, so the client's calls bind to
pyepics' own libca and not to the copy buried in the server extension. That
ordering is the whole reason these can be plain in-process tests.

The run loop is stood in for by :class:`_RunLoop`, which reproduces the one
property of the real loop the write path depends on: the model is touched from
one thread that is never the server's, and the write is completed from there.
