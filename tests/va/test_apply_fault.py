"""The stuck-setpoint apply fault, as a client experiences it.

A stuck setpoint is a build-time fixture: the named address still records what
was written to it, and its paired readback never moves again. The point of the
fault is that it is a property of the *substrate* rather than of one client's
view -- a client that reads back its own command is told the truth about the
command, and every client that reads the device sees the same frozen readback.
That distinction is only observable over a real wire, which is what most of
this file is.

The venue and the in-process topology are the ones
``tests/va/test_record_factory.py`` documents: one process, a real ``pcaspy``
server, a real ``pyepics`` client, and ``epics.ca.initialize_libca()`` before
the pcaspy import so the client binds its own libca rather than the second copy
the server extension exports. pcaspy has no loadable macOS arm64 wheel, so the
live classes skip on a developer host and are proven in a linux container and
on CI; the route-table tests need no server and run everywhere.

The address set here is deliberately disjoint from every other module's, so two
servers alive in one pytest session can never answer for each other's names.
