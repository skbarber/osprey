"""Tests for the co-hosted PV database and its record shims.

Host-side and in-process only: nothing here constructs a Channel Access
server, binds a port or imports the CA server library. The database is plain
data and the shim talks to a duck-typed driver, so both are fully checkable
without a server -- and must stay that way, because this suite runs
concurrently with container work that owns the real CA ports. Live-CA
behaviour (monitor delivery, alarm severity over the wire) is proven in the
container e2e suite instead.
