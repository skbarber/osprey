"""The facility-seam regression gate.

The seam is one sentence: **no accelerator-physics imports on the no-lattice
boot path.** ``VA_LATTICE=none`` describes a facility whose channels a
manifest lists and whose physics this process does not have, and the promise
that makes that mode worth having is that such a facility can boot the
virtual accelerator on a host where the physics stack is not installed at
all. So the guard is drawn around the physics, and only the physics: ``at``
(PyAT itself) and ``lume_pyat`` (the ring model built on it). ``lume_pyat``
has to be named separately because its ``__init__`` is PEP 562 lazy -- an
accidental import costs almost nothing and would not announce itself by
dragging anything heavy in.

``lume`` and ``h5py`` are **deliberately not blocked**, and that is a considered
position rather than a relaxation. The serving layer is built around a
:class:`~lume.model.LUMEModel`: the runner derives its PVA namespace and the
shape of its run loop from one, and the no-lattice boot serves the empty
:class:`~osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.serving.model_stub.NullModel`
rather than no model at all. ``lume`` is therefore a dependency of the
*serving* layer, not of the physics behind it, and blocking it would have
this gate assert something the design does not claim. What the seam
protects is what this boot path is allowed to *depend on* -- not what its
dependencies cost.

It does cost, and the cost is worth naming here rather than discovering
later. Timing a ``VA_LATTICE=none`` boot from process spawn to the ``Loading
simulation engine`` line -- the last milestone both the pre-serving and the
serving entrypoint print, so the interval spans exactly the assembly this
seam governs and none of the transport behind it -- on darwin/arm64,
CPython 3.13, eleven paired runs interleaved between the two trees with one
discarded warm-up each, median of each arm:

    pre-serving entrypoint (no ``lume`` imported)    0.518 s
    serving entrypoint (``lume`` for NullModel)      1.216 s
    delta                                           +0.698 s

Nearly all of it is the single import: ``import lume.model`` alone costs
+0.916 s over a bare interpreter on the same host (median of seven), and the
boot pays less than that only because it shares the numpy that import needs
with code it was already loading. Two thirds of a second is a real number on
a boot whose remaining work is standing up a Channel Access server, and it
is not a regression to chase: it is what serving a LUMEModel costs, and this
mode serves one by design.

Two halves, matching the seam's two promises:

* **The historical path is unchanged.** With none of the source env vars
  set, the entrypoint resolves to exactly the pre-seam behaviour: built-in
  generated manifest, PyAT lattice, bundled drive-limit/boot-value data.
  (The deep guarantee is the rest of ``tests/va`` -- every pre-seam test
  still runs against the default path -- so this half only pins the
  resolution itself.)

* **A file-backed facility boots without PyAT.** A manifest of three-part
  addresses (identity carried in the hierarchy keys, not the address text)
  boots the *real* ``entrypoint.main()`` in a subprocess whose import
  machinery makes any ``import at`` fatal. A change that sneaks a physics
  dependency onto the no-lattice path turns that boot into a crash, and this
  test red.

The boot runs in a subprocess of its own because ``main()`` is a process
entry point in the literal sense: it installs SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers, binds
a Channel Access port and then blocks in the runner's loop until signalled.
None of that belongs in pytest's process.

**How far the boot gets depends on the host.** ``serving.runner`` imports the
Channel Access server extension, and a host without it cannot reach the
serving announcement no matter how clean the seam is. So the assertions are
split by what each proves: the seam itself and the whole no-lattice assembly
ahead of the transport are checked unconditionally, and the terminal outcome
is required to be either the serving announcement or a missing *server*
module -- never a physics one, and never anything else. On a host with the
extension this test proves the boot end to end; on one without it, it still
proves everything the seam is about.

Both outcomes have been exercised, so neither is a branch written on faith.
A host carrying none of the server extensions stops at the runner import,
which is the second outcome. In a linux/amd64 container carrying pcaspy,
p4p and the PVA serving package, the same ``main()`` runs to ``virtual
accelerator IOC serving PVs: 4 channels`` with the physics blocked -- so the
seam is known to hold across a complete boot, not merely across the part of
one a development host can reach.
