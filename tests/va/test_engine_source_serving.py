"""``EngineSource`` driven against the real serving-layer record shim.

The 1 Hz telemetry source was written against pythonSoftIOC In-type records.
The serving layer replaces those with :class:`~osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.serving.pvdb.PVRecord`,
and the claim under test is that the swap is invisible to ``EngineSource``:
it drives records through exactly ``record.set(value)`` and ``record.get()``,
both of which the shim provides.

Every test here therefore uses the **real** ``build_serving_pvdb()`` output --
a mock of the shim would only prove that ``EngineSource`` works against a
mock. What *is* faked is the layer below the shim: the Channel Access driver
(``setParam``/``getParam``/``updatePV``), so this suite stays host-side and
in-process. Nothing here constructs a CA server, binds a port or imports the
CA server library; live-CA behaviour belongs to the container e2e suite.

The four behaviours proven are the ones that must survive the swap:

* the poll tick drives co-hosted telemetry PVs and posts a monitor event per
  address;
* scenario hot-reload (mtime + content-hash detection) still fires;
* setpoint-echo sync reads **through the driver**, so a setpoint a client
  wrote over CA reaches the engine -- a shim that cached values locally would
  feed the engine a stale one;
* one record's failure never kills the poll loop. That last one is a safety
  property: the loop is scheduled as a fire-and-forget coroutine whose result
  nobody retrieves, so an escaping exception would freeze every telemetry
  channel at its boot value with no visible error.
