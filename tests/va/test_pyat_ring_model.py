"""Tests for the virtual accelerator's LUME model layer.

The headline counts below are pinned as literals on purpose: 348 magnet
setpoints plus 144 BPM readings is the contract the model exposes, and a
silent drift in either number is exactly what this suite exists to catch.
Everything else is derived from the same sources the catalog reads.

The ``PyATRingModel`` half of the suite targets the real ALS-U AR ring, so
every "away from nominal" current here is a fraction of the device's own
``machine.json`` nominal rather than an absolute number, and device counts
come from ``osprey.simulation.facility_spec.ALS_U_AR`` -- the databases fix
the model, not vice versa.
