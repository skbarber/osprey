"""Cross-check: the ORM measured by driving `PhysicsBridge` against the
independent `lattice/response.py` model oracle (task 5.1).

Two physics code paths that never call each other are compared here:
`PhysicsBridge` (the live IOC-facing setpoint -> orbit -> BPM-reading path,
including the seeded-error read pipeline `bind()`/`_push_bpm_readbacks` wires
up) and `lattice.response.orbit_response` (an offline, from-scratch model of
the same corrector-kick -> closed-orbit response, built and cached
independently in `response.py`'s own module-global ring). Building a
response-slope matrix from each and comparing them proves the live bridge's
physics matches the model, not merely that each is internally consistent.

Corrector and BPM device ids are derived from the manifest's pyat-coupled
inventory (`lattice.inventory`), never hardcoded preset channel names, per
the epic's VA-safety-test convention.

The model side (`_model_matrix`) evaluates `orbit_response` over the SAME
5-point sweep and fits it with the SAME degree-1 `numpy.polyfit` that
`orm_analysis.build_response_matrix` fits over the measured rows -- estimator
identity, not just independent data sources. On the real AR lattice's
nonlinear (sextupole-bearing) closed-orbit response, a two-point
finite-difference slope and a 5-point polyfit slope over the same sweep are
different numbers, so anything less than an identical estimator on both
sides would make the <=1e-9 agreement below meaningless; see `test_lattice.py`
and `calibration.py`'s `AMPS_PER_RADIAN_KICK` comment for why the ring is
nonlinear enough for this to matter.
