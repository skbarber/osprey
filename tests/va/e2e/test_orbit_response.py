"""SC3 acceptance: a real SR corrector write moves a real downstream BPM,
through the real connector, against the real container.

Uses device 01 (``SR:MAG:HCM:01`` <-> ``SR:DIAG:BPM:01``) -- no other test in
this suite touches device 01's correctors, so its lattice state is exclusively
owned here for the life of the session container.

The physics bridge (osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.ioc.physics_bridge) applies
a linear kick-angle map and AT's find_orbit4 closed-orbit solve on the real
ALS-U AR ring; sextupoles sit at their baked strengths, so the response is
linear to feed-down accuracy (relative deviation well inside LINEAR_REL_TOL
at these amplitudes) and antisymmetric about zero current, not merely "moves
in the same direction as the raw local kick" (that naive assumption is wrong
for a periodic ring; see findings #8). This asserts the antisymmetric-linear
shape directly: +I and -I give opposite shifts, 2x I doubles the shift, and
the shift is nonzero at the paired BPM -- never same-sign or magnitude alone.

Sweep currents stay inside the committed +/-12 A corrector band: the records
layer enforces channel_limits.json bands as DRVL/DRVH, so an out-of-band
write (e.g. 20 A) is silently clamped at the record and would corrupt the
linearity measurement rather than fail loudly.
