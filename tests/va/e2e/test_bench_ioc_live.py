"""The target switch against a real machine, not a second simulator.

``test_target_switch.py`` proves the switch's *mechanics* — processes, drains,
generations — by pointing both targets at the same virtual-accelerator image.
That is the honest way to test a supervisor, and it is deliberately not what
this module does. Here the two ends are different *kinds* of Channel Access
server: the deployment's ``va`` target is the virtual accelerator, and its
``live`` target is a stock EPICS ``softIoc`` (``docker/bench-ioc/``) holding
seeded constants, an access-security file that refuses one write, and a handful
of records the virtual accelerator's manifest has never heard of.

The invariant this module exists to pin: **a session pointed at the live target
is talking to the live machine, and everything that follows from that machine's
own behaviour reaches the operator unchanged.** Not "a switch was reported" —
every claim below is settled by something only the bench IOC can produce:

* a shared channel that reads ``7.25`` here and something else there;
* a ``caput`` the *IOC* denies (its ASG withholds WRITE), arriving as
  ``outcome == refused`` with ``refusal_reason="CONTROL_SYSTEM_REFUSED"`` — which
  is a different claim from the reference monitor's own limits refusal, and is
  asserted to be distinguishable from it;
* records that exist on one target and not the other, in both directions;
* record textures a simulator does not have to reproduce: an ``mbbi`` reporting
  its index unconverted, a ``calc`` reporting its derived value, and a readback
  driven past its ``HIHI`` threshold reporting the alarm by name;
* the machine going away mid-session, and the session saying so.

The deployment's baseline is the virtual accelerator (``control_system.type:
virtual_accelerator``), which is what makes the live gate testable at all: FR-8
waives the operator acknowledgment for a session *returning* to its baseline, so
a live-baseline deployment could never show the acknowledgment doing anything.
Here every switch to ``live`` is a switch *toward* the real machine and is
judged as one.

Process boundaries, restated because they are load-bearing
----------------------------------------------------------
This pytest process never becomes a Channel Access client. Reads and writes go
through real ``python -m osprey_connectors.ipc.host`` children, exactly as a
deployment's do — which is also why the refusal above can be asserted at all:
``tests/fixtures/bench_ioc.py``'s convenience ``caput`` collapses its result to
four scalars, and ``refusal_reason`` is not among them. The structured
``ChannelWriteResult`` only exists on the connector path, so the connector path
is what these tests drive. Container lifecycle and the seeded constants come
from that fixture module; nothing about the record set is restated here.
