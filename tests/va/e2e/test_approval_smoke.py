"""FR5 acceptance: VA inherits the same base-class write-safety wiring as
EPICS/mock -- ``VirtualAcceleratorConnector`` is an unmodified
``EPICSConnector`` subclass, so ``control_system.writes_enabled: false``
must hard-block writes at the connector guard with zero CA I/O, exactly as
``tests/connectors/test_writes_enabled.py`` proves for the base class in
isolation. This test proves the same contract against a real container: the
blocked write never reaches the IOC (read-back over CA confirms no change),
and the *same* channel accepts the write once writes are enabled -- so the
blocking is demonstrably the guard, not something else broken.

The mandatory-approval hook path itself (the agent's PreToolUse hook chain)
is connector-agnostic -- it gates on the detected write pattern, not on
``control_system.type`` -- and is already covered by
``tests/hooks/test_approval_hook.py`` and friends; nothing about VA changes
that layer, so it isn't re-tested here.

Uses device 03 (``SR:MAG:HCM:03``) -- devices 01/02 are exclusively owned by
test_orbit_response.py / test_limits_enforcement.py for the life of the
session container.
