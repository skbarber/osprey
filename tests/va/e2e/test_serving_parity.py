"""Does the wire agree with the namespace the virtual accelerator meant to serve?

Four kinds of agreement, each checked against a real container over a real
Channel Access wire, because each is a claim about what a *client* observes and
none of them is decidable from inside the serving process:

* **monitor delivery** -- a readback event follows a setpoint write, and
  telemetry arrives with no client write at all. A one-shot read cannot tell a
  value that was posted from one that was merely recorded, so the settle-wait
  every scan depends on is only observable through a subscription.
* **record-type parity** -- the type and element count on the wire are the ones
  the manifest's ``record_type`` column asked for. Expected values are derived
  from the manifest here rather than written down, so this is a comparison of
  two independent descriptions of the same namespace.
* **alarm parity** -- a write clamped to the top of its drive band reads back
  ``NO_ALARM``. Clamping is a normal outcome; the served database declares no
  alarm limits precisely so that a clamped value does not present as a fault.
* **seeded-readout divergence** -- a BPM's served reading is its true orbit
  position put through ``bpm_read``, not the truth itself.

**Two containers, and why.** The divergence check needs the truth a reading
diverges *from*, and no transport carries it: both Channel Access and PVAccess
serve the reading. So truth is measured rather than derived -- a second boot of
the same image with no seeded error, where ``bpm_read`` is the identity and the
served reading therefore *is* the true position. Both boots are driven to the
same machine state by the same single corrector write before either is
sampled, and the unseeded control BPM is required to agree between them to
within nothing at all; if it does not, the comparison is void and this suite
says so instead of reporting a difference it cannot attribute.

**Every Channel Access operation runs in a subprocess.** Two independent
reasons, both load-bearing. libca latches ``EPICS_CA_*`` when the C library
initialises, and this directory's session container (``conftest.py``) publishes
on a different port than the containers here do, so one process cannot be a
client of both. And the connector wraps synchronous pyepics in a thread-pool
executor whose CA context is per-thread, so a main-thread pyepics call in this
process deadlocks any connector-based test sharing it. The worker below is
dispatched before this module imports anything heavy and speaks JSON on stdout.

**Ports, and container names.** Each container binds an ephemeral port and
publishes it unchanged: a Channel Access search reply carries the server's own
port number, so a remap would hand every client an address nothing answers on.
Nothing here goes near 5064, which belongs to whatever the operator is running.
That port also *names* the container, appended to the prefixes below. A fixed
name would be mutually destructive: each boot force-removes its name first, as
stale-cleanup from a crashed prior run, and against a concurrent peer that is
not cleanup -- it kills a live run mid-test, which then fails with a boot
timeout or a dropped connection that reads as environmental rather than as a
collision, and so gets misdiagnosed. The port is already unique per run, so it
is the suffix; the prefix stays recognisable to a human reading ``docker ps``.
