"""SC6 acceptance: every address a channel-finder pipeline surfaces is live over CA.

The Control Assistant preset ships the SAME full manifest namespace -- a few
thousand addresses; ``channel_manifest.json``'s ``_metadata.total_channels``
is the authoritative count -- in three interchangeable channel-finder paradigms
(``osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.manifest``'s own build step
cross-checks this: ``build_manifest()`` raises ``ParadigmMismatchError`` if
the three tier-3 DBs ever disagree on their expanded address set -- see
``manifest/build.py``). This suite proves that
guarantee holds against a *live* container by expanding each paradigm DB
through its own loader (the same loaders ``manifest/build.py`` uses, so this
exercises the real per-pipeline expansion path rather than re-deriving
addresses from one shared source) and reading a representative slice of
finder-surfaced addresses -- orbit, corrector, RF, vacuum -- back over real
Channel Access.

Reuses ``scripts/va/sweep_check.sweep()`` for the actual batched CA read (same
reachability-sweep logic ``test_full_sweep.py`` already validates at full
manifest scale), so this test is about *which* addresses each pipeline hands
back, not a new CA-read mechanism.
