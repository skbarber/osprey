"""Shared fixtures for the Virtual Accelerator live-container e2e suite.

Every test in this directory needs a real ``osprey-va-full`` container
actually serving Channel Access -- these are integration tests against a
live soft-IOC, not unit tests, and are opt-in via ``OSPREY_VA_E2E_ENABLE=1``
(unset, the whole directory collects cleanly and every test skips).

Container lifecycle: ONE session-scoped container per pytest process, named
``osprey-va-e2e-<pid>`` and never anything else (the containment rules in the
run notes apply to that exact name), shared by every test in this directory;
they run serially in one pytest process, so there's no port contention. The
pid suffix is what keeps two concurrent runs from destroying each other: this
fixture force-removes its container by name on the way in, as stale-cleanup
from a crashed prior run, and against a *live* peer sharing one fixed name
that is not cleanup -- it kills the peer mid-test, which then fails with a
boot timeout or a dropped connection that reads as environmental rather than
as a collision. The ``osprey-va-e2e`` prefix is kept so a stray container is
still recognisable by eye. It's bind-mounted against a *scratch* copy of the
Control Assistant preset's ``data/simulation`` directory (never the repo's
own copy -- ``osprey sim apply`` mutates ``active_scenarios`` and this suite
adds its own synthetic scenario), so the fixture is free to write into it.

Process-boundary note (mirrors ``tests/va/test_record_factory.py``): this
conftest and every test module in this directory may import ``epics``
(pyepics, a CA *client*) and the softioc-free
``osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.manifest`` package, but must NEVER
import ``ioc.records`` or ``softioc.builder`` -- doing so in-process
permanently breaks this process's ability to act as a CA client (see that
module's docstring for the empirical finding). The IOC itself only ever runs
inside the container, in its own process.

``sweep_check`` (below) is loaded here, once, from its file path -- it's a
script under ``scripts/va/``, not an importable dotted package -- so
test_full_sweep.py and test_finder_live_reads.py can both import it from this
conftest instead of each re-doing the ``importlib.util`` load.
