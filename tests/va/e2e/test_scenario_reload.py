"""SC8 acceptance: ``osprey sim apply`` reaches the live container and the
IOC's poll-driven reload picks up the new scenario within its documented
bound.

A note on scope, established by reading the actual container wiring (not
assumed): the literal task language describes writing a VAC/RF channel via
``channel_write`` and then observing that write "reset" by a scenario switch.
That specific mechanism doesn't exist for VAC telemetry as built --
``osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.manifest.classify`` puts read-only VAC/RF
telemetry (gauges, temperatures, ion-pump current) in the ``static-noisy``
partition, which ``ioc/records.py`` builds as plain CA *In*-type records --
there is no Out record to ``channel_write`` in the first place, so nothing
written there can be "reset" by a later apply. The only VAC/RF fields that
are genuinely writable over CA (``ion-pump VOLTAGE``, RF ``VOLTAGE``/
``FREQUENCY``/``TUNER``) are classified ``sp-echo`` -- wired to their
readback by a plain value copy in ``ioc/records.py``, with no tie to
``SimulationEngine`` at all, so they are *not* reset by a scenario switch
either (confirmed below, as a real regression check, not an assumption).

What the built system actually does, and what this test verifies instead:
``ioc/engine_source.py`` polls ``active_scenarios`` (1s interval) and drives
every *static-noisy* channel from ``SimulationEngine.read()``, which composes
whichever scenario's ``overrides`` are currently active. None of the shipped
example scenarios (nominal/rf-thermal/vacuum-burst) carry an ``overrides``
block -- only archiver history events -- so this test's ``conftest.py`` adds
a synthetic ``va-e2e-burst`` scenario with a real override to exercise the
reload path end-to-end: apply it, observe the override live over CA within
the poll bound, apply ``nominal`` again, and observe the value reset back to
baseline.
