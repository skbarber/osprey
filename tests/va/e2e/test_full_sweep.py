"""SC4 acceptance: the complete namespace-union manifest is live over CA.

Batched bulk reads (one shared connect deadline, never a per-channel serial
loop -- see ``scripts/va/sweep_check.py``) of every address the manifest
defines, against the real running container. Hard wall-clock bound: the full
sweep must finish in under 60s, and zero addresses may fail to connect or
return a value.
