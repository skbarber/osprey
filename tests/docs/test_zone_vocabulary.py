"""Vocabulary gate: the deployment repo has FOUR zones, not three.

SOURCE, SECRETS, OUTPUT and STATE — the redesign that gave OUTPUT its own zone
retired every "three-zone" description of the layout. "four zones" is now the
only bare zone count that may appear in shipped text; the sole surviving use of
the old count is the exact phrase "three ignored zones" (three of the four
zones are git-ignored, one — SOURCE — is not), which no shipped line currently
needs but which the pattern below deliberately does not flag.

The sweep scans whitespace-collapsed text rather than raw lines, because a
wrapped docstring or comment can carry "three" and "zone(s)" on different
physical lines with words in between — `` and the three\\n# generated or
secret zones below`` reads as one "three ... zones" phrase despite the line
break, and a line-anchored grep would miss it.

The sweep covers ``src/osprey/`` and ``docs/source/``, matching the shape of
the other ``tests/docs/`` removal gates (see ``test_deploy_ops_retired.py`` and
``test_env_production_retired.py``). ``tests/`` itself is out of scope: plenty
of test code still narrates fixtures and helpers as "three-zone" (variable and
function names, docstrings) and rewriting all of it is a separate concern from
guarding the shipped vocabulary an operator or facility reader actually sees.
