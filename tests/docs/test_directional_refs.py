"""Suite for the docs directional-reference guard.

The guard exists because splitting a page turns "as described below" into a
promise the page can no longer keep. A guard nobody has watched fail proves
nothing, so the synthetic pages here pair one real offence with the lookalikes
that have to stay quiet — a "below" pointing into this very page, a numeric
comparison, an inline literal, a word inside a literal block, and a word one
paragraph away — plus the two blind spots review found: a literal block opened
inside a list item, and a Markdown page the guard cannot read.
