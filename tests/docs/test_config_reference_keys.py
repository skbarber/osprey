"""Every config key the reference section documents must really exist.

``docs/source/reference/configuration/`` is the operator-facing catalogue of
``config.yml`` settings. A key that appears there and nowhere in the shipped
code is worse than an undocumented one: the reader copies it into their own
config, nothing happens, and there is no error to tell them why. The reverse
drift is just as quiet — a key gets renamed or retired in the code, the guard
manifest records that, and the reference page keeps advertising the old
spelling forever.

This sweep closes that gap by cross-checking the two artefacts that already
exist for their own reasons:

* the reference pages, where a documented key is written as an RST inline
  literal — ``web.theme``, ``services.postgresql.port`` — and
* ``scripts/config_key_manifest.yml``, the config-key resurrection guard's
  ledger, whose top-level ``keys:`` mapping is the authoritative list of every
  dotted path the shipped templates render and the code reads. That manifest is
  independently enforced against the source tree by
  ``scripts/check_config_keys.py``, so "declared there" is a claim with teeth
  rather than a second list to keep in sync by hand.

A key listed under the manifest's ``deleted:`` section counts as undeclared —
that section exists precisely to record spellings that must not come back, and
documenting one is the resurrection the guard is named after.

Scope is deliberately narrow. Only inline literals whose whole content is a
dotted path rooted at one of the known top-level config sections are checked,
so ordinary prose, file paths, CLI verbs, environment variables and YAML
snippets in code blocks pass by untouched. The directory is allowed not to
exist yet: the reference section is being built out, and a sweep that hard
-failed on an absent tree would block its own scaffolding.

#: ``facility`` earns its place the moment the reference page documents a

#: pattern below anchors a literal dot after the section name, so the entry
#: cannot swallow ``facility_knowledge.*`` or the retired ``facility_name``.
#:

#: documents ``deployment.port_base`` — the one knob that moves a deployment's
