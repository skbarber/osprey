"""Removal gate: the ``osprey-deploy-ops`` skill is gone, with no successor name.

Operating a deployment is the lifecycle commands themselves — ``osprey up``,
``osprey status``, ``osprey logs``, ``osprey health``, ``osprey down`` — not a
separate installable runbook. The skill was removed outright, so no shipped
source or documentation page may still tell someone to install it.

The sweep covers ``src/osprey/`` (including the bundled skills and app README
templates, which are shipped instructions) and ``docs/source/``. ``CHANGELOG.md``
is out of scope by design — it records the removal and the historical entries
that introduced the skill, and rewriting released history to satisfy a grep would
be worse than the grep failing.
