"""The base seed: what it writes, what it promises, and what a reader gets back.

Three questions decide whether a deployment's archive is honest, and this file
answers each against something other than the seeder's own opinion:

* **Does the store hold what a query would compute?** The roundtrip tests seed a
  real MongoDB and read it back through ``MongoDBArchiverConnector`` — the same
  connector a deployed agent uses — and compare against the generators directly.
  A seeder that agreed only with itself would pass a mock and fail a deployment.

* **Does history age like history?** The two tiers carry different lifetimes,
  stamped per document from the sample's own time. The expiry tests check the
  stamps rather than waiting on MongoDB's TTL sweeper, which runs on its own
  minute-scale schedule; the sweeper's own behaviour is the retention contract
  test's subject, not this file's.

* **Is a reseed a decision?** The fingerprint tests pin what does and does not
  provoke one. The seed instant is the interesting case: it moves on every
  deploy, so counting it would make every deploy rebuild the store, and
  *forgetting* to exclude it is a mistake nothing else would catch.

Container-backed tests skip cleanly without Docker. The grid, synthesis and
fingerprint tests need no container and carry the contract on their own.
