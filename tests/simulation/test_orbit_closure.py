"""Closed-orbit finding sanity checks for the 4D canonical ALS-U AR ring.

This is throwaway physics insurance: it locks down that ``at.find_orbit4``
actually converges on the shared ring topology (not a given for a hand-ported
lattice) and that a single corrector kick produces a bounded, sign-odd orbit
response, before later phases build orbit-response-matrix plans on top
of it.

Elements are selected by pyAT element TYPE (``at.Corrector``, ``at.Monitor``),
never by ``FamName`` string, so this file stays valid across the concurrent
FamName-rename work happening elsewhere in this phase -- orbit-finding is a
topology property, not a naming one.
