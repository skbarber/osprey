"""Type-aware simulation-file lookup for `osprey sim apply`/`list`/`status`.

Before this fix, both ``apply_scenarios`` (simulation/apply.py) and the ``sim``
CLI's ``_load_project_engine`` (cli/sim.py) resolved the simulation-model file
exclusively from ``control_system.connector.mock.simulation_file`` and hard-
raised otherwise. In VA mode (``control_system.type: virtual_accelerator``)
that breaks the write->apply->read flow: the VA connector's simulation_file
lives under ``connector.virtual_accelerator.simulation_file`` instead.

``osprey.simulation.apply.resolve_simulation_file`` is the single shared
resolver both call sites now use. This file pins:

- mock resolution and its missing-key error text are bit-identical to the
  pre-VA behavior (both in the helper and in each of its two callers, which
  keep their own historical wording for the mock case).
- VA resolution reads ``connector.virtual_accelerator.simulation_file``, and
  falls back to the mock key when its own key is unset (mirroring the
  contract that "the mock fallback" is a real, not just informational, key).
- an unknown/unsupported ``control_system.type`` fails cleanly, naming both
  the type-specific key and the mock fallback key that were tried.
