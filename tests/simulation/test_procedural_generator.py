"""The procedural generator's contract: absolute time, VA baselines, bounded.

``osprey.simulation.procedural`` synthesizes history for the channels a
project's ``machine.json`` does not describe — 1,872 of the control-assistant
preset's 2,908 — and its output is written into a real store as well as
returned from live archiver queries. That makes three things load-bearing, and
this file locks each of them:

* **Window independence.** Values are a pure function of ``(channel, epoch
  seconds)``. Two overlapping queries must agree on every timestamp they share,
  and a document seeded at time T must equal what a later query synthesizes for
  T — otherwise materializing the series produces history that contradicts the
  next read. The predecessor generator was a function of the query's *shape*
  (an ``np.linspace(0, 1, n)`` axis) and satisfied neither.

* **Baseline anchoring.** The baseline is whatever the Virtual Accelerator
  boots the channel at, drawn from the same two sources the VA itself uses.
  The per-partition test below reads the shipped channel manifest and machine
  model and checks the generator against the VA's own serving layer, so a
  divergence between the two worlds fails here rather than as a phantom step in
  a deployed archive.

* **A bounded, noise-scaled envelope.** Seeded history and recorded reality
  meet at a seam; the step across it has to be attributable to noise, not read
  as an event. ``deviation_bound`` states the envelope and the shape terms are
  structurally inside it.

    a fabricated dynamic. So the shape is not visible sample to sample and a
