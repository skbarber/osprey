"""The graph MCP tools against a real Neo4j 5.26 + neosemantics store.

Every other graph test mocks the driver.  That proves the call shapes and the
envelope wiring, but it cannot prove the four things this feature actually
rests on:

* that ``Session.execute_read`` really refuses a write, and really refuses it
  with the status code :class:`~osprey.mcp_server.graph.server_context.GraphReadOnlyViolation`
  keys off — a mocked driver can only assert we *believe* it does;
* that the gate's refuse/pass matrix lines up with what the server would have
  done, i.e. that everything it passes is valid Cypher a read transaction
  accepts, and everything it refuses never reaches the wire;
* that the curated examples in
  :mod:`osprey.mcp_server.graph.tools.examples_data` are runnable Cypher which
  reproduces, on the shipped demo corpus, the verified counts — and returns
  rows with the parameter values shipped beside them;
* that the row cap and the query timeout are enforced by the *store* rather
  than by a client-side slice.

One store, seeded once per module with ``demo_machine.ttl`` (generated from
the control_assistant channel database) through the same primitives
``osprey knowledge seed-graph`` uses.

Skips are loud and only ever about the host.  If Docker is not reachable the
whole module skips with that reason; if Docker *is* reachable every test here
runs, because a graph test that quietly passes without a graph is worse than
no test at all.

The container recipe — pinned n10s jar bind-mounted at ``/plugins`` instead of
``NEO4J_PLUGINS``, APOC copied out of the image — is the shared one in
``tests/_graphdb_container.py``; see that module's docstring for why
``NEO4J_PLUGINS`` is deliberately unset.
