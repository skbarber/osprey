"""Two control systems that can be told apart by what they read back.

The mock-pair integration suite needs a deployment with *two servable targets*
and no EPICS anywhere: a switch that moves nothing observable proves nothing,
so both targets have to answer the same channel with different numbers. That is
the whole job of this module.

``live`` reaches :class:`LiveConnector` by dotted path — ``resolve_target``
returns ``control_system.type`` verbatim, so naming the class there makes it a
real, servable live target — and ``va`` reaches :class:`VaConnector` through the
registry name ``virtual_accelerator``, which a scratch ``sitecustomize`` on the
child's ``PYTHONPATH`` registers before ``register_builtin_connectors()`` runs
(that function never replaces an existing registration). Neither class imports a
control-system client library, so a child running either one touches no gateway.

What each connector serves
--------------------------
Every value is a constant derived from the connector's own :attr:`seed`, never
randomised: an assertion about *which* process answered has to be an assertion
about an exact number.

* :data:`SHARED_CHANNEL` — served by both, answering the seed itself. Reading it
  before and after a switch is the routing claim.
* :data:`BATCH_CHANNELS` — served by both, one distinct value each, for the
  batched-read round-trip count.
* A probe channel per target (:data:`LIVE_PROBE`, :data:`VA_PROBE`), served
  *only* by the connector it belongs to. Reading the other target's probe
  channel therefore fails, which is the routing claim stated negatively.
* :data:`SLOW_CHANNEL` — blocks far longer than any deadline the suite uses, so
  a read can be caught in flight and the child killed underneath it.
* :data:`LIMITS_CHANNEL` — writing it raises a fully populated
  :class:`~osprey_connectors.errors.ChannelLimitsViolationError`. Every field is
  set, including ``max_step`` and ``current_value``, which no naturally
  occurring violation populates without a readback; a field that crossed the
  process boundary as another field's value is then visible as a failure rather
  than hidden behind a default.

Writes reach that raise only on a deployment whose config says
``control_system.writes_enabled: true`` — the base class's guard returns a
blocked *result* otherwise and this module's ``write_channel`` is never entered.
