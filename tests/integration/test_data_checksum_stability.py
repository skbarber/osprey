"""``data/`` is byte-stable across every runtime writer (FR-8b regression).

A project's ``data/`` tree is build-owned: rendered from the profile, checksummed
into ``.osprey-manifest.json``, and cleared by ``osprey build``. Anything
written there while the system runs therefore reads as project drift and is
erased by the next forced rebuild — silently taking an operator's scenario
selection or accumulated channel-finder feedback with it.

Unit tests pin each writer's own target directory. This one pins the property
that matters across all of them at once: build a real project, run every known
runtime writer against it, and assert :func:`calculate_file_checksums` reports
byte-identical ``data/`` entries afterwards. A new runtime writer that defaults
into ``data/`` fails here even if nobody thought to write it its own test.

Each test also asserts its writer actually wrote something under the agent-data
root — an assertion that nothing changed is worthless if the writer no-opped.
