"""Cross-cutting integration tests for dispatch input files.

These pin the guarantees that span the worker and the dispatcher together and so
belong to neither single unit's test module:

1. **Combined-cap arithmetic** — the caller-file cap, the follow-up re-injection
   cap, and a folded-history budget are sized so a worst-case request body still
   fits the 32 MB request-body limit with roughly a quarter to spare. A change to
   any one constant that eroded that headroom is caught here. Both sides are
   imported — the bridge budgets from ``osprey.bridges.core.pipeline``, the worker
   caps from ``input_files_policy`` — so this catches either side moving alone.
2. **No base64 payload leak, end to end** — a file's ``content_b64`` bytes ride
   only an image content block; they must never reach the assembled prompt text,
   the persisted run record, the dispatcher's recorded history, or any log sink.
3. **Version skew** — a request carrying ``input_files`` against a model that
   predates the field is silently dropped, not rejected. This is why a bridge
   must gate the feature on the ``/health`` capability rather than assume the
   worker consumed the batch.
4. **Fatal-4xx error_code propagation** — a worker 400 with a machine-readable
   ``detail`` travels webhook -> worker_client ``WorkerRejectedRequestError`` -> pool
   record -> the dispatcher's ``/dispatch/{id}`` poll body as a top-level error
   carrying the same ``error_code``.

Hermetic: FastAPI/Starlette ``TestClient`` and direct calls, fake ``query`` and
``dispatch_to_worker`` stand-ins, tmp-rooted artifact stores — no network, no
real SDK, no real worker.
