"""End-to-end coverage of the graph store against a real Neo4j + neosemantics.

This is the only place the seeding primitives in
:mod:`osprey.services.facility_knowledge.seeder.graph_seeder` meet an actual
n10s plugin.  Every other graphdb test mocks the driver, which can prove the
call shapes but not the two things that decide whether the feature works: that
``n10s.graphconfig.init`` with :data:`~...graph_seeder.N10S_GRAPH_CONFIG`
produces a graph the operator queries can traverse, and that the shipped
``demo_machine.ttl`` imports into exactly the corpus those queries were verified
against.  So the assertions here are the four counts verified on the generated
demo machine (512 devices / 2908 bindings / 396 write-only + 2512 read-only /
382 magnets rolled up through the class hierarchy), plus n10s's own
``terminationStatus`` and its 36624 triples.

Counts only, never wall clock: seeding time depends on the host's disk and on
whether the image was cold, and a timing assertion here would fail on a loaded
CI runner while proving nothing about the graph.

The container recipe — the pinned image, the n10s jar (from the pinned release
or from ``OSPREY_TEST_N10S_JAR``), the APOC jar copied out of the image, and the
procedure allowlist that replaces ``NEO4J_PLUGINS`` — lives in
:mod:`tests._graphdb_container`, which every graph lane shares.  Without Docker,
without the image, or without the jar this module skips and says which.
