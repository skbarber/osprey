"""The profile-is-the-source-of-truth roundtrip, driven through the real CLI.

This is the executable contract for the feature's cross-cutting requirement:

    After ``init`` -> ``build`` -> edit the source zone -> ``build``, the render
    reflects EVERY edit and holds no facility-authored state the source cannot
    regenerate.

Everything else here exists to make that sentence checkable end to end, so the
suite is organized as one scripted roundtrip plus the semantics that hang off
it:

1. **Every edit reaches the render** (the :func:`roundtrip` fixture and
   :class:`TestEveryEditReachesTheProject`) — ``osprey init`` a deployment repo,
   build it, then edit one artifact in *every* convention category plus
   ``triggers.yml``, a persona delta, and the repo ``.env``; rebuild and assert
   each edit landed, and that the rebuild never wrote back into the source.
2. **Nothing unregenerable accumulates** (:class:`TestNoUnregenerableFacilityState`)
   — the render carries no secrets surface at all, the mirror refuses a
   build-owned path, and deleting ``build/`` outright loses nothing the source
   zone owns. The render carries no ``.env`` at all, so there is no merge of the
   profile's ``.env`` into a copy inside the render and no rules governing one;
   that contract is asserted directly, as the *absence* of a secrets surface.
3. **The persona stack** — a ``personas/<name>.yml`` delta anchored at its root,
   its exclusions (list artifact, convention artifact, and a convention artifact
   shadowing a framework render, which the exclusion restores), its inherited
   secrets, root-edit staleness, and the ways a persona reference fails.
4. **Standalone builds** — a directory holding one ``profile.yml`` IS a
   deployment repo: it renders into its own ``build/`` and materializes nothing
   beside itself.

Cost control: ``osprey build`` is the slow step, so the scripted roundtrip runs
once per module (``--skip-deps --skip-lifecycle``, which keeps it network-free)
and the read-only assertions share it. Tests that mutate take a copy.

Environment: ``osprey init`` seeds the repo ``.env`` from the shell's exported
provider keys, so every invocation here runs under
:func:`_sanitized_provider_env` — the developer's real keys must not reach a
fixture, and the sentinel value below is what the assertions track through the
pipeline.
