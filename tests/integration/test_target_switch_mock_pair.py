"""The runtime target switch, end to end, on a pair of mock control systems.

The unit suites each pin one layer: the supervisor's process lifecycle
(``tests/mcp_server/test_switch_lifecycle.py``), the typed error frame
(``tests/mcp_server/test_error_envelope_ipc.py``), the executor's stamp
(``tests/runtime/test_executor_target_stamp.py``). What none of them can claim
is that the layers *compose* — that a tool call made through the real server
context lands on the process the switch just adopted, that a batch stays a
batch on the way there, and that a child dying underneath a call is refused
rather than papered over.

That is what this file is for, and every test in it drives the full parent side:
the real :class:`ControlSystemContext` on a switch-capable config, the real
``ConnectorHostManager``, real ``python -m osprey_connectors.ipc.host``
children, and the real MCP tools where a tool is the thing under test.

Two targets, no containers and no EPICS
---------------------------------------
The "two endpoints" are two mock connectors that answer the same channel with
different numbers (:mod:`tests.integration._mock_pair_connectors`). ``live``
names one of them by dotted path — ``resolve_target`` returns
``control_system.type`` verbatim — and ``va`` gets the other through a scratch
``sitecustomize`` on the children's ``PYTHONPATH`` that registers it under the
``virtual_accelerator`` name. Routing is therefore proven by *value*: the same
read returns 101.0 before the switch and 202.0 after it, and the retired
target's probe channel stops answering at all. Nothing here opens a socket to a
control system, so the suite runs in CI unchanged.

What is deliberately not re-tested here
---------------------------------------
The switch's own failure modes — a failed probe, a failed verification, the
drain deadline — belong to the supervisor and are pinned in
``test_switch_lifecycle.py``. The exception-fidelity test below overlaps
``test_error_envelope_ipc.py`` on purpose and only where the composition is
new: that suite drives a hand-built proxy, this one reaches the child through
``registry.control_system()``, which is the seam every tool actually uses.

Write-visibility isolation — that a value written on one target is not visible
on the other — is also absent here, and cannot be tested with this pair: these
connectors are stateless by construction, answering constants so that a read
identifies the process that served it. Proving isolation needs endpoints that
remember what was written to them, so it is carried by the scripted
two-endpoint demo and the virtual-accelerator e2e scenarios instead.
