"""Fleet-wide hygiene scanner: hardcoded colors, ``var(--x)`` integrity, and
stray token-defining blocks.

This module is the "hygiene" leg of the test pyramid described in the
frontend-design-system PLAN (Task 1.11). It scans every ``.css``/``.js``/
``.html`` asset under ``src/osprey/interfaces/`` plus the single dispatch
dashboard file (the design system is mounted there too, see Task 4.1) for
three independent kinds of drift:

(a) Hardcoded color literals (hex, ``rgb()``/``rgba()``, ``hsl()``/
    ``hsla()``) that should have been expressed as ``var(--token)``
    references instead. This is a strict zero-tolerance check (Task 4.2,
    hygiene-zero-flip): there is no ``hygiene_baseline.json`` ratchet to
    grade against, and every in-scope file must have zero
    non-allowlisted literals — a genuinely justified, permanent survivor
    (a print stylesheet that must stay light-on-white, a fixed categorical
    color with no fleet-wide semantic equivalent, etc.) goes on the
    commented allowlist described below instead of a token.

(b) ``var(--name)`` reference integrity: every custom-property reference
    in the same in-scope assets must resolve to either a name the token
    generator emits (the authoritative set is read straight off the
    committed ``tokens.css``) or a name defined locally within the same
    interface's own asset set — either a CSS/inline-style
    ``--name: ...`` declaration or a JS ``element.style.setProperty
    ('--name', ...)`` call. This has never been a ratchet: it must hold at
    every commit. ``_KNOWN_DANGLING_VARS`` is the allowlist for any
    pre-existing dangling reference that isn't in scope to fix immediately
    (empty as of the hygiene-zero-flip commit — every migration task that
    had an entry cleared it when it fixed the underlying reference). That
    allowlist is checked in both directions: no unexplained new dangling
    ref may appear, and no allowlisted entry may go stale.

(c) Stray token-defining blocks: no ``:root { ... }`` or
    ``[data-theme=...] { ... }`` rule outside ``design_system/static/`` may
    declare custom properties (``--name: value;``). Every interface used to
    ship its own such block (that's what the fleet migration eliminated);
    now the shared ``tokens.css`` is the only legitimate place one exists.
    A ``[data-theme=...]`` rule that only overrides ordinary CSS properties
    (e.g. disabling a dark-only glow effect in light mode) is unaffected by
    this check — it's the act of *defining a custom property* in one of
    these blocks that's disallowed, not the selector itself.

(d) Scale-literal drift: bare numeric/keyword literals for font-size,
    font-weight, line-height, the border-radius family, and
    transition/animation durations that should instead be expressed as
    ``var(--text-*``/``--weight-*``/``--leading-*``/``--radius-*``/
    ``--duration-*)`` references into the scales the token generator now
    emits (see the ``feat(design-system): emit type/spacing/radius/weight/
    leading/z/duration scales`` commit). Unlike (a)-(c) this is not
    fleet-wide: it is scoped per-interface by ``SCALE_ENFORCED_INTERFACES``,
    which names the interfaces that have completed their CSS migration onto
    the scale variables (currently web_terminal and design_system; others join
    the set as they finish their respective migrations). An interface migrates
    its CSS onto the emitted scales, then adds its directory name to lock the
    migration in place and prevent new scale literals. Spacing (margin/padding/
    gap) and z-index are deliberately excluded from this check even for an
    enforced interface: spacing literals are far denser throughout existing
    CSS than the other five properties, and z-index frequently encodes
    legitimate intra-component micro-stacking (a dropdown one layer above
    its trigger, a tooltip above both) that a shared scale can't cleanly
    express. Both may still migrate opportunistically, and the emitted
    ``--space-*``/``--z-*`` scales remain the preferred spelling for new
    code — they're just not enforced here.

Checks (a) and (c) share the same allowlist idea in spirit — a literal,
commented exception list — but check (a)'s allowlist is *in the scanned
files themselves* (an inline marker comment, since ownership of those
files belongs to the migration tasks, not this one) while check (b)'s
lives in this module (there is nothing sensible to "comment out" in a way
that survives a source edit for a missing declaration). Check (d) follows
check (a)'s in-file convention, with its own ``hygiene-allow-scale``
marker (see below) distinct from ``hygiene-allow-color``.
