"""Visual regression suite: per-interface x per-theme screenshot diffing.

Complements ``test_behavioral.py`` (interaction flows) with a pixel-level
check that each interface's *resting* appearance in each theme hasn't
drifted. Every target below is launched as a real standalone app (or, for
the web-terminal hub, a real hub + a real embedded artifacts backend — the
same production wiring ``test_behavioral.py`` uses) via uvicorn in a
background thread, screenshotted at a fixed 1280x800 viewport with real
chromium, and diffed against a committed baseline PNG with Pillow.

Platform split (anti-aliasing/subpixel rendering differs across OSes, so a
byte-level compare only means something when producer and baseline were
rendered on the same platform):

- Linux (CI): the authoritative comparison. A missing baseline is written
  on the spot (bootstrap); an existing one is perceptually diffed with a
  tolerance for AA noise.
- Everywhere else (e.g. a contributor's macOS machine): screenshot capture
  is still exercised and asserted valid, but the byte-compare is skipped
  with an explicit notice — see ``scripts/ci_check.sh`` for the analogous
  local-dev notice pattern.

``--regen-baselines`` (see ``conftest.py``) unconditionally overwrites the
baseline with the freshly captured screenshot, for use on Linux (CI, or a
Linux dev box) to produce the authoritative reference images.

Run:
    .venv/bin/pytest tests/interfaces/design_system/test_visual.py -v

Skips cleanly when the chromium headless binary is not installed.

    the page responds to) rather than the query param the app targets use. Baseline
