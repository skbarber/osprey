"""Browser smoke test for the Theme Lab page.

Proves the one thing no unit test can reach: that the lab's DOM layer actually
boots in a real browser and re-skins both scoped previews live. The math, the
gate scoring and the export markdown are unit-tested in
``tests/interfaces/design_system/js/theme-lab-*.test.mjs``; what is checked here
is the wiring between them and the page.

Specifically:

* the page boots with no console errors (a throwing ``initLab`` would otherwise
  fail silently, leaving a page that merely *looks* right),
* the two ``[data-theme]`` preview scopes really do resolve different token
  sets from ``tokens.css`` — the scoped-theme trick the whole page rests on,
* typing an accent updates each scope's computed ``--color-accent`` *without*
  rebuilding the mock,
* the export block carries the accent, the slug and the full change set, and
* a deliberately low-contrast accent raises a FAIL badge and a warning section.

Follows the harness pattern of ``test_behavioral.py``: a real uvicorn server on
a free port in a background thread, a real chromium browser, and a clean skip
when the chromium binary is not installed.
