"""Browser suite: the shared splitter driven live on the artifacts gallery.

``splitter.test.mjs`` proves the module's contract under happy-dom, and
``tests/interfaces/test_shared_splitter_contract.py`` proves every host wires
it. Neither can prove a *real* drag: happy-dom has no layout, and a static
contract cannot see pointer capture, ``requestAnimationFrame`` coalescing, or
whether the geometry a drag writes actually moves anything on screen.

Scope: the artifacts gallery's browse layout
(``interfaces/artifacts/static/js/browse-layout.js``), specifically its
**y-axis** handle ``#resize-handle-y``. The gallery ships two splitters, one
per axis, and parks whichever the current orientation does not use — so the
stacked ("column") layout must be selected before the y handle is live.

Why this host:

- It is the only splitter host with no live browser coverage of its own.
  ``test_gallery_interactions.py`` drives the gallery hard but never touches
  either handle, and ``test_osprey_drawer.py`` covers only the drawer's x-axis
  ``anchor: 'end'`` geometry and its 320px/90vw clamp.
- It is therefore the only place where a y-axis drag — a different delta sign
  and a different clamp path than the x-axis — is exercised live.

The event dashboard is not a host: it is built from discrete views and has no
resizable pane, so this coverage lives on the gallery instead.

Two assertions a multi-splitter dashboard host would support are deliberately
absent:

- **Preset / ``storageKey: null`` / ``onCommit`` interplay.** No host keeps one
  layout record with a preset system and feeds the splitters through
  ``onCommit``, so there is nothing to assert; the gallery's handles persist
  themselves under their own storage keys, which ``splitter.test.mjs`` already
  covers.
- **The computed ``transition-duration`` half of the drag-suppression check.**
  ``base.css`` suppresses transitions via ``[data-splitter-dragging]``, but the
  assertion is only meaningful on a pane that declares a transition on the
  dragged dimension. ``.browse-sidebar`` does not, so asserting ``0s`` here
  would pass no matter what the rule did. The attribute half — applied for the
  drag, dropped on release — IS asserted, because that is the mechanism itself
  and it is non-vacuous on any host.

Placement rationale: ``design_system`` already owns the pattern of
browser-proving a design-system module against a live consumer app (see
``test_osprey_drawer.py`` and ``test_behavioral.py``), and the module under
test is ``design_system/static/js/splitter.js``.

Run:
    .venv/bin/pytest tests/interfaces/design_system/test_splitter_surfaces.py -v

Skips cleanly when the chromium headless binary is not installed.
