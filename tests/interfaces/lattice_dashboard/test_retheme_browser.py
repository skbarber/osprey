"""Browser test: lattice Plotly figures re-theme live on a theme switch.

Regression guard for the "dark-locked plots" class of bug (the audit's live-
reswitch findings): a Plotly figure's chrome AND its opt-in themed marker must
follow a theme toggle without a reload. render.js wires this through the
design-system theme ``subscribe()`` — this exercises the whole path in a real
browser (module-cached ``render.js`` instance, real ``osprey-display-menu``
pick, real ``Plotly.relayout``/``restyle``), which a TestClient can't see.

It replaces the standalone tuning-panel live-reswitch test that was removed
when the tuning panel was retired, repointed at the lattice ``resonance``
figure (whose worker tags the working-point star ``meta='themed-fg-marker'``).

Skips cleanly when the chromium headless binary is not installed.
