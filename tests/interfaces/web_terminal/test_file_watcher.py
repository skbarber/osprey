#: Tighter than the unit lane's 600 s cap, because this file is the one that
#: has actually hung: ``test_start_creates_directory_if_missing`` sat inside
#: watchdog's ``Observer()`` on a macOS runner until the 40-minute step cap
#: cancelled the job, while the same test takes ~10 ms everywhere else (#743).
#: A minute is roughly four orders of magnitude of headroom over the normal
#: cost, so it can only fire on that hang. No ``skipif(darwin)``: the hang has
#: never been reproduced on demand, and skipping the file would trade a rare
#: red for permanently untested code on the platform where it misbehaves.
#:
#: A timeout failure is ``Failed``, not ``AssertionError``, so a
#: ``flaky(only_rerun=["AssertionError"])`` marker would not rerun it.
