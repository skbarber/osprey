"""Shared fixtures for the web-terminal app tests.

Every test in this directory that drives ``create_app`` through the
``TestClient`` lifespan gets a real :class:`WorkspaceWatcher` — an OS-level
filesystem observer on ``watch_dir``, running on its own thread. That observer
calls ``app.state.broadcaster.broadcast`` for any event it sees, on the very
object tests replace with a mock to capture route broadcasts. A background
thread and the assertion therefore share one counter.

On macOS this is not merely theoretical. watchdog's FSEvents backend defaults
to ``suppress_history=False``, and its own documentation notes the API "may
emit historic events up to 30 sec before the watch was started" — so the
observer replays the ``tmp_path`` creation the fixture itself performed moments
earlier. Delivery is asynchronous, so whether that replay lands inside a test's
assertion window is decided by FSEvents daemon coalescing, not by the test.
That is what made ``test_valid_panel_broadcasts_panel_visibility_event``
intermittently report "Called 2 times" against ``assert_called_once``, and CI
covers ``macos-latest``.

No app test here exercises file watching — the watcher's own tests build it
directly from ``file_watcher``, and the SSE route tests build their own app —
so the observer is stubbed out by default. It is incidental machinery for these
tests, and starting it buys nothing but a 30-second window of foreign events.

Opt back in with ``@pytest.mark.real_workspace_watcher`` when a test genuinely
needs live file watching through the app factory.
