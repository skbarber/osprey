"""WebSocket resume-confirmation tests.

Covers the `mode=resume` confirmation added in `terminal_ws`: today
`session_info` is only emitted on the new-session discovery path, so a
client resuming a stale/absent `--resume-id` has no way to tell a live
resume from a silently-fresh PTY. These tests exercise all three outcomes:

- A reused warm session confirms synchronously with the requested id.
- A cold resume whose session file already exists on disk confirms
  synchronously with the requested id (no discovery needed — the id was
  genuinely valid).
- A freshly-spawned PTY for an id with no file on disk (stale/absent)
  confirms via the discovery mechanism — either the requested id (nothing
  new appeared) or a newly-discovered id (the CLI started a fresh session
  instead).

Mirrors the harness in ``test_session_switching.py``: real ``PtyRegistry``
with ``_spawn_session`` patched to a ``FakePtySession``. ``discover_new_session``
is patched per-test to avoid the real filesystem poll.
