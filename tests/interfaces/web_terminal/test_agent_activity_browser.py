"""Browser tests: agent-activity highlighting, end to end.

``POST /api/agent-activity`` broadcasts an ``agent_activity`` frame over the
``/api/files/events`` SSE stream; the hub front-end turns it into either a
persistent rail badge (kind ``panel`` with a rail entry) or a transient
activity-strip entry (every other kind). None of that is reachable from the
FastAPI TestClient — it only exists once a real browser runs panel-manager.js
and activity-strip.js against a live SSE stream.

Coverage:

  (1) kind ``panel`` targeting a real rail panel → its rail button gains the
      persistent ``agent-attention`` badge; activating the panel (a rail
      click) clears it.
  (2) kind ``channel`` → an ``.activity-strip-entry`` naming the channel
      appears in ``#activity-strip`` and auto-clears after ACTIVITY_CLEAR_MS.
  (3) malformed bodies → 422 AND no DOM change (no strip entry, no badge),
      proven by ordering: a valid frame POSTed *after* the malformed ones
      lands (its badge appears) while the strip stays empty and no other
      badge exists.
  (4) the Plans view's guarded auto-switch, against a real in-process
      bluesky bridge + bluesky-web sidecar: a PATCH /draft with client_id
      ``mcp-agent`` while the panel is unbound on another plan switches the
      panel to the drafted plan and flashes the applied arg fields
      (``agent-flash``); an operator-origin PATCH does neither.
  (5) an agent switch glows the panel's TILE BODY, not only its rail tab —
      with a human rail click as the control that must glow nothing.
  (6) an agent hide reports itself on the activity strip, worded and
      labelled, and glows nothing (the rail entry is already gone); an agent
      show right after is the positive control proving the glow probe armed.
  (7) the history popover: five rapid frames render as five rows, newest
      first, and the same rows — including a hide mirrored into the server
      ring by the panel routes and worded "agent removed …" — come back after
      a reload, served from ``GET /api/agent-activity/recent``.
  (8) badge acknowledgment across a reload: a badge the operator cleared by
      surfacing the panel stays cleared, while a newer unseen event restores
      one. Each half is the other's discriminator.
  (9) the logbook's sender-local ``osprey:navigate`` postMessage: the sending
      client navigates and activates with NO agent attribution, a second
      browser context is untouched, and a ``javascript:`` or protocol-relative
      url is ignored by the host.
  (10) reduced motion: the same flash resolves to the held-ring keyframes
      (constant box-shadow, no background fill) instead of the decay, and
      still self-cleans.

Transient ``agent-flash`` classes self-clean on animationend (~900ms), so
they are observed through a document-start MutationObserver log rather than
racing Playwright's polling against the animation. SSE readiness is likewise
observed directly (an EventSource wrapper records opened stream URLs) so no
test POSTs before its page is actually subscribed.

Run:
    .venv/bin/pytest tests/interfaces/web_terminal/test_agent_activity_browser.py -v

Skips cleanly when the chromium headless binary is not installed.

    Both halves run against the same element in the same page, so the only
    variable is the media preference. Each assertion is chosen to come out
    DIFFERENTLY under the two branches:

      * duration — 0.9s decay vs the 1.2s hold (a longer dwell, because a
        still ring has no motion to catch the eye);
      * box-shadow sampled at two offsets — decaying vs identical;
      * background-color — the discriminating probe for the override winning.
        The base keyframes fill the element with --accent-tint-20 and fade it
        out; the reduced-motion keyframes deliberately omit background-color,
        so the element keeps its own. Same animation NAME either way, which is
        exactly why the name alone proves nothing here;
      * the class self-cleans — the property `animation: none` would have
        broken, since it never fires animationend.

    One theme is enough: the branch under test is the media query, and every
    theme reaches it through the same two accent tokens.
