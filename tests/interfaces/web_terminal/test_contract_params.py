"""Browser tests for the shell<->panel micro-frontend contract (Phase 1).

Proves the three transports a host page (the web-terminal hub, or a
standalone panel opened directly) and an embedded panel use to talk to each
other, each of which is invisible to a FastAPI ``TestClient`` because it
requires a real browser evaluating real page script:

- **query = creation-time config.** ``?embedded=true`` -> ``applyEmbedded()``
  (design-system ``frame-params.js``) adds the ``embedded`` class to
  ``document.body``; ``?theme=<id>`` -> ``theme-boot.js`` applies
  ``data-theme`` before first paint and ``theme-manager.js`` follows it.
  See :func:`test_query_params_configure_embedded_and_theme`.
- **hash = panel-owned deep-link.** okf_panel reads its own
  ``location.hash`` and routes to that concept on load
  (``readPanelParams``/``bootFromParams`` in okf_panel's ``app.js``); the hub
  sets no hash at all. See :func:`test_hash_deep_links_to_concept`.
- **postMessage = live push.** Senders post with target origin
  ``window.location.origin``; receivers guard with
  ``if (e.origin !== window.location.origin) return;``. A real same-page
  ``postMessage`` always stamps ``event.origin`` as the page's own origin, so
  it can only exercise the *accept* path; the *reject* path is exercised with
  an in-page synthetic ``window.dispatchEvent(new MessageEvent('message',
  {origin: 'https://evil.example', ...}))``, which is the only way to give
  ``event.origin`` a value a real cross-document postMessage could never
  produce here.

All four postMessage receivers are driven directly in a live browser (no
review-based fallback was needed):

- ``theme-manager.js`` ``_handleMessage`` -- :func:`test_postmessage_theme_change_same_origin_only`
- ``artifacts`` gallery.js session-change receiver -- :func:`test_postmessage_session_change_gallery_rejects_foreign_origin`
- ``web_terminal`` ``session.html`` session-change receiver --
  :func:`test_postmessage_session_change_session_html_rejects_foreign_origin`.
  ``/static/session.html`` turned out to be independently drivable: web_terminal's
  ``configure_interface_app(app, static_dir=STATIC_DIR)`` mounts the interface's
  whole ``static/`` directory at ``/static``, and ``session.html`` lives directly
  under it, so ``GET /static/session.html`` serves it like any other static asset.
- ``web_terminal`` app.js paste-to-terminal receiver -- :func:`test_postmessage_paste_to_terminal_rejects_foreign_origin`

Each postMessage test also includes a same-origin "positive control" after
the foreign-origin rejection check: a genuine same-origin message that IS
expected to take effect. This guards against a vacuous pass -- proving the
detection technique used for the rejection assertion (a request URL, or a
WebSocket frame) is actually capable of observing the effect it claims is
absent.
