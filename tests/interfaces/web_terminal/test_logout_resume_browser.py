"""Browser test: multi-user logout -> landing -> return starts a FRESH station.

Exercises the client-side half of the multi-user round trip in a real Chromium
page — the part a FastAPI TestClient can't see because it neither runs the
frontend JS nor persists ``localStorage`` across navigations:

  * the display menu's session footer — the identity line naming the user and
    the logout control beside System Settings (``#logout-btn`` carrying
    ``data-landing-url``) — renders only when the server emitted a non-empty
    ``terminal_user`` / ``landing_url`` (multi-user);
  * clicking logout POSTs the real server logout route (``logout_terminal``,
    routes/websocket.py — empties the PTY and operator registries), clears the
    client's stored PTY session id, THEN navigates to the configured landing
    origin;
  * returning to the terminal origin does NOT resume the prior warm PTY —
    this persona's stored pointer stays empty across the round trip and the
    client opens a brand-new WebSocket (no ``mode=resume``, no stale
    ``session_id``) rather than reconnecting to the old session. This is M2:
    logout is a real station reset, not just a client-side navigation.
  * the pointer is the PER-PERSONA key. On a multi-user mount every ``/u/<user>/``
    shares one origin and so one ``localStorage``; the server stamps
    ``data-osprey-storage-scope`` on ``<html>`` and terminal.js reads, writes
    and clears ``osprey-pty-session--<user>`` (design_system/storage-scope.js),
    never the bare shared slot. This is the only multi-user browser suite, so it
    is also the live proof that the scoped clear is what logout performs.
  * plain ``osprey web`` (no landing_url) omits the logout control entirely.

Scope note — no live model turn. A genuinely live PTY session id is minted by
Claude (``SessionDiscovery`` watching for the CLI's ``.jsonl`` file), which needs
the ``claude`` binary + a provider and is infeasible in a headless CI browser.
So this asserts the reset *mechanism* deterministically: the shell command is a
long-lived ``sleep`` (so a supposed resume connection would stay open rather
than exiting, which would otherwise mask a resume-vs-fresh distinction), and a
warm session is represented by seeding ``localStorage`` directly before logout.
What's proven is the client contract — the stored pointer is gone and the
post-logout WebSocket asks for a fresh session — not a real Claude conversation
being torn down.

Skips cleanly when the chromium headless binary is not installed.
