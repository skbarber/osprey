"""Browser tests: the feedback dialog's keyboard, layering and Local round-trip.

Everything here is a claim only a real browser can settle. The focus trap needs
a layout engine (``focusableElements`` filters on ``offsetParent``, which is
null for everything under happy-dom). The Escape/Cmd-K arbitration between the
dialog, the command palette and ``<osprey-drawer>`` is three capture-phase
document listeners racing in registration order. The ``inert`` question is
about what the drawer's ``_syncBackgroundInert()`` pass did to a node that no
longer exists — the reason the dialog is destroyed on close instead of parked.
And the Local send is the only test in the tree that drives a report from a
keystroke in the textarea all the way to an ``fb-*.json`` on the server's disk.

Coverage:

  (1) Tab cycles through every control of the open dialog and wraps.
  (2) Cmd/Ctrl+K while the dialog is open does NOT open the palette — and the
      same key does open it once the dialog is gone (the control that keeps
      the negative honest).
  (3) Escape with the palette layered over the dialog closes only the palette.
  (4) A settings-drawer open/close cycle leaves no ``inert`` on a reopened
      dialog.
  (5) Local send: type, Send, and the record lands in the server's store.

Run:
    .venv/bin/pytest tests/interfaces/web_terminal/test_feedback_modal_browser.py -v

Skips cleanly when the chromium headless binary is not installed.
