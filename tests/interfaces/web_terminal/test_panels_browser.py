"""Browser smoke tests: the docked (dockview) workspace and its server bridge.

The service panels do not live in a fixed left/right split — they are docked
in a dockview grid (``dock-workspace.js``) whose panel content follows an overlay
iframe layer (``dock-iframe.js``), with a state bridge (``dock-sync.js``) that
turns human dock gestures into the same server POSTs the agent's MCP calls make.
These tests drive that stack through a real browser and a live SSE stream — the
parts the FastAPI TestClient cannot reach.

One panel per tile is a workspace invariant: the rail is the tab system, so an
activation REPLACES the focused service tile's panel (the evicted panel closes
server-side and dims on the rail), the "+" add menu and the rail entry's
"Open in a new tile" are the verbs that open a NEW tile beside the current one,
and no drop geometry may stack tabs.

What is proven here, grouped:

  * SSE / rail flows materialize as dockview panels: focusing a service panel
    docks a placeholder whose overlay iframe tracks the group geometry — taking
    the focused tile over from its previous panel; hiding a panel removes its
    placeholder; register appends a rail entry WITHOUT auto-docking.
  * The echo guard (``dock-sync.js``): a human dock-tab focus POSTs setPanelFocus
    exactly once, a human tab-close POSTs visibility(false), and a server-driven
    SSE focus is applied WITHOUT POSTing back (no feedback loop).
  * Drag rearrange via real Playwright drags — a tile moves to a new edge
    position, and a drop that would stack (onto another tile's tab bar) is
    vetoed — asserted with getBoundingClientRect geometry, and the overlay
    iframe re-following the dragged panel's new rectangle.
  * Layout persistence keyed by project_key: an expert arrangement survives a
    reload, two project cwds keep distinct layouts on one origin, reset restores
    the default, and a corrupt stored value falls back cleanly.
  * Locked simple mode: no drag affordance (a drag is a no-op) and no per-tab
    close control; an SSE register during simple mode is folded in with no dead
    tabs once the operator flips back to expert.
  * The "+" add menu: unclipped geometry beside the rail, URL-row gating, reveal a
    hidden panel INTO A NEW TILE beside the active one, register from URL, and
    inline register errors.
  * Tile header-bar contributions (the embed contract): a panel's own nav, search
    and overflow items render in ITS bar only, actions round-trip into the iframe,
    and the bar's drag ghost keeps its icons bar-sized.
  * The right-click context menu (``panel-context-menu.js``), the only home left
    for the open-beside and pop-out verbs: the rows a rail entry and a tile header
    offer, the surfaces that DECLINE (an offline entry by mouse or keyboard, a
    contributed header input, the terminal in simple mode), and the dismissals
    that need real focus and real event targets — a click into a panel iframe,
    and the scroll scoping that leaves the menu standing while xterm scrolls.
  * The command palette: it opens with the input focused and typing filters
    immediately, its Panels rows cover the ACTIVE panel and answer domain
    synonyms, a pop-out row really opens the proxied panel URL, and executed
    items come back under "Recent" on an empty query.

Each test launches a real uvicorn server in a background thread, drives events
through the REST API, and asserts the DOM via Playwright auto-waiting.

Run:
    uv run pytest tests/interfaces/web_terminal/test_panels_browser.py -q

Skips cleanly when the chromium headless binary is not installed.

# The drag ghost dockview builds for a tab is a deep clone of that tab, parented
# to document.body — OUTSIDE #dock-root (verified against the vendored 7.0.2
# bundle: the Tab's `createGhost` calls `_buildGhostElement()`, which clones the
# element and inlines the computed style ON THE ROOT ONLY, then `addGhostImage`
# appends the clone to document.body before `setDragImage`; the pointer-drag
# path parents its ghost to document.body too).
#
# So a tile's drag image is styled by whatever still matches once the bar is out
# of #dock-root. Two things keep that honest, and this test guards both:
#
#   * The tile-bar rules in dockview-overrides.css anchor on `.tile-tab` — a
#     class the clone carries — not on `.dock-root`. Anchoring on the dock root
#     leaves the ghost as unstyled DOM (the bar lays out `block`, controls fall
#     back to intrinsic sizes).
#   * svg-icons.js gives each icon an intrinsic width/height. A viewBox alone
#     gives an SVG an intrinsic RATIO but no intrinsic SIZE, so `width: auto`
#     resolves to the containing block's width and the 1:1 ratio squares it —
#     the search icon painted as a ~400px magnifying glass riding the cursor
#     (the close × collapsed to 0 instead, its container being zero-width).

#   * FR3/FR5 - the surfaces that must DECLINE: a disabled entry (mouse on its

#     the browser's own text menu has to survive. No test can see that native
#     menu; what it can hold the app to is that the app's own popover stays
#     away and the event is left to the browser.
#   * FR4 - the dismissals that depend on real focus and real event targets: a
#     click landing inside a panel iframe (which never reaches this document —
#     only `window` blur does), and the scroll scoping that keeps the menu
#     standing while the terminal streams output.

# Command palette (FR7-FR9)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# What only a real browser can settle about the palette:
#
#   * FR7 - focus. The input is focused inside the same rAF that reveals the
#     overlay, because focusing a node in a `visibility: hidden` subtree is a
#     spec'd no-op. happy-dom has no visibility model, so it cannot tell a
#     working focus call from the broken one; a real keystroke landing in the
#     input is the only proof.
#   * FR8 - the Panels rows. The registry unit tests prove the row set from
#     injected getters; these prove the LIVE getters produce it: ARIEL's
#     standalone URL really resolved through /api/ariel-server, and the active
#     panel really is included in the popout source and excluded from the
#     new-tile source.
#   * FR8 - the popout verb end to end: `window.open` opens a real page on the
#     proxied, same-origin /panel/<id> URL.
#   * FR9 - Recent. Real localStorage, and the section really renders first on
#     an empty query and survives a reload.
#
# ARIEL is the panel under test because it is the one the synonym table has
# domain vocabulary for ("logbook"/"elog"). It is enabled as a built-in panel
# with its companion server URL published post-startup - the catalog entry
# carries no healthEndpoint, so it is healthy the moment its config fetch
# resolves, and the stub backend behind it lets the proxied /panel/ariel URL
# answer for real when a popout navigates to it.
