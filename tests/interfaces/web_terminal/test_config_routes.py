"""Tests for the ``/api/config`` write surface: the protected-set gate, and regen.

Two things are under test here.

**The protected-set gate.** ``config.yml`` carries the write gate, the approval
gate, the agent's rendered permission surface and the paths the safety layers
derive their allow and deny areas from. A surface that can set those keys is a
surface that can un-gate the agent, so neither of the panel's two write paths
into the file may, whoever is driving them:

* ``PATCH /api/config`` is the structured path, judged key by key against the
  protected set -- :class:`TestPatchProtectedKeys`.
* ``PUT /api/config`` is the Raw YAML path, which replaces the whole document
  verbatim and so names nothing. It is judged by a document diff: the protected
  *view* of the incoming bytes must equal the protected view of the bytes on
  disk. One comparison, every mutation class -- a key added, deleted or changed,
  a family removed wholesale, a subtree reshaped in either direction -- and it
  is done on segment tuples, never dotted strings, so a raw key containing a
  ``.`` cannot collide with a real nested one and hide a change behind it.
  :class:`TestPutProtectedDocument`.

Three properties are load-bearing on both paths and each is asserted directly:

* **Nothing moves.** A refused PATCH leaves ``config.yml`` byte-identical and
  creates no backup. Byte comparison rather than a parsed one, because a
  round-trip that rewrote the file with the same values would still be a write;
  and the backup counts too, since it is a copy of a file this request turned out
  not to be allowed to touch. The backup no longer lands beside ``config.yml`` --
  it goes into the agent-data state zone, which is the tree that stays writable
  once the render is root-owned -- so these pins look for it there.
* **All-or-nothing.** One protected key refuses the whole body. A mixed request
  does not get to land its cosmetic half.
* **It leaves a trace.** One ``http_config`` ledger record per refused key
  and one activity frame, so the attempt is visible to the operator afterwards
  and not only to whoever saw the 403. The frame is stamped in-process, which is
  the point: no ``OSPREY_PANEL_TOKEN`` is needed to publish it.

**Regeneration.** The GitHub #244 fix: a config write re-renders the ``.claude/``
artifacts so safety-critical fields take effect on the next terminal restart.
That path now belongs to PUT, because no key that shapes the render survives the
PATCH gate -- which is the protected set doing exactly its job. The PATCH regen
tests below therefore run on ``claude_code.default_model``, an agent-relevant key
the panel may still write, and assert the honest outcome: the write lands, and
there is nothing to re-render. PUT keeps a live regen because unprotected keys
that *do* shape the render still exist -- ``channel_finder.pipeline_mode`` is
one, and it moves ``settings.json`` -- while the safety-critical fields it used
to be demonstrated with are now refused before any of it happens.

Uses a minimal FastAPI app over the routes router (no lifespan) pointed at a real
built project so ``regenerate_claude_code`` has artifacts to update.
