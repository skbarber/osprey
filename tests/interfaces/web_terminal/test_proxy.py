"""The panel proxy as a credential boundary, in both directions.

Everything reaching ``/panel/<id>/...`` was authenticated as the operator at
the terminal's origin, and the browser attaches that proof — session cookie,
``Authorization``, and behind the multi-user reverse proxy an
``X-Osprey-Terminal-Secret`` header — to panel requests as well, because a
panel shares that origin. The backend on the far side of the proxy hop does
not share the trust: it may be a facility Grafana, or a URL an agent
registered at runtime.

These tests pin every side of that boundary:

* nothing that identifies the operator crosses the hop outbound, for any panel;
* the operator secret is re-issued only toward a backend that is *both*
  config-declared *and* addressed at loopback — with every ambiguous case
  (unresolvable host, runtime registration, off-box address) resolving to no
  injection rather than to a leak;
* nothing a backend sends back can act on the terminal's origin: no
  ``Set-Cookie`` (which would land in the operator's jar for the terminal, on
  the terminal's own session-cookie name), no CORS grant; and
* no proxied request follows a redirect, so a backend can steer neither the
  secret nor this process's network reach.

**Auth here is explicit.** The module opts out of the shared TestClient auth
seam (``pytestmark`` below), which force-sets the operator header on every
request: with the seam on, a test that puts its own value in that header never
gets it onto the wire — the app sees the seam's — so the strip assertions pass
whether or not the proxy strips anything. Requests instead authenticate the way
a real caller does, and which way is load-bearing per test:

* :data:`OPERATOR_HEADERS` — the multi-user shape, nginx's operator-secret
  header plus what the browser attached. Used where the point is that an
  *inbound* credential does not survive the hop.
* a **session cookie** (:func:`_cookie_client`) — the single-user browser shape,
  carrying no secret header at all. Used where the point is that the secret
  observed upstream was *injected by this process*, which a request that
  carried one inbound could never show.
