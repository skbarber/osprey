"""Browser tests: the collaborative-panels contract between dock and server.

``test_panels_browser.py`` proves the docked workspace itself (tiles, drags,
persistence, the echo guard). This suite proves the *two-party* contract layered
on top of it — the one where the agent finally sees, and can rearrange, what is
actually on screen:

  * the occupancy REPORT (``POST /api/panel-layout`` → ``GET /api/panels``'s
    ``open_tiles`` / ``open_tiles_age_s`` / ``open_tiles_dock``),
  * the polite agent SWITCH (``panel-focus`` with ``source: agent`` opens a tile
    *beside* the operator's instead of evicting it),
  * the declarative ARRANGE (``POST /api/panel-arrange``, shared by the agent's
    ``arrange_workspace`` and the human "Layouts" click).

Every assertion here needs a real dockview grid, a real SSE stream and real
client-side fetches, so none of it is reachable from the unit suites:

  * ``open_tiles`` is serialized from the live grid tree — a Python test can post
    any list it likes, but only a browser can prove the list the dock produces.
  * the "no echo loop" criteria are about POSTs a client does **not** make.
    They are asserted by intercepting the page's own requests; a mocked fetch
    proves only that the mock was not called.
  * the vertical axis of the reading order (a column reported top-to-bottom
    *before* what sits beside it) has no serialized representation to assert
    against — a persisted branch carries no orientation, so the ordering can
    only be pinned by making a real vertical split and reading the result back.

Run:
    uv run pytest tests/interfaces/web_terminal/test_panels_collab_browser.py -m browser -v

Skips cleanly when the chromium headless binary is not installed.

    The arrangement is a declarative end state, so the workspace a client starts

    ``POST /api/panel-arrange`` names two tiles and a focus target; both pages
    must land on exactly those tiles, in that order, focused the same way.

    The second half is the convergence criterion. Applying an arrangement makes
    the dock emit layout changes, each of which the reporter would post — and
    every report the server *stored* would be a fact a hook could read. If the
    dedupe on either end were missing, the two clients would ping-pong reports

    Panel health only exists in the browser, so the server records the requested
    focus verbatim and the client applies the fallback rule: the requested panel
    if it is healthy, else the first healthy tile listed. Here the requested
    focus target is a panel whose health endpoint is a dead port, so focus must
    land on the other listed tile instead.

    The starting focus is deliberately on a panel the arrangement does NOT list.
    Left on the boot default, focus would already be sitting on ``artifacts``
    (the default panel auto-activates on its first healthy settle), and the
    fallback assertion would be confirming a state that was true before the
    arrangement ran — it would still pass with the healthy-fallback rule deleted.
    From a start focused on an unlisted panel, losing that rule instead clears
    the active state altogether, and the assertion fails as it should.

    The second assertion is the one that keeps the workspace honest: a tile is
    only ever docked for a panel that can fill it. An unhealthy panel's
    activation refuses, so docking a tile for it would leave a permanently empty
    rectangle on the operator's screen — worse than not opening it at all. Its

    Three states share one field, and collapsing any two of them would let a

    * **known empty** — a dock client reports that the operator closed every
      service tile: ``[]`` with ``dock: true``.
    * **unknown** — a client without a dock shell is watching but cannot see
      tile order. It sends a presence report whose ``tiles`` the server must
      record as *null*, not as an empty workspace, or a fallback client would
      overwrite a real list with a confident lie.

    The dock-less client is real, not simulated: the dockview bundle is blocked
    for that page, so the shell genuinely never arrives and the client reaches
    its own give-up branch.
