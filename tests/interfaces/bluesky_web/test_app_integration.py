"""Integration tests for the COMPOSED bluesky-web sidecar app.

The per-router unit tests in this directory (``test_read_proxy.py``,
``test_queue_relay.py``, ``test_health.py``) each mount
a single router onto a locally-built ``FastAPI()`` instance. This module
instead exercises the package-level ``osprey.interfaces.bluesky_web.app:app``
-- the object actually served in production -- to catch wiring bugs that a
per-router test can't see: router composition, static-mount registration,
and the shared design-system/fonts assets.

``TestClient(app)`` is entered as a context manager so the app's real
``_lifespan`` runs (it sets ``app.state.client``/``app.state.bridge_url`` from
env/config resolution, mirroring production startup). Once inside the
context, each test overwrites ``app.state.client`` with an
``httpx.AsyncClient(transport=httpx.MockTransport(...))`` and
``app.state.bridge_url`` with a fixed test URL, since every route reads those
two attributes off ``request.app.state`` at request time (not at import or
lifespan time) -- see ``read_proxy._forward_get`` and the queue relay's write
routes. The lifespan's own ``finally: await
client.aclose()`` still closes the ORIGINAL client object it created (it
holds a local reference, not ``app.state.client``), so no double-close or
leak occurs when a test swaps the app-state client out from under it.
