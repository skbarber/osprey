"""Shared-splitter contract: one divider implementation, every resizable pane.

The OKF knowledge panel, the artifact gallery's browse view, the PLAN panel,
the LATTICE control sidebar, and the settings drawer all put a draggable
divider between two panes. Hand-copying that implementation per host lets the
copies drift — a grip pill as a child element in one and a ``::after`` in
another, disagreeing hover treatments, keyboard and ARIA support in only some
— because nothing fails when a copy stops matching. This is that missing
failure.

The event dashboard is not a host: it is built from discrete views and has no
resizable pane to divide, so it is not listed here.

The contract is static and deliberately shallow: each host's markup must carry
the shared ``.osprey-splitter`` class on a proper ARIA separator, each host's
script must drive it from the design system's ``splitter.js``, and no host may
re-declare the shared visual. Behaviour itself is covered once, in
``tests/interfaces/design_system/splitter.test.mjs``; the surfaces are driven
live in ``tests/interfaces/design_system/test_splitter_surfaces.py``.

Two rules here exist because of specific bugs this suite is meant to prevent:

- **Every** splitter tag is checked, not just the first. The gallery ships two
  handles (one per orientation), and a first-match-only assertion would leave
  whichever one happened to be second entirely unguarded.
- ``aria-orientation`` is checked against a per-host expected set rather than
  hardcoded to ``vertical``. ``splitter.js`` sets the attribute at runtime from
  its ``axis`` option, but a static guard can only see markup — so hosts
  declare it too, which also means the separator is correctly labelled before
  the module loads.
