"""Shared fixtures for real-browser Playwright suites under ``tests/interfaces/``.

Extracted from the byte-identical boilerplate duplicated across
``design_system/test_behavioral.py``, ``design_system/test_visual.py``, and
``web_terminal/test_panels_browser.py``: the free-port/wait-for-port helpers,
the generic FastAPI-on-a-background-thread launcher, and the function-scoped
Playwright browser fixture. Suite-specific live-server wrappers (hub launchers
with their own patch sets) stay local to each file.
