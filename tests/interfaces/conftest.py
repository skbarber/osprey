# /api/panel-visibility, /api/agent-activity, /__test__/… helpers). Those calls
# carry no browser cookie, so under WebAuthMiddleware they are refused with 401.

# The root-conftest auth seam (task 9.1) force-sets the operator-secret header on
# TestClient and httpx clients, but not on ``requests`` — which only these
# real-browser suites use. This mirrors that mechanism for ``requests``: it adds
# ``X-Osprey-Terminal-Secret`` (read from this process's credential holder, the
# same object the in-process server's gate verifies against) to every loopback
# request. Mutating POSTs and PATCHes pass too: the gate checks the ``Origin``
# header on every credential path, operator header included, but only when one is
# PRESENT — and neither ``requests`` nor ``TestClient`` sends an ``Origin`` on a
# programmatic call, so the check never applies to these.
