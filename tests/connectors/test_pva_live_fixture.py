"""What a client sees when it reads a real PVAccess server over the wire.

Everything here runs in **one process**: a real ``p4p`` server hosting real
normative-type structures, the real EPICS connector routing addresses onto its
PVA client, and — for the batch and artifact assertions — the real
``channel_read`` tool body deciding what the agent gets to see. No fake p4p
module, no hand-rolled ``Value``. ``tests/connectors/test_pva_read_mapping.py``
already proves the mapping in process against an injected client; this file is
the check that the wire agrees with it, and it is where success criteria 1-4 of
the PVA feature are asserted concretely.

Three things about the venue are worth stating plainly, because a green run
means nothing without them.

**p4p is the venue's hard requirement.** The module is ``importorskip``-gated,
and a skipped suite proves nothing at all — which is why
``tests/connectors/test_pva_venue_guard.py`` fails the lane on any platform
where p4p must be importable.

**The server is isolated, and the client is pinned to it.** ``Server(...,
isolate=True)`` binds to 127.0.0.1 on a randomly chosen port and does not
beacon off the loopback interface, so concurrent runs of this file — and the
operator's own IOCs — can never answer for each other. The connector is pointed
at that port through ``pva_gateway.use_name_server``, which sets
``EPICS_PVA_NAME_SERVERS``: the client then opens a TCP connection straight to
the server instead of UDP-searching for it, so no search packet leaves the
host. The suite-wide ``restore_environ`` fixture puts every ``EPICS_PVA_*``
variable the connector wrote back after each test.

**The Channel Access half of the mixed batch is unreachable on purpose.** Its
address matches no ``pva_channels`` glob, so it takes the CA path, where no
server answers it — that is the point, and the connector's timeout is kept
short so the failure costs a second rather than a suite.
