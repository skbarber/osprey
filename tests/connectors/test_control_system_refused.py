"""A control-system denial of a write is a structured refusal, not an internal error.

When an IOC's access security refuses a put, the client library raises
``epics.ca.CASeverityException`` out of ``caput``. That exception used to escape
``write_channel`` and land in the MCP catch-all as ``internal_error`` — an
answer that told the operator nothing and misattributed the denial.

The invariant this file pins: such a denial comes back as
``ChannelWriteResult(outcome=WriteOutcome.REFUSED,
refusal_reason="CONTROL_SYSTEM_REFUSED")``, its message names the CONTROL
SYSTEM rather than OSPREY's reference monitor, and every rendering path that
sees it says the same thing. The narrowing matters as much as the catch: any
other exception raised by ``caput`` (a dead gateway, a timeout) is still a
genuine failure and still propagates untouched.

``epics`` is never imported here — not at module scope, not inside a test. The
connector resolves the exception class off the module it connected with, so a
locally defined stand-in attached to the mock is a faithful stand-in.
