"""A readonly sandbox run is refused at the connector, whatever the deployment posture.

``control_system.writes_enabled`` is the launch-time deployment posture. The
python executor additionally exports ``OSPREY_EXECUTION_MODE`` into its
sandbox subprocess; when that says ``readonly`` the connector base class
refuses every write before any connector-specific code runs — so
``osprey.runtime.write_channel`` and direct ``connector.write_channel`` calls
alike are blocked in a readonly run even on a write-enabled deployment.
