"""Four contracts that decide whether a deployment has one archive or two.

A project that serves simulated channels has a live half and a stored half, and
the whole point of seeding the store from the same generators the live half uses
is that the two are one world. That claim is easy to state and easy to lose: a
second epoch conversion, a grid anchored on the seed instant, a scenario rewrite
that forgets a stretch of history — each of them leaves a store that is merely
*plausible* next to what a query would compute. These tests are the acceptance
surface for the claim, checked end to end against a real MongoDB through the
same connectors a deployed agent uses.

* **Equivalence.** A value read out of the store equals, bit for bit, the value
  the mock archiver synthesizes for the same instant — on engine-served channels
  and on procedural ones, and across the hot/tail boundary where the seed grid
  changes density. Once a scenario is applied, no sample inside its event window
  still reads clean: a gap there would be a stretch of calm history sitting
  inside a fault the agent is being asked to diagnose.

* **Retention.** History ages like history. A forced pass of mongod's own TTL
  sweeper takes the aged samples of *both* tiers and leaves the event windows a
  scenario protected standing, because the evidence a fault is diagnosed from
  must never be the thing retention prunes first. The block compressor the
  manifest claims is the one the server actually used.

* **Knob change.** Moving ``retention_days`` in the rendered ``config.yml`` —
  one YAML value, no code — makes the stored fingerprint mismatch, and the
  reseed that follows really does reach further back.

* **Scenario-switch honesty.** Applying an eventful scenario and then an
  eventless one leaves the store bit-identical to its base, read back through
  ``MongoDBArchiverConnector``. The module-level counterpart of this contract is
  ``tests/simulation/test_archiver_scenario_seed.py::
  test_switching_back_leaves_no_trace_of_the_previous_scenario``, which pins the
  same property on the collection directly; this one is the connector's view of
  it, so a divergence that only the read path could introduce has somewhere to
  show up.

Everything here needs Docker and skips cleanly without it. There is no LLM in
this file and no network beyond the container.

The container is this module's own rather than the shared session fixture in
``conftest.py``, for two reasons that are part of what is under test. The block
compressor is a *server start flag* (``--wiredTigerCollectionBlockCompressor``,
exactly as the ``mongodb`` compose template renders it), so a default server
could only confirm mongod's default. And mongod's TTL monitor is switched off at
startup here and turned on for the one test that wants a sweep — every other
anchor in this file is deliberately in the past, and a live sweeper would delete
those stores out from under their assertions.
