"""Standalone proof that write_channel_checked is RunEngine-consumable.

Task 3.2: this is a throwaway fixture that demonstrates the reference monitor's
denial contract composes with an ophyd_async device setter — WITHOUT importing
any of the dependent feature's device layer. A ~15-line stub setter calls
``write_channel_checked`` inside ``AsyncStatus.wrap``; awaiting the resulting
``AsyncStatus`` is exactly what a RunEngine does when it drives ``set()``.

``AsyncStatus.wrap`` decorates an ``async def`` and returns a callable producing
an ``AsyncStatus``. Awaiting that status runs the wrapped coroutine and re-raises
any exception it throws — so a refused write surfaces as a failed status, which
aborts the plan. A confirmed write returns and the status succeeds.

The connector helper speaks only the generic interface, so a minimal in-file
fake connector exercises it without any EPICS/DOOCS machinery.
