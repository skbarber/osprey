"""Consistency tests binding machine.json's lattice-channel population to the
namespace-union manifest (task 4.6), after the one-facility calibration grew
both to the full ALS-U Accumulator Ring inventory declared by
``osprey.simulation.facility_spec.ALS_U_AR``.

The manifest (built by
``osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.manifest.build_manifest()``, and
committed to disk as ``channel_manifest.json``) classifies every namespace
address into partition (a) ``pyat-coupled`` (SR magnet CURRENT SP/RB + SR BPM
POSITION X/Y -- backed by the AT lattice model), (b) ``sp-echo`` (writable but
physics-free), and (c) ``static-noisy`` (everything else). ``machine.json`` is
the scenario-seed data the simulation engine serves in mock mode; every
pyat-coupled address must resolve to a real, calibrated entry there, or a
mock read/write of that channel is a connection-refused fiction.

This module also pins the manifest-file consistency invariant that ends the
stale-manifest split-brain: the committed ``channel_manifest.json`` must
always equal ``build_manifest()``'s live output, so a future lattice/spec
change can't silently drift the two apart.
