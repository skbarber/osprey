"""Consistency test for ``channel_limits.json``.

``channel_limits.json`` is a pure projection of the namespace-union manifest
(``osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.manifest``): it carries exactly one
entry for every address the manifest defines, and the write-safety contract
is a single rule --

    a channel is writable if and only if it is a setpoint (``:SP``).

The manifest's 396 writable ``:SP`` addresses each get a writable entry with
min/max bounds (family-banded from the SR lattice model's device inventory,
``osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.lattice``, and machine.json's simulated
nominal values) plus the post-write confirming re-read. Every other manifest address -- readbacks
(``:RB``, BPM ``:X``/``:Y``), status/fault flags, golden references and slow
telemetry -- gets a read-only entry (``writable: false``) so OSPREY's own
software safety layer refuses a write to it, rather than leaving the block to
the downstream IOC. ``TestValidatorEnforcesTheContract`` proves the shipped
file, loaded by the real LimitsValidator, does exactly that.

Historically the file carried five illustrative example entries -- two using an
obsolete bracket convention (``MAG:HCM[H01]:CURRENT:SP``,
``MAG:QF[QF01]:CURRENT:SP``) and three fictional FEL-tutorial names
(``ElectronGunFilamentCurrentSetPoint``, ``TerminalVoltageSetValue``,
``DIAGNOSTICS:TEMPERATURE:SP``) -- none of which is a real manifest address.
They are pinned in ``STALE_ADDRESSES`` below so they can never reappear. The
generic write-safety e2e that once relied on them now use a dedicated,
decoupled fixture (tests/e2e/claude_code/fixtures/safety_limits.json).

``max_step`` is deliberately NOT set on any entry: LimitsValidator's max_step
check (src/osprey/connectors/control_system/limits_validator.py) reads the
current value via a direct, connector-unaware ``epics.caget`` -- configuring
it on these channels would block every write to them under the mock control
system (the preset's default type), which has no live EPICS server behind its
addresses. min/max bounds plus the post-write confirming re-read already satisfy
"a write outside its limits is rejected" (SC9) without that failure mode.
