"""The control-assistant preset seeds its graph store from the demo machine.

Two files have to agree for a fresh `osprey up` to bring up a graph the agent
can actually search: the `services.graphdb.ttl_path` in the preset's
`config.yml.j2`, and the corpus that path names. Nothing else checks that pair
— the deploy reads the corpus at seed time and only warns when it is missing,
so a preset pointing at a file the render does not ship would deploy an empty
store and say nothing about it. That is the first test here: render the preset
the way the CLI does, resolve the key the way the deploy does, and require the
file to be on disk.

The rest pins what is *in* that corpus. It is generated — `osprey knowledge
build-ttl` derives it from the channel database in the same `data/` tree — and
a generated file that nobody counts can drift silently: a change to the channel
database, the direction pass, or the emitter would quietly ship a different
graph. The census below (512 devices, 2908 bindings, 396 written and 2512 read
signals) is the demo machine as of the corpus committed beside this test, and
the 396 writes are exactly its `:SP` addresses. The prose census sits beside it:
three description predicates on every binding, three more plus the SYSTEM token
on every device, and none of the six on a semantic signal.

The uppercase check guards the other half of the pipeline. neosemantics imports
a predicate IRI under the local name it finds, so `narad_p:hasBinding` becomes
the relationship type `hasBinding` — but n10s also has a `LABELS_AND_NODES`
handling that would uppercase it to `HASBINDING`, and the example queries the
agent is given all spell the camelCase form. A corpus carrying uppercase names
would import into a graph where every shipped query returns nothing.

Finally, ariel_standalone is asserted to seed the same corpus from its own
`data/` tree, byte for byte: the two presets ship two copies of one generated
file, and a regeneration that reaches only one of them would leave the two
demos describing different machines.
