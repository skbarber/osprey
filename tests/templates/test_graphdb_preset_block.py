"""Render test for the `services.graphdb` block in the shipped app presets.

The graph store is the one service whose declaration is *mandatory* when it is
deployed: a `graphdb` entry in `deployed_services` with no `services.graphdb`
block is refused before compose runs, because nothing else says which ports to
publish. A preset that emitted one half of that pair would therefore ship a
project that cannot come up — a failure every adopter hits on their first
`osprey up`, not a rare edge case.

So the pairing is pinned here for both presets that carry it, in both arms of
the `deploy_services` switch: on, and both halves are present; off (the attached
project, which connects to another project's stack), and neither is. The
last test closes the loop by running the preflight that does the refusing
against the rendered preset, so the guard fails if the block drifts into a shape
the deploy path would reject rather than merely into a shape that parses.

Values are pinned only where the schema module does *not* default them —
`path` and `ttl_path`, which no code fills in — plus the key set itself, which
is what pins the absent `password` key (the credential is minted into the
project `.env` as GRAPHDB_PASSWORD; one written here would be read by nobody).
Ports, image and the memory knobs are `graphdb_service.py` constants, already
covered by that module's own tests, and re-asserting them here would only
duplicate the pin.
