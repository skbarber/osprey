"""Render tests for the p4p (pvAccess) block in ``control-system-safety.md.j2``.

The EPICS connector reads pvAccess channels through ``p4p``, so the shipped
safety rule has to name that library the same way it names ``pyepics`` --
otherwise an agent steered off ``epics.caput`` simply reaches for
``Context.put`` instead. Two details matter enough to pin here:

* Both client flavors are named. ``p4p`` ships parallel ``thread`` and
  ``asyncio`` client classes, and a rule that mentions only the threaded one
  leaves the async spelling looking permissible.
* ``rpc`` is called out as refused rather than merely discouraged. Approval
  cannot mediate an arbitrary rpc payload, so the rule has to say the call is
  not approvable instead of letting the agent burn a round trip discovering it.

The block belongs to the EPICS-family branch only: ``epics`` and
``virtual_accelerator`` (a plain ``EPICSConnector`` subclass) get it, every
other control-system type is left untouched.
