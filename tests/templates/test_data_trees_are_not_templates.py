"""A bundle's ``data/`` tree is content, never templates.

``osprey init`` materializes ``apps/<bundle>/data/`` into a facility's
own profile source by literal copy, and ``osprey build`` copies a profile's
``data:`` root back out the same way. Neither side renders Jinja, so a ``.j2``
file staged under ``apps/*/data/`` would reach the built project with its
suffix intact and its placeholders unexpanded -- and the preset path, which
DOES render and strips the suffix, would land it under a different filename
than the profile path. Keeping data trees template-free is what makes the two
paths agree by construction.
