"""Byte-for-byte baseline for every bundled service template at its defaults.

Each template under the packaged ``templates/services/`` tree is rendered with
the axes UNSET — no ``network:``, no per-service overrides, an empty
``services.<name>`` block — through the same ``_inject_project_metadata``
context ``osprey up`` builds, and compared against a committed golden under
``render_defaults/``. The suite discovers templates by glob, so a newly bundled
service arrives here without anyone remembering to add it: it fails for want of
a golden rather than shipping unpinned.

What this pins that the substring tests around it cannot: those prove a
template's blocks piecewise, one assertion per block. Byte equality proves the
render is *only* those blocks — that a template edit did not also shift a
comment, drop a blank line, or reorder a stanza somewhere no assertion was
looking. The default render is the shape essentially every deployment gets, so
an unnoticed drift here reaches every adopter at once.

The baseline deliberately carries the deltas this feature introduced — the
``osprey.env.digest`` label on the two dispatch-pair services, and the worker's
``env_file:`` comment rewritten for the env chain. Those are pinned, not
tolerated: :func:`test_goldens_pin_the_env_chain_deltas` fails if a regeneration
quietly drops them.

**Update discipline** — read this before touching anything under
``render_defaults/``:

- A failure here means a template's default render changed. That is not
  automatically a bug, but it is never a reason to edit a golden by hand.
- Regenerate the whole set from the templates, in the SAME reviewed change as
  the template edit that moved them, so a reviewer sees the template diff and
  its rendered consequence side by side — never as a separate "make the test
  pass again" commit::

      PYTHONPATH=src ./.venv/bin/python tests/templates/test_render_defaults_golden.py

- Then read the golden diff. Every changed byte has to trace back to the
  template edit you just made. A byte you cannot account for is the bug this
  suite exists to catch.

The render-time values that differ per checkout — the deployment repo's path,
its identity hash, and the running framework version — are pinned to fixed
literals in the context (see the ``_PINNED_*`` constants) rather than
substituted at comparison time, so the goldens stay literal, readable files.
What derives those values in production is covered by the generator's own
tests; what this suite covers is what the templates do with them.

Nothing here is pinned per *run*: a render is a function of its context alone,
which is what :mod:`test_render_reproducible` asserts directly.
