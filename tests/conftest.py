#
# Importing a test module can import third-party code that loads a .env at
# import time — litellm calls dotenv.load_dotenv() on import, and python-dotenv
# walks UP from its package directory, so on a developer machine it can find an
# ancestor checkout's .env and inject real credentials, PROJECT_ROOT, and TZ
# into os.environ before the first test runs. CI has no ancestor .env, so
# whatever those variables change locally is invisible there.
#
# Only that injection is undone. A blanket restore would also strip the
# coordination variables some test modules legitimately export at import time
# (tests/va/* set EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT et al. so the soft-IOC subprocesses they
# spawn share their ports), so a key is removed only when it BOTH appeared
# during collection AND carries exactly the value an ancestor .env defines.

# import-time required because `osprey.cli.styles` builds its module-level
# Rich Console at import time and Rich reads FORCE_COLOR in `Console.__init__`,
# so a fixture runs too late to un-force a console that already exists: the
# color-forcing variables must be gone BEFORE collection imports any osprey
# module. A developer terminal that
# exports FORCE_COLOR otherwise turns CliRunner captures into ANSI-laced text
# and fails seven CLI tests on pristine main — CI is green only because its
# runners never export it. `NO_COLOR` is left alone: unset is the same default

    Leak guarded: ``configure_logging()`` (``src/osprey/utils/logger.py``) makes
    three process-global changes — it sets the root logger level, installs an
    Osprey ``RichHandler``, and raises six third-party loggers to WARNING. Any
    test that reaches an entry point triggers all three, and they would then
    decide what ``caplog`` sees in every test that ran after it on the same
    worker, including whether httpx/urllib3 records are captured at all.

    The baseline is ``_PRISTINE_LOGGING``, captured at conftest import, rather
    than a per-test snapshot. A per-test snapshot cannot see far enough back:
    pytest sets higher-scoped fixtures up *before* this function-scoped one, so
    a module-scoped fixture that configures logging is already reflected in the

    the worker. ``tests/cli/test_dockerfile_template.py`` runs the CLI from a
    module-scoped fixture and does exactly that.

    Only ``RichHandler`` instances are ever removed. ``caplog`` installs its
    ``LogCaptureHandler`` around each test, and anything a test or fixture owns
    itself, are left alone.

    The CLI adds a fourth process-global change: it installs its altitude gate
    (``osprey.cli.altitude``) as a filter on that ``RichHandler``, which decides
    what a run renders. A handler a test survives with — one that was already
    pristine, or one a fixture owns — would carry that gate into every later
