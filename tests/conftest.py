# walks UP from its package directory, so on a developer machine it can find an
# ancestor checkout's .env and inject real credentials, PROJECT_ROOT, and TZ
# into os.environ before the first test runs. CI has no ancestor .env, so
# whatever those variables change locally is invisible there.
#
# Only that injection is undone. A blanket restore would also strip the
# coordination variables some test modules legitimately export at import time
# (tests/va/* set EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT et al. so the soft-IOC subprocesses they
# spawn share their ports), so a key is removed only when it BOTH appeared
# during collection AND carries exactly the value an ancestor .env defines.

# import-time required because `osprey.cli.styles` builds its module-level
# Rich Console at import time and Rich reads FORCE_COLOR in `Console.__init__`,
# so a fixture runs too late to un-force a console that already exists: the
# color-forcing variables must be gone BEFORE collection imports any osprey
# module. A developer terminal that
# exports FORCE_COLOR otherwise turns CliRunner captures into ANSI-laced text

        ``OSPREY_POSTURE_SESSION`` and ``OSPREY_AGENT_DATA_ROOT``, which the web
        server always stamps as a pair. A developer running the suite from inside a
        narrowed session would otherwise hand every store-touching test a session
        key and an agent-data root no test asked for — and, worse, a test that
        redirects the store by patching ``resolve_shared_data_root`` would be
        silently inert, because ``session_store.agent_data_root()`` reads the
        variable FIRST and only falls back to the resolver.

    All three are CLEARED, not pointed elsewhere. Stamping a throwaway root here
        would look tidier — clearing the variable does not stop a write, it aims it
        at ``<repo>/var/agent_data`` via ``resolve_shared_data_root()`` — but the
        stamp is preferred over the resolver by both readers, so a suite-wide stamp
        silently overrides every test that redirects the root by patching
        ``resolve_shared_data_root``, which is most of them: measured, it turns 90
        tests across ``tests/mcp_server`` red and the whole hooks tree with it.
        The leak is therefore closed where it is caused — a test whose code writes
        under that root stamps its own — and kept closed by
        :func:`no_agent_data_in_the_repo` below, which fails the session if the run
        created the directory.

# Web-auth test seam
# ===================================================================
#
# ``WebAuthMiddleware`` is installed outermost on every interface app by
# ``configure_interface_app``, so every request a ``starlette.testclient``
# (a.k.a. ``fastapi.testclient``) ``TestClient`` — or an ``httpx.AsyncClient``
# wrapping an ``ASGITransport`` — makes is 401'd unless it carries a live
# operator credential. Hundreds of existing tests drive interface routes through
# these clients and predate the gate; they assert the route's own behaviour, not
# the absence of authentication. Rather than touch each of them, this seam makes
# every such client present the operator credential by default.
#
# Mechanism — request-time operator-secret injection, *not* a construction-time
# cookie. Two facts about the existing suite force this:
#
#   1. Some interface tests pin their own ``app.state.web_credentials`` (a fresh
#      :class:`WebCredentials` with a known operator secret) *after* the client
#      is constructed — ``tests/interfaces/web_terminal/test_proxy.py`` does. A
#      credential minted at client-construction time lands in the holder that
#      swap discards, so it never authenticates. Reading the holder on each
#      request, instead, always sees the live one.
#   2. The proxy-boundary tests attach *decoy* inbound headers (a wrong
#      ``X-Osprey-Terminal-Secret``, a stale cookie, a bearer) to prove the
#      proxy strips them. The gate checks the operator-secret header *first* and
#      refuses a wrong one outright, so a session cookie added alongside a decoy
#      secret header would never be reached. Overriding that header with the
#      process's real secret is the only thing that authenticates such a request.
#
# So the seam force-sets ``X-Osprey-Terminal-Secret`` (``OPERATOR_SECRET_HEADER``)
# to the operator secret held by the client's target app, per request, reading
# ``app.state.web_credentials`` at send time. This is the header path the task
# explicitly allows as the alternative to the cookie: the cookie path is the one
# real browsers use, but it cannot serve these two shapes, and the Origin/CSRF
# logic it would exercise is already covered directly by the raw-ASGI tests in
# ``tests/interfaces/test_auth_middleware.py``. The operator-secret header is not
# subject to the Origin check, so mutating and websocket requests pass too.
#
# The seam acts **only** on a client aimed at a gated interface app — one whose
# ``app.state.web_credentials`` is a real :class:`WebCredentials` (the object the
# gate reads, and the tell that ``configure_interface_app`` ran). A client aimed
# at any other ASGI app, or at a real network host, is left untouched. Both
# client shapes are covered: ``TestClient`` over HTTP *and* its
# ``websocket_connect`` handshake, and ``httpx.AsyncClient`` over ``ASGITransport``.
#
# Install is session-scoped so it wraps client fixtures of every scope — a
# module-scoped client is built before any function-scoped fixture would run.
# Opt-out is a per-test flag (``@pytest.mark.no_auth_seam``) the injection hooks
# read at send time, for the dedicated tests that assert an *unauthenticated*
# refusal through such a client. The raw-ASGI auth tests never build one, so they
# need no marker.

#: Flipped off by :func:`_auth_seam_optout` for a ``no_auth_seam`` test. Read by
#: the injection hooks at send time, so it governs even a client built by a
#: higher-scoped fixture and shared across tests.

    The env-driven population path (``web_auth._populate``) is decided once per
    process and is idempotent, so without this the first test in a worker would
    pin the operator secret for every test after it, and a test that mints a
    secret would leak it into its neighbours. Resetting both sides keeps the
    population testable in isolation. It does not clear ``app.state`` on an app
    built before the reset — such an app keeps the holder it cached. The root
    TestClient seam reads its secret from ``app.state``, so that app stays

    The baseline is ``_PRISTINE_LOGGING``, captured at conftest import, rather
    than a per-test snapshot. A per-test snapshot cannot see far enough back:
    pytest sets higher-scoped fixtures up *before* this function-scoped one, so
    a module-scoped fixture that configures logging is already reflected in the
    snapshot and would be preserved rather than undone, for every later test on
    the worker. ``tests/cli/test_dockerfile_template.py`` runs the CLI from a
    module-scoped fixture and does exactly that.

    Only ``RichHandler`` instances are ever removed. ``caplog`` installs its
    ``LogCaptureHandler`` around each test, and anything a test or fixture owns
    itself, are left alone.

    The CLI adds a fourth process-global change: it installs its altitude gate
    (``osprey.cli.altitude``) as a filter on that ``RichHandler``, which decides
    what a run renders. A handler a test survives with — one that was already
    pristine, or one a fixture owns — would carry that gate into every later
    test on the worker, so any gate is stripped as well.
