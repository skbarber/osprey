"""The audit-critical markers are not pinnable from a server spec.

An audit record answers three questions no facility may answer for itself:
*who* acted (the whole identity ladder — ``OSPREY_TERMINAL_USER`` and
``OSPREY_AUDIT_IDENTITY`` — plus ``OSPREY_AUDIT_WRITER``), *which posture* the
process is under (``OSPREY_EXECUTION_MODE``, the value the middleware clamp
and the executor gate both read) and *where the posture claim came from*
(``OSPREY_POSTURE_SOURCE`` and the exported session key
``OSPREY_POSTURE_SESSION``). Each is assigned by a real site outside the MCP
spec path — compose ``environment:`` for the identities, the three
web-terminal spawn sites for the posture and its provenance pair, the root
maintenance heredoc's per-command prefix for the writer. A spec's ``env:`` is
therefore never a legitimate source for any of them, and a spec that could set
one could file its records under another service's name, present a writes
posture inside a sandboxed session, or claim a posture provenance it was never
granted.

The set is spelled off its sources, not off a hand-picked list: two of the
containment tests below exist because the first cut listed four markers and
missed both the ladder's WINNING rung (a spec pinning ``OSPREY_TERMINAL_USER``
misrouted its whole ledger into an unmounted subdirectory) and the posture
value itself (a clone pinning ``OSPREY_EXECUTION_MODE=write_access`` ran write
tools through a sandboxed session and filed ``posture=writes`` for it).

The anti-spoof is post-merge REMOVAL at ``_server_to_dict``'s env loop — the
one site every launch path funnels through. That location is the whole point:
spec env WINS the merge everywhere upstream (an extends clone merges it over
the template, a custom server copies it verbatim), so a clone-path
``merged_env`` pop would leave custom servers wide open. These tests pin the
removal on all three launch paths, the operator-facing lint that says so, and
the constants' agreement with the modules that own the spellings.

The mirror property — ``OSPREY_MCP_TOOL_PREFIX`` is ASSIGNED at the same site,
not removed — lives in ``test_tool_prefix.py``; it is re-asserted here only
where the two settlements sit close enough to be swapped by accident.
