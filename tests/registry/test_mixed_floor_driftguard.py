"""Drift guards: the audit middleware's degraded-render floors, and the one
word three layers spell for a posture refusal, stay pinned to their sources of
truth.

``osprey.mcp_server.audit_middleware`` ships two hardcoded floor lists, used
only when a render cannot be trusted (missing/unreadable/malformed
``hook_config.json``):

- ``_FALLBACK_MIXED_TOOLS`` -- the read/write-mixed exception. Documented as
  always equal to the registry's ``MIXED_READ_WRITE_TEMPLATES``-derived
  matcher list (``registry.mcp.framework_mixed_read_write_tools()``).
- ``_FALLBACK_WRITE_TOOLS`` -- the pre-existing write-tool floor, documented
  as the same literal as the client-side hooks' shared floor,
  ``osprey_hook_log.FALLBACK_WRITE_TOOLS`` (which ``osprey_writes_check.py``
  and ``osprey_approval.py`` both read through ``write_tools()``). The two
  layers (server-side middleware, client-side hooks) must not disagree about
  what a degraded deployment refuses.

``tests/mcp_server/test_audit_middleware.py`` already asserts
``_FALLBACK_MIXED_TOOLS == framework_mixed_read_write_tools()`` and
``_FALLBACK_WRITE_TOOLS == <the hooks' shared literal>`` directly. This module is
the independent second guard the PLAN calls for: it re-derives the mixed
floor's expected value from ``FRAMEWORK_SERVERS``/``_WRITES_CHECK`` by hand,
without going through ``framework_mixed_read_write_tools()`` at all, so a bug
in that helper's own derivation cannot make both guards go green for the same
wrong reason. It also re-pins the write floor against the hooks' shared module
so this file alone is a complete driftguard for both floors, not just the
mixed one.

The write floor used to be pinned ONLY against the hooks' identical copy, and
that is how it went stale: it named ``controls`` and ``python``'s write-gated
tools but not bluesky's ``queue_add``/``queue_start``, on the argument that
bluesky is opt-in (``default_enabled=False``). That argument has it backwards
-- the deployments that can call ``queue_add`` are exactly the ones that opted
in -- and, worse, two identical copies pinned to each other agree happily while
both drift away from the registry, so the next framework write tool would be
stranded the same way. ``registry.mcp.framework_write_tools()`` is the derived
third answer both copies are now checked against here.

The posture-refusal reason is the same shape of problem in the record
vocabulary: the middleware, the executor's in-tool session clamp and the hook
all refuse a control-system write under the sandbox posture, and an operator
asking "what did the sandbox posture refuse for this user?" greps one word.
They must not answer in two dialects. The hook is pinned by AST for both
values, since it ships as a copied-in template file run by a bare ``python3``
and imports nothing from ``osprey``.

The operator-facing half of that refusal is the same problem again, one layer
up: each of those layers ends its refusal by naming where the posture is
lifted, and that surface MOVED — the session posture used to be a toggle on
the terminal card and is now the control-target chip in the header. A layer
left pointing at the old surface sends an operator looking for a control that
is not there, and nothing else would catch it, because each layer's own tests
assert only its own sentence.
