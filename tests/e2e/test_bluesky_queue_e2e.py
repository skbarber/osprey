"""Real-container end-to-end proof of the whole Bluesky *queue* stack.

This is the acceptance instrument for the queue-backed plan stack: a fresh
``osprey init`` + ``osprey build`` of the shipped ``control-assistant`` preset,
deployed with ``osprey up --dev``, driven through the surface an operator (or
the agent, or a panel) actually uses -- ``PATCH /draft`` -> ``POST /queue/items``
-> ``POST /queue/start`` -> ``GET /runs`` -> ``GET /runs/{id}/data`` -- against
real containers: the bluesky bridge, the ``bluesky-queueserver`` RE Manager,
its Redis, the co-deployed Tiled catalog, the Virtual Accelerator soft-IOC,
and the bluesky-web sidecar.

Why this file exists at all: every other test of this stack drives a *mocked*
queue client. Those cover OSPREY's half of a two-party contract. The manager,
Redis durability, the CurveZMQ control socket, the document plane, and the
capability record's dependence on the deployed connector are the other half,
and only a real deploy exercises them.

**The preset is the subject, not a fixture detail.** ``control-assistant``
baselines ``control_system.type`` on its live stand-in, so this module
deliberately does NOT override it (unlike ``tests/e2e/_orm_stack.py``, written
when ``mock`` was the default): stage 1 asserts the *shipped baseline* is the
executable one. The three ``--override`` entries and four ``--set`` ports are
host-hygiene only -- drop the event-dispatcher/web-terminal stacks this proof
never touches, and move every published port off the defaults so this can run
on a shared dev machine beside an already-deployed tutorial stack.

Stages, in order, each an independently-reportable test:

1. ``test_1_capability_*``       -- bridge ``/health`` and the sidecar's
   ``/bridge/health`` relay both report ``can_execute: true`` / ``executable``.
2. ``test_2_enqueue_*``          -- two grid scans from two draft revisions; a
   second enqueue of the SAME revision is refused ``draft_revision_already_launched``.
   ``test_2_preflight_*``        -- ``POST /plans/{name}/preview`` walks the plan
   in the real worker and moves nothing: the declared channels with their roles,
   the exact move total, the cap, and one answer shape even for an unknown plan.
3. ``test_3_start_*``            -- ``POST /queue/start`` is token-gated
   (``launch_token_required``), the queue drains STRICTLY SERIALLY, live rows
   accumulate at the poller's ~1 s cadence while a plan runs, and the started
   run publishes the point count its plan DECLARED.
4. ``test_4_results_*``          -- both runs' data reads back off the live
   buffer (``run_uid: null``, the live path), each carrying the six-key
   analysis block keyed on the plan's declared movable channel.
5. ``test_5_session_plan_*``     -- author -> validate (PASS + uploaded) ->
   stage in the draft -> enqueue -> drain, with the author's own channel roles
   and three-field metadata served back by the catalog; a session plan whose
   validated bytes no longer match disk is refused ``session_plan_unvalidated``;
   and a write carrying a retired metadata key is refused outright.
6. ``test_6_abort_*``            -- the emergency halt: a long run is aborted
   with NO token, its record reaches ``stopped``, the manager returns to a
   startable state, and an abort with nothing running is ``nothing_running``.
7. ``test_7_restart_*``          -- restarting ONLY the bridge preserves queue
   and history (they live in Redis, not in the bridge), the completed runs'
   data now serves off the DURABLE Tiled path (``run_uid`` populated), and that
   stored table exports as a real CSV and parquet file.
8. ``test_8_mock_flip_*``        -- ``osprey set connector=mock`` + rebuild +
   redeploy: every container still healthy, ``/health`` still 200 but
   ``can_execute: false`` / ``browse_only_connector``, and enqueue refused --
   a browse-only deployment never holds items it could never run.
9. ``test_9_security_*``         -- Redis is unreachable from ``osprey-network``;
   the queueserver CONTROL socket refuses a client without the server public
   key (the SOLE credential -- see below); and the document plane refuses a
   publisher with no client certificate.

**Refusals are asserted on ``detail.code``, never on the status code alone.**
Every refusal this stack emits is ``{"detail": {"code": <machine-readable>,
"detail": <sentence>, ...}}``; a status-code-only assertion passes while the
body drifts, which is exactly the class of regression this file is here to
catch.

**Ordering is load-bearing, and the fixture is module-scoped**: one build and
one deploy back every stage (a per-test deploy would take hours). Later stages
consume earlier ones' run ids through the module-level ``_S`` state object and
``pytest.skip`` when a prerequisite never happened, so a failure in stage 3
reports as one failure plus honest skips rather than eight cascading errors.
Stage 8 leaves the deployment on the mock connector on purpose -- it is the
last stage that needs an executable one, and stage 9's probes are connector-
independent.

**Not asserted, deliberately**: a bridge restart mid-run loses that run's live
rows until its next start document. That is CORRECT -- live rows are in-process
and the queue/history are the Redis-durable part -- so stage 7 restarts only
between runs and reads the completed runs back through Tiled.

**Control-socket credential model** (drives stage 9): the RE manager runs
``CURVE_SERVER=1`` with no authenticator and no client allowlist, while
``bluesky-queueserver-api``'s client authenticates with a FIXED keypair
compiled into the package. The server PUBLIC key is therefore the SOLE
credential for driving the queue -- which is why stage 9 probes the control
socket *without* it, and why that key must never reach panels, the sidecar, or
a log line.

CONTAINER SAFETY: every docker invocation below names an EXACT container,
image, or network belonging to this test's own project. Never a wildcard,
never ``system prune``. Teardown goes through the shipped ``osprey down``,
followed by exact-named removal of this project's own volumes
(``tests/e2e/_volumes.py``): ``down`` keeps them by design, and a rerun must
not inherit their state -- the queue itself lives in a Redis named volume.

Gating: needs Docker. Lives in ``tests/e2e/`` so the fast lane
(``pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e``) never collects this ~20-minute
build+deploy; run it by name --
``uv run pytest tests/e2e/test_bluesky_queue_e2e.py -v`` -- never with
``-m e2e`` (the marker selection leaks registries; see the repo convention).

    """Host hygiene and CI sizing ONLY -- never ``control_system.type``.

    ``dispatch: null`` drops the event-dispatcher stack (Node + Claude CLI
    image) and ``modules.web_terminals.enabled: false`` drops the per-persona
    web-terminal stack: neither is touched by this proof and both are slow to
    build (same convention as ``_orm_stack.override_yaml``). The two config port
    keys move ariel-postgres and OpenObserve -- services the preset deploys
    unconditionally, with no profile knob -- off 5432/5080, which a locally
    running tutorial deploy routinely holds.

    The archiver's MongoDB moves through ``va_archiver.port_host`` instead, and
    that difference is load-bearing: the archiver injector RENDERS
    ``services.mongodb.port_host`` from the profile block, so the same key set
    under ``config:`` here is written and then silently overwritten -- the
    deploy still tries to publish 27017 and `osprey up`'s port preflight aborts
    the whole stack. Only the host publish moves; both compose templates address
    the store in-network as ``archiver-mongodb:27017`` regardless.

    ``_orm_stack.VA_ARCHIVER_CI_KNOBS`` shrinks the archive the preset's
    ``va_archiver:`` block declares (see the constant). It is a sizing override,
    not a behavioral one: the store and its recorder still deploy, still record,
    and still hold both tiers -- there is just far less seeded history to write
    first, none of which this proof reads. Nothing here touches what the stack
    IS, which is the property the docstring above is about: this module inherits
    ``control_system.type`` from the preset on purpose, so that a preset that
    stopped baselining on an executable machine would fail these stages rather
    than be papered over here.

    Written as flat dotted-string keys under ``config:`` (the preset's own

      run.

    ``progress`` is asserted only where it is PRESENT: an absent progress
