"""E2E: the container privilege split, over both shipped topologies.

Every assertion here is made against a **real image built from a real
``osprey build`` render**, because the split is a filesystem fact and nothing
short of the built image can report it. A unit test can prove the Dockerfile
template emits a ``chown`` line; only ``stat`` inside the container proves the
line landed on the file it names, in the layer order that makes it stick.

Two renders of the ``control-assistant`` preset are built (one ``osprey init``
+ ``osprey build``, which renders the deployment's own project AND one per
persona delta):

* the **base render** — the single-user, restricted tier. Its permission render
  denies ``setup_patch``, so the Dockerfile's ``is_setup_patch_capable`` branch
  is absent and ``build/config.yml`` stays root-owned.
* the **admin render** (``<repo>-admin``) — the one tier that lifts the floor.
  Its ``build/config.yml`` is chowned to the agent's user, which is what keeps
  the Config panel's write alive without opening the rest of the render zone.

What each group pins:

``TestReadOnlyRenderZone`` — the render zone is the agent's ceiling. The
config the agent runs under is root-owned and unwritable by ``osprey``; the
state zone (``var/audit``) it must write is writable; the server the image
actually starts runs as uid 1000; and the entrypoint demonstrably ran and
dropped privileges before it did.

``TestAdminTierConfigWrites`` — the admin tier's config write across the
split: the agent's user really can rewrite the one file this tier hands it
(through the framework's own writer, not ``touch``), and a container restart
is what re-renders ``.claude/settings.json`` from it — as root, in the
entrypoint, into a tree the serving process cannot write.

``TestScaffoldRestoreReservedGate`` — a poisoned ownership record on the
agent-writable claude-config volume must not become a file in the render zone.
One test pins the gate itself; the other pins the shipped entrypoint path.

**This suite found two real defects in the built image, and now pins their
fixes.** Both were carried here as strict xfails until they were fixed:

1. ``PATCH /api/config`` 500'd in the shipped admin image
   (``Permission denied: '/app/<project>/build/var'``), so the admin Config
   panel could not save at all. The relocated backup was anchored on the RENDER
   dir while ``agent_data.base_dir`` is rendered relative to the repo ROOT,
   which is where the Dockerfile creates and chowns the zone. The backup scheme
   now derives its anchor from the config file itself
   (``config_writer.config_backup_path`` → ``repo_root_for_config``), so no
   caller can hand it the render.
2. The entrypoint's scaffold restore was a no-op, because running it as root
   flipped ``resolve_ownership`` from ``VOLUME`` (what the app sees as uid
   1000) to ``PROFILE`` — the durable store was never read, and the
   reserved-path gate never ran on the root path it was written to guard.
   ``resolve_ownership`` now skips the baked profile outright on a container
   render (``OSPREY_RENDER_ZONE_READONLY=1``), so root and the server resolve
   the same surface.

Neither is xfailed any more; ``test_config_patch_saves_and_backs_up_into_the_state_zone``
and ``test_the_entrypoint_restore_refuses_a_reserved_record`` are the pins.

``TestMultiUserSeeding`` — the per-user seeding target and its owners: skills
land in the render zone at ``<container_project_dir>/build/.claude/skills``
(the only scope the launcher's ``--setting-sources project`` actually loads),
root-owned so a session cannot edit the skills the next session reads, while
the claude-config volume is handed to the runtime uid.

Cost discipline: TWO images, built from one shared ``osprey init`` + ``osprey
build``, as module-scoped fixtures. Everything above the deployment ``COPY``
is byte-identical between the two renders, so the second build reuses the
first's layer cache and costs a ``COPY`` plus two ``RUN``s.

The images are built for the HOST platform, unlike ``test_dockerfile_e2e.py``
which pins linux/amd64 on arm64 hosts. That pin is for a dependency-wheel
availability problem; these tests assert file ownership and uids, which are
architecture-independent, and a native build is what ``osprey up`` produces on
the same host — emulating a second architecture would only add a cold layer
cache to a suite that already builds two images.

        For the whole of the container split's life before this, the entrypoint
        resolved its ownership surface by asking whether it could write the
        profile root — and as root, inside an image whose ``profile.yml`` really
        is there, the answer was yes. It took the PROFILE branch, never read the
        volume, and reported ``no user-owned artifact bodies to restore`` while
        the store held them. The app never made up the difference: it skips the
        restore entirely under ``OSPREY_RENDER_ZONE_READONLY=1``. So a claimed
        body was silently lost on every container recreation, and the refusal
        test above passed the entire time — nothing was installed because
        nothing was read.

        The restored file is ROOT-owned, and that is the intended posture, not
        an oversight. It lands in the render zone, whose defining property is
        that the agent's user cannot write it: an artifact the operator claimed
        must not become the one file in that tree the agent can rewrite. The

    """Seed one roster user's live container, exactly as ``osprey up`` does.

    The admin image is reused rather than a third one built: carol is the
    roster's admin-persona user, so her resolved ``container_project_dir`` IS
    this image's project by construction — which keeps the seeding assertions
    on the real catalog and the real roster instead of a hand-made config.

    The container is named the way the compose service names it, because
    ``seed_user_containers`` finds its target by that name and nothing else —
    so the name is made unique by giving the seeding a config whose
    ``facility.prefix`` is unique to this run. The preset pins a FIXED prefix
    (``ca``), which means the compose-dictated name ``ca-web-carol`` collides
    with any real deployment of this preset on the developer's own machine; a
    developer running one would otherwise silently lose this whole class to a
    skip. Overriding the prefix keeps both properties: the test never touches a
    container it did not create, and it always runs.

    Only carol's persona is seeded, and it names its own ``project``, so the
    prefix override cannot reach the project path — ``facility.prefix`` feeds
    ``resolve_personas`` solely as the default for a persona that names none.
