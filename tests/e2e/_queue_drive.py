"""One copy of the queue flow every real-stack e2e uses to run a plan.

The bridge has no direct-execute route any more: ``POST /runs`` and
``POST /runs/{id}/launch`` both answer 410 ``use_the_queue``. Running a plan is
now four steps -- stage it in the shared draft, enqueue the exact revision that
was staged, arm the queue with the launch token, poll the run record -- and
this module is the single place they are spelled out, so a change to the flow
lands in one file rather than in every deploy proof that happens to run a plan.

``tests/e2e/test_bluesky_queue_e2e.py`` deliberately does NOT import this: that
module is the acceptance instrument for the queue surface itself, and a proof
of the flow must not be written in terms of a helper that assumes it. Every
OTHER e2e -- the ones whose subject is a substrate, a plan, or a physics
round trip, and for which the queue is merely transport -- should use this.

WHY EACH STEP IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS:

* The draft is CLEARED before it is staged. A ``PATCH /draft`` that changes
  nothing is a documented no-op: no revision bump. Re-running the same plan
  with the same arguments (which is exactly what ``pytest.mark.flaky`` does on
  a rerun) would therefore hand back the revision the first attempt already
  consumed, and the enqueue would be refused ``draft_revision_already_launched``
  -- a confusing failure with nothing to do with the code under test. Deleting
  first makes every stage a genuine plan-change, so the revision always moves.
* The pending queue is DRAINED before staging. ``POST /queue/start`` starts the
  whole queue, not one item, and the queue lives in a Redis named volume that
  ``osprey down`` deliberately keeps -- so a previous run's leftovers would go
  back on the hardware under this run's start. Removal goes through the
  bridge's own ``DELETE /queue/items/{uid}``, never into Redis.
* The enqueue is UNARMED (no token). The queue is idle at that point, so an
  added item just sits there until the armed start -- the designed
  compose-now/arm-later split.

``wait_for_worker_environment`` is the one piece here that belongs to a deploy
FIXTURE rather than to the flow: it is the readiness gate an enqueue depends on
and that ``/health`` does not give you. See its docstring.

    """Block until the manager reports an OPEN RE worker environment.

    The gate every deploy fixture in this suite owes its own enqueue. HTTP
    readiness on ``/health`` does NOT imply it: the bridge opens the worker
    environment in a background task that is deliberately excluded from
    readiness (device connect takes tens of seconds), so a stack can answer 200
    with an empty worker namespace. ``POST /queue/items`` validates against
    ``plans_allowed``, which the manager downloads from the worker only when
    that environment opens -- so enqueueing too early is refused 409 "not in
    the list of allowed plans", a message that reads like a permissions problem
    and is nothing of the sort (the shipped ``user_group_permissions.yaml``
    allows ``[":.*"]``; the list was empty because the namespace was).

    ``manager_state`` is NOT the signal to wait on. It reads ``idle`` both
    before the environment has ever been opened and after it is up, so gating
    on it would be very nearly vacuous. ``worker_environment_exists`` is the
    one field that separates the two.

    ``worker_environment_exists`` alone is necessary but NOT sufficient: it
    flips true the moment the worker process is up, while ``plans_allowed``
    is filled in on a separate, later path -- the manager notices the open
    environment on a poll, downloads the worker's plan and device lists, and
    only then recomputes what is allowed. An enqueue landing in that window
    is refused with exactly the 409 this gate exists to prevent. So a second
    phase polls ``GET /devices`` until the ``devices`` array of its paginated
    envelope is non-empty: the manager assigns its allowed-plans and
    allowed-devices lists in one synchronous body (plans first), so a
    non-empty device page proves ``plans_allowed`` has already landed. Every
    substrate ships at least one device, so "non-empty" is the right bar.

    Returns the manager status document that satisfied the wait. Raises
    ``AssertionError`` naming the last thing seen -- a failure here says the
    worker environment (or its plan list) never came up, which points at the
    queueserver rather than at the plan the caller was about to run.
