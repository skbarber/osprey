"""Phase 2 acceptance proof: run data survives a Bluesky bridge restart via
the co-deployed Tiled catalog (PROPOSAL.md's success criterion 11).

Deploys the queue stack -- bridge + ``bluesky-queueserver`` RE Manager + Redis
+ Tiled -- against the Virtual Accelerator, drives ONE plan run to completion
through the queue (``PATCH /draft`` -> ``POST /queue/items`` -> token-gated
``POST /queue/start``), restarts ONLY the bridge container, and reads the same
run back through the same agent-facing endpoint (``GET /runs/{run_id}/data``).

The soft IOC is not incidental here. Plans execute in the queueserver worker
against real devices, so the ONLY connector that can produce a run with data is
one that can actually move something -- which is also why the shipped
``control-assistant`` preset baselines ``control_system.type`` on its live
stand-in, a soft IOC the deployment runs for itself. The mock connector would
give a browse-only deployment that refuses the enqueue outright, and there
would be nothing to round-trip.

The live-row buffer is in-process: it dies with the bridge. So after the restart
the only thing that can make this read return anything is the durable Tiled
catalog, found via the ``osprey_run_id`` the enqueue path stamps into the queue
item's metadata (``queue_backend.RUN_ID_META_KEY``), which reaches the
RunEngine start document and is searched for by ``_from_tiled`` once the live
lookup misses. ``run_uid`` is the tell: it is ``null`` on the live path (the
bridge holds a buffer but never learned the uid the worker's RunEngine minted)
and POPULATED on the Tiled path (it is on the stored start document), so this
test asserts the read genuinely switched sources rather than merely returning
the same numbers.

This is why the pre-restart poll waits for ``status == "completed"``, not merely
"running": ``TiledWriter`` caches events and flushes only at the stop doc (or
its own ``batch_size`` cap), so restarting before completion would lose every
cached event -- a proof that would pass vacuously. (Relatedly, and deliberately
NOT asserted anywhere here: a bridge restarted MID-run legitimately has no live
buffer for that run until its next start document. That is correct behavior,
not a gap.)

Scope, versus ``tests/e2e/test_bluesky_queue_e2e.py``: that module is the broad
proof of the whole queue stack (capability, arming, serial drain, session
plans, abort, browse-only, network isolation) and it exercises this same
durability path as one stage among nine. THIS module is the narrow, strict
acceptance proof of criterion 11 alone -- one plan run, one restart, byte-identical
read-back -- and keeps no flaky marker anywhere, so the criterion can never be
swept into a lenient rerun. Keep it that way if the two ever diverge.

Container safety: every docker invocation below names an exact container or
image -- never a wildcard, never ``system prune``/``--volumes``. Teardown
goes through ``osprey down``, never a raw ``docker rm`` sweep, followed by
exact-named removal of this project's own volumes (``tests/e2e/_volumes.py``):
``down`` keeps them by design, and a rerun must not inherit their state. The restart step
names the ``<project>-bluesky-bridge`` container only; ``osprey restart`` is
never used here because it bounces every service, including Tiled and the RE
manager, which would defeat the whole proof.

Markers: no ``pytest.mark.flaky`` anywhere in this module -- this file's
entire body IS the acceptance proof, so the round-trip assertions must stay
strict (mirrors ``test_va_substrate_equivalence.py``'s P5 convention: the
safety/acceptance proof is never swept into lenient reruns).
