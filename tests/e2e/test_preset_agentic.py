"""Tier 3 agentic per-preset smoke tests.

One canonical workflow per preset. Each test:
  1. Builds a deployment repo from the preset (with --skip-deps for speed;
     Tier 1 covers the real-build path).
  2. Asks an agent (via the Claude Agent SDK) to perform the canonical task.
  3. Asserts the right MCP tool appears in the tool trace (the contract that
     would catch a "preset config drift means the agent never reaches for
     the documented tool" failure).
  4. Optionally has the LLM judge evaluate the response.

Budget per test: max_turns=4, max_budget_usd=0.25, target wall-clock <5 min.
Gating in CI (agentic-per-preset blocks the merge like every other e2e lane);
coverage of the "is the tool wired up at all?" contract comes from Tier 0+1.
