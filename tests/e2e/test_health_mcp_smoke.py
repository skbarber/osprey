"""Agentic e2e acceptance gate for the system-health MCP server.

The health MCP server is opt-in (``claude_code.servers.health.enabled: true``);
the ``control_assistant`` preset turns it on and defaults to a mock control
system. This test is the end-to-end proof that the *poll tier* is wired all the
way through: a deployment built from that preset, driven by a real agent session
with an operator-style prompt, reaches for ``mcp__health__health_check`` on its
own and gets back a result that parses as the locked wire contract.

Design notes:
  * Operator-style prompt only — it asks whether the machine is healthy right
    now and does *not* name the tool, the server, any category name, or any
    JSON key. If a natural operator prompt fails to reach the tool, that is a
    real wiring/tool-description finding, to be fixed in the framework, never by
    steering the prompt toward the tool.
  * Poll tier ONLY. The test never invokes or depends on ``health_check_full``
    (that tool is approval-gated; e2e must not depend on approval flows).
  * ``@flaky(reruns=2)`` mirrors the other multi-step agentic e2e tests
    (e.g. ``test_rf_cavity_correlation_scenario``) to absorb rare stochastic
    LLM misses without weakening the contract.

Budget: max_turns=4, max_budget_usd=0.25 (per the preset-agentic convention).
