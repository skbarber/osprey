"""Out-of-process host-side Channel Access op for the substrate-equivalence e2e.

Runs ONE ``connect -> (optional confirmed write) -> read`` sequence against the
co-deployed Virtual Accelerator through the real, unmodified
``VirtualAcceleratorConnector`` (built by the production ``ConnectorFactory``),
prints the result as one marker-prefixed JSON line, then force-exits.

Why a subprocess per proof (mirrors P2's ``sweep_check`` subprocess): repeated
CA-context create/destroy cycles in a single process eventually trip a libca
teardown assertion (``assert(this->pudpiiu)``, ``cac.cpp``, thread
``CAC-TCP-send``) in ``EPICS_CA_NAME_SERVERS``-only mode -- a known
pyepics/libca quirk on the CA-circuit teardown path, unrelated to the connector
or the substrate: the read/write round trip completes and is correct *before*
it fires (see ``scripts/va/probe_roundtrip.py``'s "KNOWN FINDING"). Isolating
each proof's host CA work in its own process -- which emits its result and
``os._exit()``s *before* any connector disconnect / CA teardown runs -- means
the fault can never recur in the pytest process.

Deliberately never calls ``connector.disconnect()`` and never lets the
interpreter shut down normally: the whole point is to skip the CA-circuit
teardown that carries the assertion. All CA work is finished once the values
are in hand; ``os._exit(0)`` hands the socket back to the OS untorn.

Protocol -- ``argv[1]`` is a JSON spec::

    {"connector_config": {...},          # the ConnectorFactory connector config
     "config_overrides": {...},          # osprey.utils.config.get_config_value overrides
     "read": "<address>",                # the readback address to return
     "write": {"address": "<addr>", "value": <float>} | null,
     "settle_read": <bool>}              # poll the read until it == write.value (sp-echo)

On success, emits exactly one stdout line::

    __HOST_CA_RESULT__{"read_value": <float>, "read_settled": <bool>,
                       "write_outcome": <str|null>,
                       "write_error_message": <str|null>}

``write_outcome`` is the ``WriteOutcome`` word the connector reported, or
``null`` when no write was asked for. The word rather than a bool: on a
container flake the caller has to be able to tell a refusal from a mismatch
from a re-read that failed, and ``write_error_message`` carries the reason the
outcome came with (``null`` for the outcomes that carry none).

``read_settled`` is ``true`` when ``settle_read`` was not requested, or when the
readback reached the written value within the settle deadline; ``false`` means
the asynchronous echo never propagated in time (the caller should fail loudly).

Exit 0 on success; a non-zero exit (or a native SIGBUS) means the host CA op
failed and the caller must surface it -- never silently pass.
