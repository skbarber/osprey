"""Real-container ``grid_scan`` round-trip e2e (task 1.4 / PROPOSAL.md FR7).

Crown re-architects scan-plan registration to a single gold-standard registry
whose shipped set is exactly ``{orm, grid_scan}`` (FR2) — ``grid_scan`` is the
shipped ``plans_core/grid_scan.py`` file, whose canonical ``PLAN_METADATA``
name is ``"grid_scan"`` (see that module's docstring).
Its *agentic* scenario is explicitly deferred (PROPOSAL.md's Out of Scope —
it waits on a separate VA physics enhancement), so this non-agentic HTTP-level
round trip is what keeps the plan itself verified end to end in the meantime
(Secondary Goal 2): ``GET /plans`` -> ``PATCH /draft`` -> ``POST /queue/items``
-> armed ``POST /queue/start`` -> poll -> ``GET /runs/{id}/data`` (the queue
flow, spelled once in ``tests/e2e/_queue_drive.py``), mirroring
``test_orm_roundtrip.py``'s pattern
(task 5.2) but driving ``grid_scan`` instead of ``orm``, and without that
test's model-oracle cross-check (``grid_scan`` has no physics model to
compare against — it wraps ``bluesky.plans.grid_scan`` generically).

Proves two things end to end:

  (a) the deployed plan produces a well-formed rectangular-grid result: a
      column for the swept corrector, a column for the read BPM, and exactly
      ``num_points`` rows (one axis, so the grid is 1-D here) — the product
      of each axis's ``num_points`` per ``plans_core/grid_scan.py``'s own
      contract.
  (b) the swept corrector's readback actually visits every distinct
      commanded grid point (not stuck at one value) -- the same class of
      corrector-echo regression ``test_orm_roundtrip.py`` guards against,
      applied to `grid_scan`'s ``bps.mv``-driven axis instead of ``orm``'s
      current sweep.

Reuses ``tests/e2e/_orm_stack.py`` (task 4.3's single source of this deploy
shape) for the build/deploy scaffold and the channel-limits-derived
corrector/BPM selection -- no hardcoded preset channel, no re-derived deploy
logic.

Container safety: every docker invocation below names an exact
container/image -- never a wildcard, never ``system prune``/``--volumes``.
Teardown goes through ``osprey down``, matching every other e2e in
this directory, followed by exact-named removal of this project's own volumes
(``tests/e2e/_volumes.py``): ``down`` keeps them by design, and a rerun must
not inherit their state.

Gating: needs Docker; the VA image builds natively for the host arch, so on
Apple Silicon PyAT/softioc compile from source (no prebuilt aarch64 wheels) --
slow (minutes) on a cold image cache. On CI this runs in the dedicated
``orm-roundtrip-e2e`` job, after ``test_orm_roundtrip.py`` and never
alongside it -- both stand up their own VA on CA port 5064. Run locally
with ``E2E_REUSE_IMAGES=1`` set for fast iteration once the image cache is
warm.
