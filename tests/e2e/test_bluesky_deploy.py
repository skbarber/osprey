"""Full-stack Docker proof of the MINIMUM bluesky deploy: bridge + RE manager
+ Redis, and nothing else.

Mirrors ``tests/e2e/test_dispatch_deploy.py``'s shape (real ``osprey init`` +
``osprey build`` + ``osprey up --dev``, real containers, real HTTP calls
against the shipped artifacts). Unlike the dispatch worker, nothing here shells out to an
LLM, so this test needs no provider API key — ``hello-world``'s bundled
``provider``/``model`` defaults are enough for the build to succeed.

**Scope, and how it differs from ``test_bluesky_queue_e2e.py``.** That module
is the full-stack proof: Virtual Accelerator, Tiled, the bluesky-web sidecar, real
plan runs driven to completion, aborts, restarts. THIS module deliberately deploys
the smallest thing the ``bluesky:`` profile block can produce — one bridge, one
``bluesky-queueserver`` RE Manager, one Redis — on the ``hello-world`` preset,
whose ``control_system.type`` is ``mock``. What that buys, and what nothing
else covers:

  * the queue stack boots at all with no VA, no Tiled and no sidecar to lean
    on (a missing ``depends_on`` guard or a template block that only renders
    when the VA is co-deployed would surface here first);
  * a BROWSE-ONLY deployment is a HEALTHY deployment — every container reaches
    ``healthy``, ``/health`` answers 200, and the capability record carries the
    honest ``can_execute: false`` / ``browse_only_connector`` rather than the
    service going red;
  * that deployment refuses to hold queue items it could never run.

``hello-world`` (not ``control-assistant``) is still the right preset for that:
control-assistant ships a ``dispatch:`` block, the VA, Tiled, the sidecar and
the web-terminal stack by default, all of which would be built and deployed for
no reason — ``_inject_bluesky`` only *adds* to ``deployed_services``, it does
not replace what a preset already declares. ``hello-world`` declares no
services of its own, so the bluesky stack ends up as the ONLY thing deployed.

The bluesky stack is opt-in via profile, so the build supplies a ``bluesky:``
block explicitly. It does so by pinning ``bluesky.port`` (BRIDGE_PORT below)
rather than by letting the bridge take its slot in the deployment's port block,
since this is a shared dev machine and the bridge's port collided with an
unrelated pre-existing process during development of this test.

Asserts, against the REAL deployed containers:
  * the bridge binds to 127.0.0.1 (never 0.0.0.0) — ``docker port`` inspection.
  * BLUESKY_LAUNCH_TOKEN and the queueserver control-plane keypair were minted
    into the repo's ``.env``, and the manager's control socket answers.
  * the built image contains the unreleased bluesky modules — NOT merely that
    the image builds, since a PyPI-based build would silently lack them and
    this must fail loudly rather than pass on stale code. Importing them also
    exercises the bluesky/queueserver stack, which must be present for the
    manager's worker.
  * ``/health`` reports a browse-only capability, and enqueue is refused.

CONTAINER SAFETY: every docker/podman invocation below names an exact
container/image — never a wildcard, never ``system prune``/``--volumes``.
Teardown goes through ``osprey down`` (the shipped compose teardown path), not
a raw ``docker rm``/``rmi`` sweep, followed by exact-named removal of this
project's own volumes (``tests/e2e/_volumes.py``): ``down`` keeps them by
design, and a rerun must not inherit their state.

Gating: needs Docker. Skipped entirely if unavailable. Lives in ``tests/e2e/``
(not ``tests/integration/``) so the fast lane (``pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e``,
see ``ci_check.sh``/``premerge_check.sh``/ci.yml's ``test`` job) never collects
this real-container build+deploy; it runs instead in its own
``bluesky-deploy-e2e`` CI job (mirrors ``dispatch-deploy-e2e``'s setup, minus the
LLM secret/pre-flight probe this test doesn't need).
