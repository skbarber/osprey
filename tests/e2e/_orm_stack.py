"""Reusable turn-key plan-stack deploy configuration (task 4.3 / PROPOSAL FR11).

Builds the shipped deploy config that brings up the Virtual Accelerator +
Bluesky bridge + co-deployed Tiled catalog with
``control_system.type=virtual_accelerator`` and the ``bluesky`` MCP server
enabled (``default_enabled=False`` in the framework registry; opted in here
via ``claude_code.servers.bluesky.enabled``). ``BLUESKY_LAUNCH_TOKEN`` is
minted unconditionally by ``osprey up``, so no execution-method
override is needed to get the agent armed. Corrector
setpoints and BPM readbacks are wired into ``BLUESKY_EPICS_SETPOINTS``/
``_READBACKS`` from the *built* project's own ``channel_limits.json`` --
never a hardcoded preset channel (mirrors
``tests/e2e/test_va_substrate_equivalence.py``'s ``_select_sp_echo_pairs``,
restricted here to correctors/BPMs specifically since the ORM plan sweeps
correctors and reads BPMs, not arbitrary writable setpoints).

Not a test module itself (no ``test_`` functions) -- the single source of
this config for:
  * ``tests/deployment/test_compose_generator.py``'s ``orm_stack`` render
    gate (this task, Docker-free, via ``build_via_cli_runner``),
  * the real-container round-trip e2e (task 5.2, ``test_orm_roundtrip.py``),
  * the agentic-discovery e2e (tasks 5.3/5.4),
via ``build_project_subprocess`` + ``select_correctors``/``select_bpms``/
``write_substrate_env``.

Building this config never touches Docker by itself -- only a subsequent
``osprey up`` does (left to each caller, since only the real e2e/agentic
tests need a live stack).

``select_correctors``/``select_bpms``/``write_substrate_env`` delegate to the
canonical derivation in
``osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.substrate_devices`` (the single source of
this logic, also used by ``osprey up`` to auto-configure a VA-backed
plan stack's ``.env`` -- see ``container_lifecycle._ensure_bluesky_substrate_env``).
This module keeps its own public API/signatures/defaults unchanged so every
existing e2e importer is unaffected.

) -> None:
    """Restart ONLY the bluesky-bridge container of a deployed stack, then wait
    for it to answer ``/health`` again.

    Why an e2e needs this: the bridge holds a run's rows in an in-process ring
    buffer (``live_rows``), and nothing an HTTP client can call empties it --
    ``live_rows._clear()`` is in-process, and eviction needs 50 further runs.
    Restarting the process is the only way a test can drop that buffer and so
    force the read paths (``/runs/{id}/data``, ``/runs/{id}/figure``) onto their
    Tiled branch. Everything else keeps running: the queueserver, its Redis, the
    Tiled catalog and the Virtual Accelerator are untouched, so the completed
    run's documents are still in the catalog and the plan stack is still
    deployed.

    Restarting the bridge cannot lose documents, because the bridge is not what
    writes them: the ``TiledWriter`` subscription lives in the QUEUESERVER
    WORKER (``qserver_startup``), on the other side of this restart. What dies
    with the bridge process is its READ-side live buffer, which is exactly the
    state a test wants gone.

    WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. The health wait proves the bridge
    process is UP and serving. It says nothing about TiledWriter having flushed
    the run to the catalog -- that is a separate, asynchronous fact. A caller
    that needs the Tiled branch to actually answer must poll for it (a bounded
    poll on the route it cares about until ``source == "tiled"``), never infer
    it from this function returning. That poll belongs to the caller, whose
    route knows what "answered from Tiled" looks like -- see
    ``test_orm_roundtrip.py``, which waits on ``/runs/{id}/figure`` reporting
    both ``source == "tiled"`` and ``partial == false``.

    Nor does it restore enqueue readiness: the RE worker environment is opened
    by the bridge off its readiness path, so a caller that goes on to enqueue
    after a restart must re-wait via ``_queue_drive.wait_for_worker_environment``.

    Container safety: the compose invocation is pinned to THIS deployment's
    project (``-p <project>``, resolved exactly as the deploy pins
    ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME``) and names one exact service, so it can never reach
    another session's containers. No ``-f`` is passed: compose resolves the
    project from the running containers' own labels, which is what makes this a
    one-service operation on a live stack rather than a re-read of a render.

    :param project_name: The name the stack was built/deployed under (the raw
        name, as passed to ``build_project_subprocess``) -- the compose project
        and container names are derived from it here.
    :param bridge_url: The bridge's base URL, e.g. ``http://localhost:18102``.
        ``/health`` is appended to it.
    :param health_timeout: Seconds to wait for ``/health`` after the restart.
    :raises AssertionError: if the restart fails, if the container was not
        actually replaced, or if ``/health`` does not come back.
