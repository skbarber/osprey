"""Real-container sandbox-escape e2e (task 2.10) -- the authoritative proof of
the authoring-sandbox feature's central invariant: an agent-authored
session-tier plan can never reach real hardware unless it is validated AND
that exact validated content is what actually launches.

Deploys the VA-backed turn-key plan-stack (``tests/e2e/_orm_stack.py`` -- the
same real Virtual Accelerator + bluesky-bridge container pair
``test_orm_roundtrip.py`` uses) and drives the session-authoring HTTP surface
(``POST /plans/session``, ``POST /plans/validate``, then the queue path
``PATCH /draft`` -> ``POST /queue/items`` -> ``POST /queue/start``) end to end
against it, then reads a real corrector setpoint back
over Channel Access -- from this test process, independent of the bridge --
to prove a rejected write never lands, not merely that the bridge's own HTTP
responses claim it didn't.

Mocked-client tests (``tests/services/bluesky_bridge/test_plan_validation.py``,
``test_session_load_gate.py``, ``test_launch_validation_gate.py``) only
exercise OSPREY's own half of this contract in-process. This is the other
half: a real deployed bridge container, a real deployed IOC, and an
independent CA read that never goes through the bridge at all.

CRITICAL INTEGRATION CONTRACT (see ``plan_validation.py``'s module docstring
and the P5 Phase 2 research digest): the bytes ``validate_plan``
hashes for its validation record must be byte-identical to what the session
directory's load gate and the ENQUEUE gate (validation.py, called
from the queue's ``POST /queue/items``) re-hash from
disk. ``POST /plans/session`` writes the body once; ``POST /plans/validate``
re-reads and hashes that SAME file -- never a body passed separately -- so
"validated bytes == file bytes" is structural here, not a test convention
this e2e has to arrange for itself.

LOAD-BEARING SECURITY ASSUMPTION -- read before touching this file's
obfuscation-residual test: the stage-1/stage-2 static validator (AST import
walk + CA/connector substring-and-regex pattern scan) is NOT a containment
boundary. A sufficiently obfuscated body (reflected ``__import__``, a
getattr'd/concatenated attribute name for the call itself) can evade both
stages by construction -- neither stage's source text or AST ever contains a
literal "epics"/"caput" token for such a body. This is the DOCUMENTED,
ACCEPTED residual (task 2.1's ``TestKnownObfuscationResidual``, xfail,
strict) -- the real backstop for this exact case is human approval
RENDERING THE PLAN SOURCE at launch (task 2.6), not this validator, not the
session-layer load gate, not this test. ``test_obfuscated_residual_is_a_
documented_known_uncaught_case`` below records that case; it does NOT assert
the sandbox catches it -- doing so would misrepresent what the feature
actually guarantees.

Container safety: every docker invocation here names an exact
container/image -- never a wildcard, never ``system prune``/``--volumes``.
Teardown goes through ``osprey down``, matching every other e2e in
this directory, followed by exact-named removal of this project's own volumes
(``tests/e2e/_volumes.py``): ``down`` keeps them by design, and a rerun must
not inherit their state. ``BRIDGE_PORT`` below is distinct from every sibling e2e
module's pinned port; the VA's Channel Access port is NOT freely overridable
(see ``_orm_stack.VA_CA_PORT``'s docstring) so this test shares that fixed
port with ``test_orm_roundtrip.py``/``test_va_substrate_equivalence.py`` --
safe sequentially (each tears its own container down by exact name before
the next starts), not intended to run concurrently with them on one host.

Gating: needs Docker; the VA image is amd64-only (PyAT/softioc have no
aarch64 wheels), so it builds/boots under QEMU emulation on Apple Silicon --
as heavy as ``test_va_substrate_equivalence.py``. Advisory CI lane (see
ci.yml's ``bluesky-sandbox-escape-e2e`` job); run locally with
``E2E_REUSE_IMAGES=1`` set for fast iteration once the image cache is warm.

GAP FOUND WHILE WRITING THIS E2E, NOW FIXED: ``plan_validation.py``'s stage-1
``_ALLOWED_TOP_LEVEL_MODULES`` originally never added ``typing``/
``__future__``/``logging`` -- the shipped ``plans_core/orm.py``
exemplar this test's positive plan body mirrors uses all three
(`from __future__ import annotations`, `from typing import Any`,
`import logging`), so an author copying that exact, idiomatic house style
verbatim (as the writing-bluesky-plans skill's own format spec shows) would
have had an otherwise entirely benign plan rejected at stage 1 for reasons
unrelated to control-system safety. That allowlist gap has since landed
(task 2.1's `_ALLOWED_TOP_LEVEL_MODULES` now includes all three) --
``_POSITIVE_PLAN_BODY`` below uses the full idiomatic style unmodified.
