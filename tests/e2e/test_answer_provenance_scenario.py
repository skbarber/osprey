"""End-to-end test for the answer-provenance / verify-first scenario.

Exercises the behavioral half of the answer-provenance change: does the agent
*lead with real, tool-sourced data* (naming the source), and — when something
is not tool-backed — flag that plainly and up front, never a confident
pretrained lead and never the "[answer] … I can verify if you want" trailer
that reframes an unverified guess as the answer?

Two neutral operator prompts are run against one deployment (SC6 requires showing
the provenance-summary switch is *conditional*, which a single prompt cannot
demonstrate):

  * a **simple single-value read** — the honest answer is one channel's live
    value; the verify-first behavior should be a terse, sourced one-liner with
    no provenance summary; and
  * a **multi-tool / research** ask — a short investigation across several
    reads; the answer should carry an explicit provenance summary (multiple
    named sources plus a synthesis/confidence note).

Grading is two-layer, matching ``test_corrector_limit_honest_refusal_scenario``:
the LLM judge grades the fuzzy verify-first behavior (SC3/SC4/SC5) on each
answer; a deterministic check grades the provenance-summary discrimination (SC6).

Neither prompt hints at the property under test. Opus tier is pinned (the haiku
default bails on multi-step reasoning and makes the assertion flaky). This test
is **local/advisory**, not a CI merge gate: it is CI-skipped on GitHub Actions
and gated on ``ALS_APG_API_KEY`` (the static render guard
``test_answer_provenance_render`` is the CI-enforceable half).
