"""E2E tests for the ``osprey query`` CLI command.

Exercises the *shipped* command path end-to-end.

Template: ``hello_world`` — the minimal preset with one mock ``controls``
server and an ``example`` channel.  It is self-contained (no ARIEL Postgres,
no real EPICS hardware) and resolves exit 0 in this environment.  The
``control_assistant`` preset was considered but skipped: it declares additional
MCP servers (channel-finder, ARIEL) that require running infrastructure absent
here.

Two tests, two harnesses
------------------------
``test_query_cmd_default_output`` uses ``click.testing.CliRunner`` for the
plain-text code path.  This exercises the Click entry point directly.

``test_query_cmd_json_mcp_connected`` uses ``subprocess.run`` for the
``--json`` path.  Rationale: CliRunner's BytesIO stdout capture and
``sys.exit()`` interact unexpectedly when ``asyncio.run()`` is called inside
the command — the output buffer is empty even though exit_code=0.  The plain
subprocess path (same mechanism ``init_project`` uses) avoids this issue and
is more accurately "end-to-end" for the JSON assertion.

Note on stdout mixing: the SDK logs "Using bundled Claude Code CLI: ..." to
stdout (via Rich) before the JSON payload.  We extract the JSON by finding the
first ``{`` in stdout rather than parsing the full output string.

Mechanism-based verdict
-----------------------
Exit 0 requires ALL declared MCP servers to connect and the agent to finish
without error.  Prompts are operator-style (no inlined channel addresses or
"if any" hedges) — the tests assert mechanism, not specific tool calls.
