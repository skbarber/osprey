"""E2E: a deployment's Python environment is the same on the host and in the image.

The subject on the host side is the RENDER, ``<repo>/build``: the build writes
the project venv and the dependency record (``pyproject.toml``) there. The image
is built from the container context beside it — ``build/.image/<project>``, the
deployment repo the build renders against the ``/app`` path a container sees —
because that is the image ``osprey up`` actually produces.

This is the instrument for the two bugs the honest-execution-config work exists
to fix, and it is deliberately built so that either bug reappearing fails a test
rather than passing quietly.

**Drift.** A profile declares ``environment.python`` pointing at an existing
venv plus one ``environment.packages`` addition. ``uv venv --python
<venv>/bin/python`` does *not* inherit the base venv's packages, so
``freeze_base_environment`` pins them into the project's dependency record
instead. The build therefore has to carry two distinct things into the project —
a package the base venv happened to hold, and a package the profile explicitly
asked for — and both have to survive the trip into the container image. The
reported symptom was a package importable on the host and missing inside a
deployed web-terminal container; :func:`test_container_environment_matches_host`
is that symptom's direct test.

**Execution.** Agent-authored Python ran against a Jupyter kernel gateway OSPREY
never shipped, so ``mcp__python__execute`` failed out of the box.
:func:`test_execute_succeeds_on_host_build` and
:func:`test_execute_succeeds_in_deployed_container` drive the real tool function
— safety checks, adapter, ``ExecutionWrapper`` subprocess, response builder — on
both sides of the host/container boundary and demand a successful run of
``print(2+2)``.

Every assertion here is built to be able to fail:

- ``MARKER_ABSENT`` is a real, installable PyPI distribution that the profile
  never mentions. It must be *un*-importable on both sides, which is what proves
  the probe reports absence rather than always reporting presence — a parity
  test that cannot see a missing package would certify drift instead of
  catching it.
- The host-side assertions run first, so the container comparison can never pass
  by comparing two empty sets.
- The frozen marker's *version* is compared across the boundary, not just its
  name, so a pin that is dropped and re-resolved is still caught.
- Each execution test also runs code that must fail, so "success" cannot be a
  driver that reports success unconditionally.

Requires a container runtime and an editable OSPREY checkout (the image is built
against a wheel staged from this working tree — the same mechanism ``osprey up
--dev`` uses — because an image running the released PyPI build would
measure released code, not this branch). Skips cleanly without either.
