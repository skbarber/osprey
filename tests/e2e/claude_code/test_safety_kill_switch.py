"""E2E safety tests for the writes-disabled kill switch via Claude Code SDK.

Scenarios 9-10: Master kill switch (writes_enabled: false) blocks all writes.

Uses run_sdk_query_with_hooks to exercise the full hook chain. Kill switch
returns "deny" (not "ask"), so hook_events should be EMPTY.

    """Scenario 9: channel_write should be blocked when writes_enabled=false.

    The writes_check hook reads config.yml and denies any channel_write
    or execute(write) when writes_enabled is false.

    Cost budget: $0.50

    Why this test pattern is intentional (NOT a redundant tautology):
        The fixture ``safety_project_writes_off`` simulates the canonical
        production action — an operator flips ``writes_enabled: false`` in
        the render's ``config.yml`` and re-renders the Claude Code
        artifacts. The re-render is load-bearing: it triggers the
        renderer's writes-aware
        ``permissions.deny`` augmentation that moves pure-write tools out
        of ``permissions.ask``. The "fixture creates the condition;
        assertion verifies the kill switch fires" shape mirrors the real
        scenario one-to-one — that's the point, not a flaw. A future
        tautology-heuristic sweep that classified this test as redundant
        would delete a real fail-closed safety gate.

    Why this test pattern is intentional (NOT a redundant tautology):
        Extends Scenario 9's kill-switch coverage to ``execute(write)`` —
        the attack surface where an agent could try to bypass

        is the same canonical operator action (edit the render's

        fixture-creates /
