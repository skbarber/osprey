"""E2E safety tests for read operations via Claude Code SDK.

Scenario 1: Verify that channel_read succeeds for a valid channel.

Uses run_sdk_query_with_hooks to exercise the full hook chain. The
``safety_project`` fixture builds the DEFAULT control_assistant deployment, which
ships ``approval.tools.channel_read: skip``. Under a ``skip`` policy the
approval hook auto-approves the read (no human prompt) by emitting
``permissionDecision: 'allow'``. The safety-relevant invariant is therefore
"every channel_read event is an allow, never a deny/ask" — NOT "no events at
all". See the assertion comment for why an ``allow`` hook decision still
surfaces through can_use_tool while a ``deny`` does not.
