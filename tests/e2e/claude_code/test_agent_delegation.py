"""E2E tests for agent delegation to specialist sub-agents.

Tests the full pipeline: user prompt → main agent → sub-agent delegation →
MCP tool calls → (optionally) submit_response.

Covers the in-core sub-agents shipped by the ``control_assistant`` preset:

- logbook-search (ARIEL/PostgreSQL)
- logbook-deep-research (ARIEL/PostgreSQL, opus model)
- data-visualizer (workspace plotting/LaTeX tools, no facility backend)

Facility-specific sub-agents (literature/wiki/matlab/graph) are not
covered here — a facility ships them in its own build profile, and coverage
for them belongs alongside that profile.

These tests use real API calls via the Claude Agent SDK — zero mocking.

**LOCAL-ONLY E2E.** Skipped in CI; the per-agent backends are not
provisioned on GitHub Actions runners. To run locally you need:

- Claude Code CLI installed (`brew install claude`)
- `claude_agent_sdk` Python package installed
- `ALS_APG_API_KEY` (see `tests/e2e/sdk_helpers.init_project` for why
  als-apg is the CI-default; locally cborg/anthropic also work if their
  keys are set)
- ARIEL Postgres reachable at ``localhost:5432`` with the ``ariel`` DB
  populated (used by logbook-search, logbook-deep-research)

The data-visualizer test needs no facility backend — only an
Anthropic-compatible provider — so it runs whenever the test file is
collected.
