"""SDK-based E2E tests for Claude Code + OSPREY MCP integration.

These tests use the Claude Agent SDK (claude_agent_sdk) to spawn Claude Code
as a subprocess and stream typed Python objects for every step, enabling
assertions on individual tool calls, their inputs, outputs, ordering, and cost.

Requires:
- Claude Code CLI installed
- claude_agent_sdk Python package installed
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable set

Safety Note - Permission Bypass:
Tests use permission_mode="bypassPermissions" because:
1. Tests run in isolated tmp_path directories with no real codebase
2. Prompts are controlled and only request data retrieval + plotting
3. The project uses mock connectors (no real EPICS hardware)
4. max_budget_usd caps API spend
