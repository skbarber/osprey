"""E2E approval flow tests via Claude Code SDK with hooks enabled.

Tests that the approval hook correctly fires (or doesn't fire) based on
approval mode, and that approval/denial decisions propagate to Claude.

4 scenarios:
  2a: channel_write triggers approval callback (selective + auto-approve)
  2c: Approval denial propagates to Claude
  2d: `default_policy: always` asks for everything (including reads)
  2e: Limits deny blocks before approval callback fires

    Why this test pattern is intentional (NOT a redundant tautology):
        This test guards a fail-closed backstop. Production scenario: an
        operator misconfigures ``approval.tools`` (omits an entry) or a
        new tool ships before its ``approval.tools`` entry is added. In
        both cases, ``default_policy: always`` is what catches the
        unknown tool and routes it through approval rather than letting
        it pass silently. The fixture ``safety_project_default_policy_always``
        removes ``approval.tools`` entirely to force every tool — including
        the otherwise-permissive ``channel_read`` — down the default-policy
        path. The fixture-creates / assertion-verifies shape mirrors the
        real fail-closed invariant; without this test, a regression that
        broke the default path could land silently.
