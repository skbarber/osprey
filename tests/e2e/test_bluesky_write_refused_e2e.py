"""E2E safety test: ``osprey query``'s toolset excludes the plan queue's
arming tools AND the emergency halt.

Proves the read-only guarantee at the SDK layer for the plan surface:
``mcp__bluesky__queue_add``, ``mcp__bluesky__queue_start`` and
``mcp__bluesky__stop_run`` never appear in a query run's tool trace, while the
read/allow-listed plan tools (``get_run``, ``get_run_data``) remain
structurally available. Direct analog of
``tests/e2e/test_query_write_refused_e2e.py`` for ``channel_write``.

The load-bearing mechanism is identical to that precedent: the SDK-level
``disallowed_tools`` list (sourced from the framework registry via
``read_only_disallowed_tools`` -> ``_registry_side_effect_tools``, which walks
every ``permissions_ask`` tool including the bluesky server's) strips those tools
from the model's toolset entirely, so they can never execute in a headless
read-only run — independent of whether a live Bluesky bridge is even
reachable, and independent of ``control_system.writes_enabled`` (the in-tool
re-read is a second, unit-tested guard; see
``tests/mcp_server/bluesky/test_queue_tools.py``).

TWO DIFFERENT REASONS, and the distinction matters — read before "fixing" the
``stop_run`` case:

* ``queue_add``/``queue_start`` are WRITES. They arm hardware motion, so
  keeping them out of a one-shot read-only surface is the ordinary read-only
  guarantee.
* ``stop_run`` is the EMERGENCY HALT — ``POST /queue/abort``, the one surface
  that stops a plan already moving hardware. It is deliberately UNGATED
  everywhere it is offered (no launch token, no writes gate) precisely because
  a halt must never have a policy failure mode. It is absent here not because
  it leaked out of a write gate, but because ``osprey query`` is a one-shot,
  non-interactive question-answering surface, not an operations console: a
  halt belongs where a human is present to see what happened and follow up.
  The interactive surfaces own it — the operator chat, the BLUESKY panel's
  Abort control, and the bridge API itself.

So the assertion below is a scope decision, not a leak guard, and it must stay:
weakening it would put an emergency control on a surface with nobody watching.
If ``osprey query`` ever grows an interactive mode, that is the moment to
revisit — not by relaxing this test, but by deciding deliberately.

Do NOT mark this test flaky. Safety contracts must stay strict.
