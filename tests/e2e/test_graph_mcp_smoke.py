"""Agentic e2e acceptance gate for the graph MCP server.

This is the feature's acceptance test: a deployment built from the
``control_assistant`` preset, pointed at a *real* Neo4j 5.26 + neosemantics
store seeded with the shipped demo-machine corpus, driven by a real agent
session with an operator-style question about the machine's structure. The
claim under test is the whole chain at once — the preset renders ``graph`` into
``.mcp.json`` and the ``facility-knowledge-graph`` subagent beside it, the
server comes up, the main agent delegates to the subagent *on its own*, the
read-only Cypher path answers, and the answer is right about the corpus.

What the fixture stands up, and why each piece is shaped the way it is:

* **A store of its own.** ``neo4j:5.26-community`` with the pinned neosemantics
  5.26.0 jar bind-mounted at ``/plugins`` and APOC copied out of the image —
  the recipe ``tests/integration/test_graphdb_store.py`` established; see that
  module's docstring for why ``NEO4J_PLUGINS`` is deliberately unset. The
  container takes a **random published port and testcontainers' own generated
  name**, so it can never collide with a ``graphdb`` service a developer has
  deployed on the same host, and two of these can run side by side.
* **A project patched onto that port.** ``services.graphdb.port_host`` in the
  render's ``config.yml`` and ``GRAPHDB_PASSWORD`` in the repo's ``.env`` are
  the two values that decide *which* store the MCP server dials and with what
  credential. Both are read at server **runtime** (the connection is resolved
  on first use from ``CONFIG_FILE``; the ``.env`` chain is loaded by
  ``run_mcp_server`` at launch), neither participates in rendering — which is
  why they are patched onto the finished build rather than through a profile
  override, exactly as ``tests/e2e/claude_code/conftest.py`` repoints the
  limits database. That the render carries ``graph`` at all is not assumed:
  :func:`_assert_graph_is_rendered` pins it before anything is patched.
* **The corpus, seeded through the shipped verb.** ``osprey knowledge
  seed-graph`` against the rendered project, so the graph the agent queries got
  there by the same path an operator's would — including the ``_OspreySeed``
  marker.

Grading is the two layers ``tests/e2e/README.md`` asks for:

* a **deterministic floor** over the tool trace — a ``mcp__graph__*`` tool was
  reached, through the subagent and never by the main agent directly, that
  call succeeded, and the prose (all of it, not just the closing message)
  invents no channel address that is not in the corpus; and
* an **LLM judge** over the prose, against a rubric written from facts read
  back out of this very corpus (see :data:`_VERIFIED` — every number in the
  rubric was queried from the seeded store, not assumed from the generator).

The prompt is operator-style and names **no** tool, server, MCP prefix, Cypher
keyword or JSON key. It names one PV, because that is the operator's own
handle on the problem, and asks three things a flat channel list cannot answer
on its own: which *device* that address belongs to, what else that device
exposes, and where it sits along the ring. If a natural question like that
fails to reach the graph, that is a wiring or tool-description finding to fix
in the framework — never by steering the prompt toward the tool.

Budget: ``max_turns=14``, ``max_budget_usd=1.5`` — larger than the
single-tool health smoke because this is a multi-hop question the agent may
approach through ``example_queries``/``get_schema`` before writing Cypher.

The floor half is dry-verifiable offline, the way
``test_plan_stack_agentic.py`` makes its own floor dry-verifiable — no Docker,
no API key, no agent session, no container::

    uv run pytest tests/e2e/test_graph_mcp_smoke.py -k floor

Those tests grade :func:`fabricated_addresses`, the same helper the live test
calls, against hand-written strings. That is why this module carries **no**
module-level ``pytestmark``: a blanket ``requires_als_apg`` plus the SDK and
CLI skips would skip the offline half too, and a floor nobody can run cheaply
is a floor nobody re-runs when they change the regex. The live test carries
its own gating decorators instead.

# this file have different prerequisites and therefore different markers:
#
#   * the live acceptance test carries ``e2e``/``slow``/``agentic_benchmark``
#     (the lane: the agent must choose and sequence tools and reason about what
#     came back, and a weak model plausibly fails it), ``requires_als_apg``, and
#     the SDK/CLI skips, and
#   * the offline floor tests carry ``harness_benchmark`` (an assertion about
#     OSPREY's own grading logic, model-independent by construction) and nothing
#     else, so they run on any host.
#
# ALS_APG_API_KEY is enforced via ``requires_als_apg`` — the root
# ``tests/conftest.py`` hook auto-skips when the key is missing, and the CI lane
# fails outright if the secret is unset, so a missing credential is never a
# silent pass. Both halves are collected by the shared ``e2e-tests`` job
# (``pytest tests/e2e/``) — no dedicated lane and no ``--ignore`` entry: the
# container takes a random port and a generated name, so it leaves no
# host-global residue.

#: device's channel.
#:
#: The **whole** six-token grammar is required — ``RING:SYSTEM:FAMILY:DEVICE``
#: plus ``FIELD:SUBFIELD`` — rather than "the prefix and one or more segments".
#: A greedy prefix match reads a *truncated* mention as an address in its own
#: right, and then reports it as fabricated because the corpus holds no such
#: channel. That is not hypothetical: an otherwise perfect answer that rendered
#: the flagged channel as ``SR:MAG:DIPOLE:01:CURRENT:**SP**`` (markdown emphasis
#: on the last token) failed this floor on ``SR:MAG:DIPOLE:01:CURRENT``. Hence
#: also :data:`_MARKDOWN_EMPHASIS`: agents format addresses, and a fabrication
#: detector that trips on bold text detects formatting, not fabrication.
#:
#: The trailing negative lookahead is the other half of that rule, in the other
#: direction: without it a *longer* invention such as
#: ``SR:MAG:DIPOLE:01:CURRENT:SP:LIMIT`` matches on its first six tokens, which
#: ARE a real address, and the floor reports the whole thing as legitimate. With
#: it, that string matches nothing at all — so this floor never launders a
#: deeper-token invention as real, and the seven-token case is left to the judge
#: (criterion 4), which reads the answer rather than a prefix of it. Both edges

#: Operator-style, and deliberately naming nothing the agent could pattern-match
#: onto a tool: no server, no ``mcp__`` prefix, no Cypher keyword, no JSON key,
#: no mention of a graph. The one identifier it carries is a PV, because that is
#: what an operator would have in front of them. The three asks are structural —
#: which *device* owns an address, what else that device exposes, and where it
#: sits along the ring — and the last of those is not in any channel list.
OPERATOR_PROMPT = (
    "A handover note flags SR:MAG:DIPOLE:01:CURRENT:SP for follow-up, but it "
    "doesn't say why. Before I chase it: which piece of hardware does that "
    "address actually belong to, what else can I read or set on that same piece "
    "of hardware, and whereabouts does it sit in the storage ring relative to "
    "the other dipoles?"
)

_RUBRIC = f"""\
Evaluation of an accelerator operator's question about one device in the
facility. The agent had read-only access to a knowledge graph describing the
machine, and the deterministic half of this test has ALREADY verified, from the
tool trace, that the agent queried that graph successfully and that it invented
no channel addresses. Do NOT re-grade either of those; grade only the answer's
substance against the ground truth below.

GROUND TRUTH (read directly out of the corpus the agent was querying):
  * The address {PROBE_PV} belongs to a single device, a storage-ring dipole
    magnet named {_VERIFIED["device_name"]} (URI {_VERIFIED["device_uri"]}).
    Equivalent renderings of that identity — "DIPOLE 01", "dipole 1", "the
    first storage-ring dipole", the bare URI — are all correct.
  * That device carries exactly six channel bindings:
    {", ".join(PROBE_DEVICE_BINDINGS)}.
    Only {PROBE_PV} is writable; the other five are read-only.
  * The device sits in section {_VERIFIED["section"]} at longitudinal position
    s = {_VERIFIED["s_position_m"]} m, ordinal {_VERIFIED["ordinal_in_section"]}
    within its section. It is the FIRST dipole along the storage ring. The
    device immediately downstream is {_VERIFIED["next_device"][0]} at
    s = {_VERIFIED["next_device"][1]} m; the one immediately upstream is
    {_VERIFIED["previous_device"][0]} (a beam-loss monitor) at
    s = {_VERIFIED["previous_device"][1]} m.
  * Dipole census, and BOTH figures are correct depending on what is being
    counted: the storage ring holds {_VERIFIED["dipole_count_sr"]} dipoles
    (DIPOLE01-DIPOLE{_VERIFIED["dipole_count_sr"]}), evenly spaced
    {_VERIFIED["sr_dipole_spacing_m"]} m apart from
    s = {_VERIFIED["sr_dipole_span_m"][0]} m to
    s = {_VERIFIED["sr_dipole_span_m"][1]} m, while the machine as a whole holds
    {_VERIFIED["dipole_count_machine"]} — the other
    {_VERIFIED["dipole_count_machine"] - _VERIFIED["dipole_count_sr"]} are the
    booster's. An answer that attributes the machine-wide figure
    ({_VERIFIED["dipole_count_machine"]}) to the storage ring, or the ring
    figure ({_VERIFIED["dipole_count_sr"]}) to the machine as a whole, IS wrong
    under (4). Do not penalise an answer merely for choosing the scope the
    operator did not ask about, as long as it names that scope.

PASS only if ALL of the following hold:

  (1) The answer identifies the owning device correctly — a storage-ring
      dipole, the first one / number 01. Naming it by any of the equivalent
      renderings above is fine. Getting the device wrong (a different dipole, a
      quadrupole, "a magnet power supply" with no device identity) is a FAIL.

  (2) The answer says what else that device exposes, and what it says is
      consistent with the six bindings above. It need NOT list all six, and it
      may describe them in words ("a current setpoint, a readback, a golden
      reference and three status flags") rather than as literal addresses.
      Naming channels that are not among the six, or claiming the device
      exposes something the corpus does not carry, is a FAIL.

  (3) The answer places the device along the ring in a way consistent with the
      ground truth — its s-position, its ordinal, or its being the first dipole
      with the others following. A vague "it's in the storage ring" with no
      ordering or position at all does NOT satisfy this; an explicit,
      well-grounded statement that the position information could not be
      retrieved is also a FAIL, because it IS in the corpus the agent queried.

  (4) The answer does not fabricate. Every concrete claim it makes about THIS
      device, the storage-ring dipole line, or this device's immediate
      neighbours must be consistent with the ground truth above. Hedged or
      partial answers are acceptable; confidently wrong ones are not.

Scope limits on (4), so it grades fabrication rather than incompleteness:

  * The ground truth above is the ONLY answer key. It describes DIPOLE01, its
    bindings, its neighbours and the dipole census. The corpus also holds ~512
    devices this rubric says nothing about (correctors, quadrupoles,
    sextupoles, BPMs, vacuum and RF equipment). A claim about one of those is
    NOT a fabrication merely because this rubric does not list it — mark it
    wrong only if it contradicts something stated above.
  * Omitting anything the operator did not ask for is not a failure.

Do NOT grade formatting, verbosity, tone, or whether the agent went on to read
live values. Numerical position may be rounded or given in different units as
long as the ordering claim is right. FAIL if any of (1)-(4) is violated."""
