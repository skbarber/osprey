"""Full-stack Docker e2e for event dispatch (L2) — highest fidelity.

Unlike the subprocess sweep (``test_dispatch_tutorial.py``), this exercises the
REAL shipped artifacts: the compose templates, the bundled Dockerfile (which
installs Node + the Claude Code CLI the worker needs), the worker ``env_file``
wiring that carries provider auth, and the in-network ``dispatch-worker-1``
routing baked into the shipped ``tutorial_triggers.yml`` — none of which the
subprocess path touches.

It inits + builds a control-assistant deployment repo, deploys the stack with
``osprey up -d --dev``, fires all four tutorial webhooks at the dispatcher
(host-published on this deployment's dispatcher slot), and asserts:

  * hello-dispatch / triage-event / save-report -> a run completes
  * denied-tool-demo -> rejected by the worker denylist (no completed run)

The same deploy also stands up the preset's multi-user web tier (local image
mode): the build renders one persona project per ``personas/`` delta into
``build/<repo>-<persona>/``, ``up`` builds one ``:local`` image per persona and
brings up nginx + one web-terminal container per roster user. Four more things
are asserted on top:

  T1 topology:      nginx + both per-user containers come up healthy and the
                    landing page lists both roster users.
  T2 readonly tier:  the rendered READ-ONLY persona project pins
                     ``control_system.writes_enabled: false`` and its rendered
                     ``settings.json`` denies the channel-write tool.
  T3 readwrite tier: the rendered READ-WRITE persona project arms writes and
                     keeps the tool on the ask (human-approval) path — the
                     positive control that T2 is a real posture difference.
  T4 same surface:   both persona projects declare the IDENTICAL ``.mcp.json``
                     server set — the tier boundary is enforcement, never a
                     quietly different tool surface.

COEXISTENCE: every host-published web port and the web-container name prefix
(``facility.prefix``) are remapped to e2e-unique values in the build override,
so this deploy can run beside a real control-assistant stack on the same host
without colliding on ports or container names. The persona ``:local`` image
tags are namespaced by the repo's own name (``osprey init`` writes each catalog
entry's ``project`` as ``<repo>-<persona>``), which keeps them off a real
deployment's tags for free. Teardown names exact resources only — never a
prune or wildcard.

The worker receives its provider key via ``env_file: ./.env`` (see the
dispatch_worker compose template) — the compose CLI reads the repo's ``.env``
on the HOST (as its owner, even when it's 0600) and injects the vars directly
into the container environment, so the non-root worker never has to open the
file itself. Without that wiring the agent run cannot authenticate, so this
test also guards it.

Gating: needs Docker and ``ALS_APG_API_KEY``. We do NOT gate on a host
``claude`` binary — the CLI lives inside the built image, not on the runner.
