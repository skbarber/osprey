"""End-to-end test for the RF-cavity CAVITY01 thermal-excursion scenario.

Operator-style prompt — one diagnostic imperative, one deliverable, no
subsystem hints:

    "The beam dumped this morning. Figure out what happened and plot the data."

This is the cross-paradigm benchmark's RF scenario. It tests whether the
agent can, from a bare beam-dump report, (a) enumerate the canonical
suspects for unplanned beam loss (RF trip / vacuum event / magnet fault /
etc.) without being told, (b) discover and retrieve the relevant telemetry
for each suspect, (c) commit to a single cavity (CAVITY01, device 01) as the
fault source based on the telemetry signature, and (d) name the mechanism
(thermal detuning → reflected-power spike → forward-power trip).

A multi-day logbook arc rides in the ``rf-thermal`` scenario bundle for
cross-source enrichment: DEMO-026 (trip) → DEMO-027 (investigation identifying
cooling-manifold blockage) → DEMO-028 (manifold flush repair). The bundle
carries these as *relative* timestamps (``when: {days_ago, time}``); applying
the scenario resolves them against one apply-time anchor (newest entry lands
two days before today) and seeds them into ARIEL. The telemetry ground truth
lives in the same bundle (``data/simulation/scenarios/rf-thermal/``): the three
CAVITY01 thermal excursions are anchored to that same apply-time T0 via
``at_offset`` — T0-38h, T0-21h and T0-7h, each a 2h-sigma spike. They therefore
sit at fixed wall-clock times rather than at a fixed proportion of whatever
window the agent asks for, which is what makes them storable in a real archiver;
because the anchor is set when the scenario is applied, the test stays
date-agnostic all the same. Two consequences for the agent's search: the most
recent excursion falls a few hours back, so the prompt's "this morning" points
at real data, and a lookback shorter than about two days will not show all three
excursions. The test activates the scenario after
building the deployment via ``activate_scenarios(repo, "rf-thermal")``, which
also purges + reseeds the logbook so narrative and telemetry share one clock;
the mock connectors then route RF cavity / klystron / DCCT reads through the
engine instead of the flat ``nominal`` default.

The agent must:

1. Decompose "beam dumped" into the canonical subsystem suspects and
   dispatch parallel investigations (the CLAUDE.md template guides this).
2. Discover RF cavity + DCCT + vacuum-gauge channel addresses via
   channel-finder.
3. Pull a sensible time window via ``mcp__controls__archiver_read`` for
   both cavities (so it can contrast CAVITY01 against CAVITY02) and at least DCCT.
4. Produce a plot via the data-visualizer subagent showing the correlated
   excursions on CAVITY01 with CAVITY02 stable for reference.
5. Identify CAVITY01 (not CAVITY02) as the source and name the thermal-detuning
   mechanism.
