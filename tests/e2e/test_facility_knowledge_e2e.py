"""Agent e2e: facility knowledge MCP server in the control-assistant preset.

The test builds a control-assistant deployment (whose example OKF bundle is
rendered to ``build/data/facility_knowledge/``), runs an operator-style query that requires the
agent to consult the facility_knowledge MCP server, and asserts:

- At least one ``mcp__osprey_facility_knowledge__*`` tool was called.
- The LLM judge rates the answer as passing (correct, relevant, no unhandled
  errors).

In addition to the two direct-retrieval tests, a delegation test asserts:

- The main orchestrator delegates to the ``facility-knowledge`` subagent
  (subagent tool calls observed with a non-None ``parent_tool_use_id``).
- FK tools are called from within the subagent context — not directly by
  the orchestrator.

Architectural forcing: ``disallowed_tools`` blocks the orchestrator from
calling FK tools directly, so it must hand off to the subagent.  This is
the same mechanism used for channel-finder delegation (a settings constraint,
not a prompt hint).

Prompt design: operator-style questions only — no concept IDs, PV patterns,
or "if any" hedges are inlined.  The agent must discover what the bundle
contains and navigate to the answer on its own.

Budget: max_turns=6 (direct tests) / max_turns=20 (delegation test),
max_budget_usd=0.25 / 1.0.
Marked ``@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=2)`` per the agentic-e2e convention for
rare LLM stochastic misses.
