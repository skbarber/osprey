"""Phase 1 acceptance proof: the Virtual Accelerator + Bluesky bridge substrate,
co-deployed as real containers, is equivalent to (and honest about divergence
from) a real EPICS beamline (PROPOSAL.md's Risk-1/Station-2 gate).

One module-scoped init + build + ``osprey up -d --dev`` co-deploys the
Virtual Accelerator (task 4.1) and the Bluesky bridge (task 2.9) wired to the
EPICS substrate scanner (task 2.3), with one sp-echo ``:SP`` pre-faulted
(task 3.1's ``VA_STUCK_SETPOINTS``) via task 4.2's env passthrough. Five
proofs then exercise the whole stack end to end:

  P1 co-deploy:     containers up, healthy, loopback-only, depends_on ordering held.
  P2 liveness:      the full manifest namespace is reachable over CA.
  P3 read-equiv:    a pyepics (host) read and an ophyd-async (bridge) read of
                     the same PV agree.
  P4 concurrent:    an EPICS-substrate ``grid_scan`` plan runs to completion
                     while a concurrent host read observes the same PV
                     consistently — the loop-affinity falsifier.
  P5 honest divergence: a write to a pre-faulted ``:SP`` verifies (the SP
                     always latches its own readback), but an independent read
                     of the sibling ``:RB`` proves it never moved — and both
                     CA clients (host + bridge) agree on that frozen value.

Plans reach the hardware through the bridge's QUEUE, not a direct-execute
route: P3/P4 stage the plan in the shared draft, enqueue that exact revision,
and arm ``POST /queue/start`` with the launch token (``PATCH /draft`` ->
``POST /queue/items`` -> ``POST /queue/start`` -> poll ``GET /runs/{id}``,
spelled once in ``tests/e2e/_queue_drive.py``). That is transport only — what
these proofs assert about the substrate is unchanged.

No preset channel names are hardcoded: every address used below is derived
from the DEPLOYED render's own ``build/data/channel_limits.json`` (writable ⟺ a
``:SP`` address) restricted to sp-echo pairs (``classify_partition`` — a
write to a pyat-coupled ``:SP`` has ring-wide physics side effects, wrong for
an isolated fault/equivalence probe; sp-echo is a pure software echo, exactly
what P3-P5 need).

Container safety: every docker invocation below names an exact container/image
— never a wildcard, never ``system prune``/``--volumes``. The one forced
``docker rmi -f <image>`` (below) names an exact image, matching
``test_bluesky_deploy.py``'s precedent for forcing a fresh ``--dev`` build.
Teardown goes through ``osprey down``, never a raw ``docker rm`` sweep,
followed by exact-named removal of this project's own volumes
(``tests/e2e/_volumes.py``): ``down`` keeps them by design, and a rerun must
not inherit their state.

Gating: needs Docker; the VA image builds natively for the host arch, so on
Apple Silicon PyAT/softioc compile from source (no prebuilt aarch64 wheels) —
slow (minutes) on a cold image cache. Lives in ``tests/e2e/`` (never
collected by the fast lane, see ``ci_check.sh``/ci.yml).

Markers: ``pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=1, only_rerun=[AssertionError])`` is
applied PER-FUNCTION to P1-P4 only, never at module level — P5 is the safety
proof and must stay strict (mirrors ``test_bluesky_write_refused_e2e``'s
strictness). A module-level ``flaky`` would silently sweep P5 into lenient
reruns, which is exactly the bug this convention exists to prevent.
