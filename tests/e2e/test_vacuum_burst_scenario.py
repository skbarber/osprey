"""End-to-end test for the Sector-7 vacuum-burst + beam-loss scenario.

This is the talk-demo scenario, set up as the seed for the OSPREY benchmark
suite. The operator prompt is intentionally bare:

    "We lost about 5 mA of beam yesterday around 14:32. Did the vacuum
    do anything weird around then?"

That is the full prompt. No channel names, no PV patterns, no time-window
shape, no "if any" hedging. The agent must do the discovery work:

  1. Translate "vacuum" → pressure gauges and use the channel-finder
     pipeline to resolve actual addresses (``SR:VAC:GAUGE:SR{01..12}:...``).
     Refetching DCCT is welcome but not required: the operator already
     announced the beam-loss event with a timestamp.
  2. Resolve "yesterday around 14:32" to a concrete past timestamp and
     choose a sensible time window straddling 14:32:08, then call
     ``mcp__controls__archiver_read`` to fetch the vacuum time series.
  3. Inspect across sectors and finger Sector 7 (SR07) — the only
     sector whose pressure spike aligns with the beam-loss event
     (ground truth: Pearson r ≈ -0.88 against DCCT; max|r| for the
     other 11 sectors ≤ 0.077).

The ground truth lives in the preset's simulation overlay,
``data/simulation/machine.json`` (the ``vacuum-burst`` scenario): the SR07
pressure spike + coincident DCCT dip are declared as an ``at_time`` event
anchored daily at 14:32:08. The test activates that scenario after building
the deployment via ``activate_scenarios(repo, "vacuum-burst")``; the mock
connectors then route gauge/DCCT reads through the engine instead of the
flat ``nominal`` default.

If the agent can't do this, the failure is in the OSPREY preset config
(channel-finder agent context, archiver tool description, planner prompt) —
fix the config, don't weaken the prompt. This test is the contract.

The afternoon anchor (14:32) is deliberate: it temporally separates this
telemetry-only scenario from the RF-cavity scenario's morning logbook arc
(DEMO-026/027/028, ~2-3 days back), so logbook search cannot contaminate
the vacuum investigation. "Yesterday" rather than "today" keeps the
timestamp unambiguously in the past regardless of when the test runs.

The ``at_time`` event fires for every calendar date whose 14:32:08 falls
inside the requested window, so the test is date-agnostic.
