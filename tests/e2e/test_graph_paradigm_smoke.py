"""Agentic e2e acceptance gate for the **graph channel-finder paradigm**.

Sibling to :mod:`tests.e2e.test_graph_mcp_smoke`, and deliberately the other
half of the same story. That module proves the ``graph`` server — reached
through the **facility-knowledge-graph subagent** — answers a structural
question about the machine. This one proves the **fourth
channel-finder paradigm**: a deployment built with
``channel_finder_mode: graph`` answers an ordinary "which channel do I write
to?" question through the **channel-finder subagent**, whose four tools are the
read-only Cypher vocabulary shipped under the ``channel-finder`` server name.

Three claims, in the order the chain makes them:

1. **The render selects the paradigm's server.** ``osprey init --set
   channel_finder_mode=graph`` followed by ``osprey build`` puts
   ``-m osprey.mcp_server.channel_finder_graph`` in the render's ``.mcp.json``
   under the ``channel-finder`` key, and arms the rendered subagent with
   exactly ``capabilities``, ``example_queries``, ``get_schema`` and
   ``read_cypher`` (plus ``submit_response``) — and with no ``mcp__graph__``
   entry, because the subagent reaches the store through its own server name.
   ``tests/cli/test_channel_finder_graph_tools.py`` pins the same shape off
   ``create_project``; this module pins it off the render ``osprey build``
   actually produces, which is a second code path (``regenerate_claude_code``).
2. **That server talks to a real store.** A throwaway Neo4j 5.26 +
   neosemantics container, seeded with the shipped demo-machine corpus through
   ``osprey knowledge seed-graph`` — the container, plugin and seeding recipe
   are imported wholesale from the sibling module rather than restated, so the
   two lanes cannot drift on how a graph store is stood up.
3. **The agent uses it, unprompted, through the subagent.** One operator-style
   question naming no tool, no server and no query language. The floor is
   deterministic: a ``mcp__channel-finder__read_cypher`` call that originated
   in a sub-agent context, at least one real ``fullPv`` from the corpus in what
   that call returned *and* in the agent's prose, and no fabricated address —
   graded by :func:`tests.e2e.test_graph_mcp_smoke.fabricated_addresses`, the
   same helper, so the two lanes share one definition of "invented".

There is no LLM judge here. The sibling needs one because "where does this sit
along the ring" is prose that only a reader can grade; a channel-address answer
is checkable against the corpus by string equality, and a cheaper gate that
proves the same thing is the better gate.

**Why the standalone graph server is switched off.** ``control_assistant``
declares ``services.graphdb``, so a graph-paradigm render carries *both* the
standalone ``graph`` server (the facility-knowledge-graph subagent's) and the
``channel-finder`` one — two doors onto the same store. Left open, which door
the model picks is a coin flip, and a run that answered perfectly through
``mcp__graph__read_cypher`` would prove nothing about the paradigm. So the run
passes ``disallowed_tools=["mcp__graph"]``, the CLI's server-level deny form:
no agent in the session can see that server at all — the deny reaches the
facility-knowledge-graph subagent too — and the only remaining route to the
store is the one under test. The channel-finder subagent is unaffected, since
``mcp__graph__*`` is not in its vocabulary to begin with.

Budget: ``max_turns=14``, ``max_budget_usd=1.5`` — the same envelope as the
sibling, because it is the same shape of work: the subagent will usually read
``example_queries`` or ``get_schema`` before it writes Cypher.

The render half needs neither Docker nor a credential and is the task's
validation gate::

    pytest tests/e2e/test_graph_paradigm_smoke.py -k render

which is why this module, like its sibling, carries **no** module-level
``pytestmark``: a blanket ``requires_als_apg`` would skip a half that has
nothing to do with a model. The live test carries its own gating decorators.

One trap worth naming for anyone running this outside an installed checkout:
``osprey knowledge seed-graph`` is spawned as a subprocess **with its cwd at
the render**, so a relative ``PYTHONPATH=src`` does not resolve there and the
subprocess silently falls back to whatever ``osprey`` the interpreter has
installed. Point ``PYTHONPATH`` at an absolute ``src`` and the seeding step
runs the code under test rather than another checkout's.
