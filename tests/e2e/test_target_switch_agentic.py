"""An agent, two machines, and the approval prompt that tells them apart.

Every other suite in this repo proves the target switch from the inside: a
manager is constructed, a switch is awaited, a connector is asked what it sees.
This one proves it from where an operator stands. A real Claude Code session
runs against a real render, reaches for the real MCP tools, and the approval
prompts it raises are read back as strings — because the prompt is the only
thing standing between "the agent asked to write" and "the agent moved the
machine", and a prompt that names the wrong machine is worse than no prompt.

That demands two Channel Access servers answering the SAME channel names with
DIFFERENT values, so a claim about which one a session is pointed at can be
settled on the wire rather than taken on trust:

* the **virtual accelerator** (``osprey-va-full``) is the deployment baseline,
  the target the preset ships pointing at;
* the **bench IOC** (``bench-ioc``, :mod:`tests.fixtures.bench_ioc`) plays the
  live machine — a stock ``softIoc`` serving seeded constants, deliberately not
  a second simulation, so nothing about it can be mistaken for the first.

The fixture below builds that world once per module and the tests spend it.
What it is NOT is an ``osprey up`` deployment: no bluesky bridge, no tiled, no
mongo, no web terminals, no persona renders. Those are trimmed in the overlay
rather than merely left unused, because a registered-but-unreachable backend
turns a curious agent's exploration into a connection failure that reads, in a
transcript, exactly like a bug in the thing under test.

The FR-7 smoke sits above the four scenarios and is written first on purpose:
every scenario asserts on approval-prompt wording, so if the hook's reason text
does not survive the trip from the rendered hook back into the test, every
scenario assertion built on it is vacuous. Prove the channel carries text before
writing anything that reads it. That gate has already earned its place — the
first run of it found that the obvious channel does NOT carry the text on the
installed CLI; see :func:`approval_prompts` for which one does and why.

The four scenarios then spend the fixture, one operator situation each, and each
one is graded in three tiers that never overlap: **wire truth** (what the two
Channel Access servers actually hold, read back out of process), a
**deterministic floor** over the tool trace, the hook events and the session's
own target-state file, and exactly one **LLM-judge** criterion covering only what
a trace cannot see — whether the agent's prose was honest about which machine it
was on. Nothing a floor can settle is ever left to the judge.

Three notes for whoever extends this:

* The bench IOC is booted FIRST, before ``osprey init`` runs. Its port is not
  guessed and cannot be: it goes into the overlay as
  ``target_switch.live_gateway_acknowledged``, and an overlay written against a
  port some later boot might not get is an overlay that renders a deployment
  pointed at nothing. Booting the bench through its own shared context manager
  (rather than pre-allocating a port and re-deriving its boot here) is what
  keeps this module's bench on the same readiness contract as every other
  consumer's.
* Every Channel Access read runs out of process, through
  :func:`tests.fixtures.bench_ioc.ca_op`. The client library latches its
  environment at first use, so an in-process reader would pin this pytest
  process to whichever of the two ports it happened to touch first — fatal in a
  module whose whole subject is two servers on two ports.
* Approval-prompt text is read from the session transcript, not from
  ``HookEvent.decision_reason``. Reach for :func:`approval_prompts` /
  :func:`hook_reason_for` rather than the field; the docstring on the first
  says what is wrong with the field and when to go back to it.

def _overlay_text(*, bench_port: int, va_port: int) -> str:
    """The single ``-O`` layer that turns the stock preset into this world.

    Written with **literal dotted keys** under ``config:``, which is not a style
    choice: ``osprey build`` refuses a profile that spells one subtree both ways,
    and ``--set config.control_system.*`` would merge a competing nested mapping
    alongside the preset's dotted keys and be hard-refused. A ``-O`` file is
    exempt from that collision rule and replaces keys in the spelling the
    profile already uses.

    What each group is for, since none of it is decoration:

    ``connector.*``
        One real Channel Access endpoint per target. ``use_name_server: true``
        on every gateway is mandatory here — without it the connector takes the
        process-global ``EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST`` branch, which is a genuine hazard
        with two targets on two ephemeral ports. Both gateway roles name the
        same endpoint per target: there is one server behind each.
    ``probe_channel``
        Mandatory in BOTH directions (a switch probes its destination), and
        shipped commented out in the template, so it must be set here or every
        switch fails at the probe.
    ``control_system.type: virtual_accelerator``
        The deployment baseline. The preset baselines on its live stand-in,
        and with that stand-in nulled below the build refuses a baseline
        naming a machine nothing serves — so the baseline is set back to the
        simulator here, explicitly. It has to be the simulator: a switch
        toward the bench is then a move AWAY from the baseline, and the
        acknowledgment gate is genuinely exercised rather than sidestepped.
    ``target_switch.live_gateway_acknowledged``
        The operator acknowledgment naming this run's bench endpoint.
    ``limits_checking.allow_unlisted_channels``
        The only DEPLOYMENT-WIDE limits key this overlay sets. The preset
        already ships it ``false``, and the render keeps its own 2908-channel
        ``data/channel_limits.json`` as ``database_path``; the line is restated
        here so the lane pins the posture it needs rather than silently
        inheriting whatever the preset's posture later becomes. The
        strict-limits gate requires it falsy — true or absent leaves the live
        target blocked on a limits-posture reason and no switch is ever
        reachable. The overlay writes no per-type
        ``connector.<type>.limits_checking`` block of its own: the preset's
        permissive ``virtual_accelerator`` block rides along and answers for the
        simulator, while ``live`` — an ``epics`` target with no block of its own
        — is answered by this deployment-wide key.

    And the trims, which remove backends AND every surface that names them:

    ``bluesky``/``bluesky_web``/``dispatch``/``va_archiver: null``
        The verified spelling for dropping a service block. Every parser gates
        on is-not-None; ``enabled: false`` under a ``services:`` block would
        fail schema validation instead.
    ``virtual_accelerator.live_standin: null``
        The preset ships a live stand-in on: a second virtual accelerator that
        the build installs AS the live machine, deriving the whole ``epics``
        block from it and taking limits checking strict. This lane supplies its
        own live machine — the bench IOC — so leaving the stand-in on collides
        with every ``epics`` key below (the build refuses one fact spelled in
        two places) and stands up a container no scenario here talks to. Nulled
        rather than deleted because an override cannot remove a key.
    ``exclude:``
        A ``-O`` list key UNIONS with the preset's and can never subtract, so
        the artifact trims cannot be expressed by re-listing ``skills:``. The
        two logbook agents are the load-bearing half: they are ARIEL-wired yet
        declare no ``server_dependency``, so nothing auto-disables them when no
        ARIEL is deployed. The three bluesky skills are plain markdown shipped
        verbatim, naming tools the bluesky trim removes.
    ``modules.web_terminals.enabled: false``
        The shipped persona-delta off-switch. Without it the preset emits three
        persona deltas and ``osprey build`` renders FOUR projects, quadrupling
        fixture setup and littering ``build/`` with sibling trees — and the
        session-target state file this module's scenarios read is rooted at the
        base render alone.

    No ``archiver.type`` line: the preset already sets ``mongodb_archiver`` and
    the connector-honesty gate is config-only, so the mock control system the
    agent talks to is a real EPICS connector either way.

    PreToolUse hook's ``permissionDecisionReason``, and
    ``claude_agent_sdk`` 0.2.136 does read that key
    (``_internal/query.py:447``). The Claude Code CLI does not put it on the
    wire for a FILESYSTEM hook: verified 2026-08-24 against CLI 2.1.241, where a
    ``channel_write`` whose approval hook demonstrably returned
    ``permissionDecision: "ask"`` (the render's own ``hook_debug.jsonl`` records
    ``status=ask`` against that exact ``tool_use_id``) reached ``can_use_tool``

    field today is asserting against ``None`` — which is precisely the vacuous
    green this module's FR-7 smoke was placed first to catch.

    The text is not lost, only routed elsewhere. Claude Code writes each hook's
    raw stdout into the session transcript as a ``hook_success`` attachment
    carrying the ``toolUseID`` it gated, so the prompt an operator would have
    read is recoverable exactly, and joins to a tool trace by id rather than by
    guessing at ordering.

    **This helper is meant to retire.** When a CLI populates
    ``decision_reason``, that field becomes the preferred path — it needs no
    disk, no session id, and no transcript layout — and this reader should move
    into ``sdk_helpers`` or disappear. Until then it is the only channel that
    carries the wording, so every scenario asserting on approval text goes
    through it.

    not enough for two of the scenarios here, and the reason is not stylistic:
    **the session target does not outlive a session.** The controls MCP server
    calls ``target_state.write_on_start``, which is a RESET to the deployment
    baseline, so a second SDK query would open a second server, land back on the

    *between* is called with the index of the prompt just finished, before the
