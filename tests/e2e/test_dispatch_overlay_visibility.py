"""Full-stack Docker e2e: overlay skills + the render's ``data/`` are visible in-worker.

This is the authoritative two-party gate for the dispatch-worker image
unification. After unification the worker runs the *project* image
(``<project>:local``, built from the deployment repo via ``COPY .``) rather than
the old lean dispatch image (``<project>-dispatch:local``, still the
dispatcher's own tag) — so the whole repo, the render in ``build/`` included
(facility ``.claude`` overlays, the ``data/`` bundle), is baked into the
container the agent actually runs in. A config-only render (the
pre-unification behaviour) would silently drop both, and no mock can falsify
that: only a live container dispatch proves the overlay artifacts and data files
reached the agent.

The test mutates a freshly initialized control-assistant repo's SOURCE zone
*before* ``osprey build``, so the render carries three things that a
hollow/degraded worker could not satisfy:

  * an OVERLAY SKILL (``skills/facility-marker`` -> rendered to
    ``build/.claude/skills/facility-marker``) that is NOT an OSPREY built-in,
    whose instructions produce an observable marker token;
  * ``data/channel_limits.json`` overwritten with a small fixture carrying a
    distinctive sentinel value, which the render copies to ``build/data/``;
  * a custom ``overlay-visibility`` trigger that routes to the worker, invokes
    the overlay skill, and carries a ``surface_prompt`` fragment.

Firing the trigger and reading the worker's persisted per-run record (its
``tool_calls``, with the tool-call *results* the agent actually loaded
in-container) then proves, deterministically:

  (a) the OVERLAY SKILL was invoked AND present -> a ``Skill`` tool-call
      references facility-marker, and OVERLAY_MARKER (a token that exists only
      inside the baked-in skill file) surfaces in the run;
  (b) the render's ``data/`` was read AND present -> a ``Read`` tool-call
      references channel_limits.json, and DATA_SENTINEL (a token that exists only
      inside the baked-in data file) surfaces in the run;
  (c) the ``surface_prompt`` reached the agent -> the surface token surfaces (the
      surface fragment instructs the agent to emit it, so the token appearing is
      the observable proof the fragment landed in the system prompt).

The tool-call proofs (a)/(b) are robust to report formatting — a ``Read`` result
is the file's own bytes; only (c) depends on agent behaviour.

Gating: needs Docker and ``ALS_APG_API_KEY``. We do NOT gate on a host
``claude`` binary — the CLI lives inside the built image, not on the runner.
