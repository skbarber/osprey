"""e2e proof of the C3 loopback chokepoint over a REAL socket.

Criterion **C3** requires that in the multi-user deployment, every per-user
``osprey web`` app binds ONLY loopback (127.0.0.1) so the nginx reverse proxy
in front of it is the sole off-host path (see
``src/osprey/templates/modules/web_terminals/nginx.conf.j2`` and
``docker-compose.web.yml.j2``, which sets ``OSPREY_TERMINAL_BIND_HOST`` on
every per-user container). Two existing tests each cover only HALF of that
guarantee, and neither one touches a real listening socket:

* ``tests/deployment/web_terminals/test_render.py::
  test_per_user_services_bind_loopback_not_0_0_0_0`` asserts only that the
  rendered compose *artifact text* doesn't contain the string ``"0.0.0.0"``
  with ``OSPREY_TERMINAL_BIND_HOST`` set. It cannot catch a stale/hostile
  image ``CMD`` that passes ``--host 0.0.0.0`` at container-launch time —
  the artifact was never wrong to begin with, so the string-match passes
  regardless of what actually binds at runtime.
* ``tests/cli/test_web_bind.py`` asserts a **stubbed** ``run_web`` receives
  ``host="127.0.0.1"``. It patches out the launch entirely
  (``monkeypatch.setattr("osprey.interfaces.web_terminal.run_web", ...)``),
  so no socket is ever bound and a regression in the real bind call (e.g. a
  typo, or a code path that bypasses ``resolve_bind_host()`` entirely) would
  sail through green.

Neither test is wrong — they're both cheap, deterministic unit tests, and
that's the right shape for most of this logic. But together they leave a real
two-party gap: the CONTRACT ("declared env wins") is tested, and the
ARTIFACT ("compose file doesn't say 0.0.0.0") is tested, but nothing proves
those two facts compose into an actually-closed chokepoint on a live process.

This test closes that gap: it launches a REAL ``osprey web`` subprocess with
the multi-user env declared (``OSPREY_TERMINAL_BIND_HOST=127.0.0.1``) AND a
deliberately hostile ``--host 0.0.0.0`` — exactly the "stale image CMD" attack
this whole mechanism defends against — then proves via real TCP connects that
the server is reachable on loopback but NOT on the machine's routable (LAN)
interface. If ``resolve_bind_host()`` regressed (or some new code path started
honoring ``--host`` again over the declared env), the LAN connect would
SUCCEED and this test would catch it; the two tests above would not.
