"""Real-container e2e for the layered plan catalog (task 1.6, closing
Phase 1 of the plan-catalog epic).

Mocked-client tests (``tests/services/bluesky_bridge/test_plan_loader_layered.py``,
``test_exemplar_plans.py``) only exercise OSPREY's half of the contract: that
the loader in this repo resolves layers and trust tiers correctly in-process.
They never prove that a *deployed* bridge container -- built from the shipped
image, reading its own filesystem layers -- actually serves the same catalog
over HTTP. This is the other half: it deploys a real bluesky-bridge container
and asserts the layered catalog (the shipped plans + an externally-injected
facility plan) is discoverable via ``GET /plans`` with correct
provenance/metadata, and that the browse-only surface around it is honest.

SCOPE, deliberately narrowed: this file proves DISCOVERY, not execution.
Execution has exactly one owner now -- ``tests/e2e/test_bluesky_queue_e2e.py``,
which deploys the whole queue stack (queueserver + Redis + Tiled + the Virtual
Accelerator) and drives real plan runs through arming, drain, abort and restart.
A facility-injected plan is a catalog entry like any other by the time it
reaches the queue, so re-proving execution here would mean standing up a second
VA-backed stack to re-test what that file already covers, at real wall-clock
cost. What this file uniquely proves is that a plan file dropped into a
facility layer is SERVED by a deployed container with the right provenance --
and that the deployment says plainly what it can and cannot do with it.

Uses the ``hello-world`` preset, whose ``control_system.type`` is ``mock``,
rather than the VA-backed stack ``tests/e2e/_orm_stack.py`` builds: the catalog
is connector-independent, so this skips the VA image's slow build entirely
(mirrors ``test_bluesky_deploy.py``'s identical rationale). A mock deployment
is BROWSE-ONLY, which is not a limitation here but part of the subject: plans
are discoverable and composable, the capability record says
``browse_only_connector`` and names the command that flips it, and the queue
refuses to hold work it could never run.

Container safety: every docker invocation below names an exact
container/image -- never a wildcard, never ``system prune``/``--volumes``.
Teardown goes through ``osprey down``, matching every other e2e in
this directory, followed by exact-named removal of this project's own volumes
(``tests/e2e/_volumes.py``): ``down`` keeps them by design, and a rerun must
not inherit their state.

Gating: needs Docker. Much lighter than the VA-backed e2e (no amd64
emulation) -- comparable to ``test_bluesky_deploy.py``'s build+deploy time.
Advisory CI lane (see ci.yml's ``bluesky-catalog-e2e`` job); run locally with
``E2E_REUSE_IMAGES=1`` set for fast iteration once the image cache is warm.
