"""The fastmcp contract the MCP audit layer is built on, pinned in-repo.

``fastmcp`` is declared as a floor with no upper bound (``fastmcp>=3.4.4``),
which is the right dependency shape and also the reason this file exists: a
minor release is free to move anything the audit layer leans on, and three of
those things are load-bearing safety properties rather than conveniences.

1. **The middleware API.** ``Middleware.on_call_tool`` / ``add_middleware`` /
   ``ToolError`` / ``CallToolRequestParams.name`` are what
   :class:`~osprey.mcp_server.audit_middleware.AuditMiddleware` is written
   against. If any of them moves, every tool call stops being recorded and the
   readonly clamp stops applying — silently, because a middleware that is never
   invoked raises nothing.

2. **Settings are an import-time snapshot.** ``fastmcp.settings`` is built when
   ``fastmcp`` is first imported, and it is that snapshot — never the current
   environment — that ``FastMCP.run_async`` consults to pick a transport. The
   whole design of :func:`osprey.mcp_server.startup.fastmcp_transport` rests on
   that being true, and on the first ``fastmcp`` import in ``run_mcp_server``
   landing *after* ``load_dotenv_from_project()``. Both are pinned here in a
   real subprocess, against a project rendered by ``TemplateManager``, because
   an in-process test cannot observe first-import order: by the time pytest has
   collected this file, ``fastmcp`` is long imported.

3. **The skip predicate and the served transport are the same value.** The
   audit middleware is installed only for stdio, so "skipped" must mean "this
   process is visibly not speaking stdio" and never "this process speaks stdio
   without an audit layer". The subprocess cases below assert the predicate,
   the installed middleware chain, and the transport ``server.run()`` actually
   selects, all from one run.

Beyond the library contract, two invariants of our own that no other test
covers end to end, both against a project this file really renders:

* an ``extends`` clone is clamped by the render's own rewritten matchers, on the
  *verified* path — including a clone that pins ``OSPREY_SERVER_NAME`` (which it
  may) and one that tries to pin ``OSPREY_MCP_TOOL_PREFIX`` at a write-free
  server's name (which it may not);
* every server on ``registry.mcp.FRAMEWORK_SERVERS`` reaches its
  ``create_server()`` through ``startup.run_mcp_server``, so the single install
  site really does mean "every framework server is audited".
