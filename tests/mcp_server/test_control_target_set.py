"""The ``control_target_set`` tool: three refusals in order, then a delegation.

The switch itself is pinned by ``test_switch_lifecycle.py`` — real children,
real processes, real spawn-then-swap. What is pinned HERE is the gate in front
of it, and the gate is almost entirely about order and about wording:

* a read-only run is refused FIRST, even when every later check would also
  refuse, because "you cannot switch at all" is the true answer and sending the
  operator off to fix a config key would not be;
* an execution in flight is seen ACROSS a process boundary, through the marker
  file the python executor writes — including the case that makes such a
  mechanism dangerous, a marker left behind by an executor that was killed;
* an ineligible target is refused in the eligibility module's OWN words, so the
  refusal and the roster row can never disagree about why.

The manager fixtures are imported from ``test_switch_lifecycle`` rather than
rebuilt: the two targets it constructs (a mock connector by dotted path for
``live``, a fixture connector registered as ``virtual_accelerator`` for ``va``)
are exactly what a delegation test needs, and a second copy of them would be a
second thing to keep true.
