"""``channel_write`` binds itself to the target it was approved on.

The approval prompt names a target and a generation, read out of the state file
the controls server publishes. Between that prompt and the moment the write
reaches the control system, a target switch can land — and a value approved for
the simulator must never be applied to the real machine because it arrived a
second late.

The tool therefore observes ``(target, generation)`` three times — as the
approval prompt rendered it (from the stamp the hook leaves behind), at entry,
and immediately before the connector call — and refuses on any difference. These
tests drive all three windows:

* the approval window with a stamp file written before the call, which is
  exactly what the hook leaves on disk;
* the execution window by flipping the state inside the connector resolution, a
  real seam of the tool's own execution path that runs after the entry capture
  and before the pre-write re-read — precisely where a switch completing in
  another task would land;
* the published-versus-serving disagreement by giving the connector-host manager
  a started child on a binding the state file does not name.

Every assertion is made on the shipped envelope (the parsed tool result, or the
structured error a refusal raises), never on an internal helper: the envelope is
the only thing an agent or an operator ever sees.
