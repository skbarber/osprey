"""`setup_patch` change classification must not oversell `writes_enabled`.

`control_system.writes_enabled` is enforced at three layers: the PreToolUse hook
(fresh subprocess per call, genuinely re-reads config), the connector (reads the
value through a process-cached config), and the rendered ``permissions.deny``
list in ``settings.json`` (re-rendered only by ``osprey build``). Calling the key
"hot" would tell the operator a patch alone un-gates writes, when in fact writes
stay blocked until a rebuild and restart.

The assertions below pin what each note has to *tell the operator* — the layers
that stay stale and the verb that clears them — rather than the sentence the
product happens to phrase it in. That is deliberate: pinning a literal verb
makes these tests go red when the verb is renamed, even though the contract
they exist to protect has not changed.
