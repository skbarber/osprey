"""D2 invariant pin: the web server's own credentials never reach a child it spawns.

The web server holds several credentials that authenticate *it*: the operator
secret that unlocks a browser session, the panel token that unlocks the
panel-coordination routes, the event-dispatcher and dispatch-worker tokens
(the two legs of the dispatch chain), and the ``*_LAUNCH_TOKEN`` family that
arms a bridge's plan-launch endpoint. Every one of them is a value
that lets its holder act as the server, from outside the tool layer whose
in-tool ``writes_enabled`` re-checks are the actual write-safety authority.

The server also spawns children an agent can influence: the PTY child that runs
an interactive agent session, the SDK operator subprocess, and three sandboxes
that execute agent-authored Python (``python_executor.executor``,
``workspace.execution.sandbox_executor``,
``services.bluesky_bridge.plan_validation``). D2 is the invariant that no
sensitive name crosses from the first list into the second.

**These tests run the real machinery.** No scrub function is mocked and no
child environment is synthesized here: three of them spawn an actual
subprocess and read back what it could actually see, and the credential-pop
test drives a real ASGI request through the real auth middleware. The probe
set is derived from :data:`SENSITIVE_ENV_EXACT` and
:data:`SENSITIVE_ENV_SUFFIXES` rather than typed out, so a credential added to
that module is probed by these tests on the day it is added rather than the
day someone remembers to widen them.

``PATH`` and ``OSPREY_WEB_PORT`` are asserted present in every child
environment as negative controls — except the python-executor sandbox child,
which deliberately drops ``OSPREY_WEB_PORT`` (executor-local drop; the PTY
child keeps it) and therefore uses ``PATH`` alone. Without them a bug that handed a child an
empty environment would make every absence assertion below pass while proving
nothing at all.

**The honesty split.** D2 is not "every sensitive name disappears everywhere".
Two names are genuinely closed in the serving process — the operator secret and
the panel token are taken out of ``os.environ`` and kept only in
``web_auth``'s memory, first by ``_populate`` and then, on every launch shape,
by ``close_env_carriers`` at app construction (which is what covers the
direct-serve ``osprey web``, where a launcher deliberately re-published the
secret for a child that turned out to be this same process). The
event-dispatcher token, the dispatch-worker token and the ``*_LAUNCH_TOKEN``
family deliberately stay in the web server's ``os.environ``, because the server
must inject them upstream into the services it fronts; for those, the strip on
the spawn paths is defence-in-depth for subprocess children and nothing more. That split is encoded below as explicit expected behavior
(:data:`_POPPED_IN_WEB_SERVER` / :data:`_RETAINED_FOR_PROXY_UPSTREAM`), so an
edit that changes which side a name falls on trips a test instead of silently
widening or narrowing what the server keeps.
