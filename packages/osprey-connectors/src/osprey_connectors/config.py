"""Configuration system.

Loads a single YAML config file, resolves environment variables,
and provides dot-path access to values.

**Importing this module does not read ``.env`` and does not touch
``os.environ``.** Building a :class:`ConfigBuilder` does (see its ``load_env``
argument), and that is deliberate — but it must be an *application* that asks
for a config, never the mere act of importing an ``osprey`` module. Loading
``.env`` at import time made a library consumer's environment depend on which
directory the process happened to start in, gave non-credential keys
``override=True`` semantics they were never scoped for, and silently undid
callers' own ``os.environ`` writes depending on import order.

Applications load ``.env`` explicitly at startup: the CLI in
``osprey.cli.main``, MCP servers via :func:`osprey.mcp_env.load_dotenv_from_project`,
and the Claude Code launch paths via
:func:`osprey.build.claude_code_resolver.inject_provider_env`.

    a stale shell export. Every key in the files is passed through, not a
    declared subset — narrowing it would drop Channel Access addressing with no

    The chain is ``.env.shared`` then ``.env``

    The single entry point every project-facing command and deployment step
    uses to read a project's effective config: :class:`ConfigBuilder`, with the
    loader's own INFO chatter quieted. Going through one function is what keeps
    those consumers agreeing on what the config *says* — a caller that
    hand-rolled ``yaml.safe_load`` would resolve ``${VAR}`` without the ``.env``
    passthrough ConfigBuilder performs (see :func:`load_project_dotenv`), and

    could then report on — or render from — a config the deploy would never

    This lives here, next to ``ConfigBuilder``, rather than in a CLI helper
    module: the deployment layer is one of its consumers and imports nothing
    from :mod:`osprey.cli` at module scope, so a CLI home would have made this
    the first such edge.

    Existence checks stay at the call site. ``ConfigBuilder``'s own
    ``FileNotFoundError`` advises setting ``CONFIG_FILE``, which is the wrong

    "no project here" message must check before calling (see

    repo keeps its render one zone down in ``build/`` while its verbs stand at
    the repo root — so a host verb doing in-process work satisfies neither

    one at the call site, which is how a whole archive can be synthesized

    This is the host's half of that contract, and it is deliberately in-process

    ``os.execvpe``-replaces itself with the container runtime, and an exported
