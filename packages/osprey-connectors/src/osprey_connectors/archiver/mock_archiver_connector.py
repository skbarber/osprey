    Mock archiver for development - generates synthetic time-series data.

    This connector simulates an archiver system without requiring real
    archiver access. It generates realistic time-series data for any channel.

    Features:
    - Accepts any channel address
    - Generates realistic time series with texture and noise
    - Values are a pure function of (channel, absolute timestamp), so two
      overlapping windows agree on every timestamp they share
    - Configurable sampling rate and noise level
    - Returns pandas DataFrames matching real archiver format

    Example:
        >>> config = {
        >>>     'sample_rate_hz': 1.0,
        >>>     'noise_level': 0.01
