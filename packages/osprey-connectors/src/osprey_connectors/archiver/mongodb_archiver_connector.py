#: Environment overrides for the two connection keys whose configured value is

#:
#: The contract, stated here because this is the module that opens the socket:
#: **the config block carries the host-side truth** — where the agent, running on
#: the host, reaches the store, which for a project deploying its own store is
#: loopback at the published ``port_host``. Inside the compose network that
#: address names the reading container's own loopback and reaches nothing, so a
#: containerized consumer is given the store's network alias and container port
#: through this pair, and **the environment wins**.
#:
#: That is the ordinary environment-override contract, not a container special
#: case: set in a host shell these win there too, exactly as
#: ``OSPREY_OTEL_OPENOBSERVE_HOST`` does. Compose templates are simply the
#: caller that has a reason to set them.
#:
#: Read by two consumers — this connector and the archiver-recorder service —
#: through :func:`address_overrides`, so both agree on what an empty value means
#: and on how the port is typed.
