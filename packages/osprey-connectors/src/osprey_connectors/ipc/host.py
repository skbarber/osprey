"""The connector-host child: the process that owns the control-system client.

One target, one child. The parent (the controls MCP server) holds no ``libca``
and never sets an ``EPICS_CA_*`` variable of its own; it launches this module,
which builds the real connector through the ordinary
:class:`~osprey_connectors.factory.ConnectorFactory` and serves the proxy
surface over the frame codec. Switching targets is therefore a process
lifecycle operation rather than an in-process reconfiguration, which is the
only way to change an EPICS environment that is read once, process-wide, by a
library that has already loaded.

Launch contract
---------------
The child is spawned as::

    python -m osprey_connectors.ipc.host

with **stdin** and **stdout** connected to pipes and **stderr** left free for
diagnostics. There are no command-line arguments and no configuration in
``argv``: everything arrives on the wire, so nothing about a deployment shows
up in ``ps``.

``stdout`` is the frame channel and carries nothing else. To make that true
regardless of what a control-system library decides to print, the child
duplicates its stdout to a private file descriptor at startup and then points
file descriptor 1 at stderr. A stray ``print()`` — from this module, from
pyepics, from anything imported below — lands on stderr and cannot desynchronise
the stream. Frames are written to the private descriptor with :func:`os.write`.

The init frame
--------------
The **first frame the parent sends** is a request whose method is ``init`` and
whose kwargs are::

    {
      "control_system": {...},          # the full control_system config section
      "target": "live" | "va",          # the session target, never defaulted
      "config_file": "/abs/config.yml", # optional: what CONFIG_FILE to read
      "execution_mode": "readonly"      # optional: restrict this child to reads
    }

``control_system`` is passed whole rather than re-read from disk, so the child
builds from exactly the section the parent resolved against. ``target`` is
resolved to a connector type by :func:`osprey_connectors.types.resolve_target`
— the same shared resolver the parent and the executor sandbox use, so no
holder can decide privately which machine ``live`` means.

Writes are deliberately **not** grantable by launch payload. The connector's
write guard reads the posture of its own connector type from the project config
— ``control_system.connector.<type>.writes_enabled``, which inherits
``control_system.writes_enabled`` when that block says nothing about it — and
``execution_mode`` here can only *add* the ``OSPREY_EXECUTION_MODE=readonly``
claim, never clear an inherited one. A child cannot be talked into writing by
the way it was started; only the deployment's own config enables writes.

Environment scrub
-----------------
Before anything else — before the init frame is read, before the connectors
package is imported — every inherited ``EPICS_CA_*`` and ``EPICS_PVA_*``
variable is removed from ``os.environ``. Ambient environment must never
contribute to what this child talks to: the endpoint is derived by
``connect()`` from the config section alone, and the post-connect report below
is only meaningful because anything left in the environment afterwards was put
there by ``connect()`` itself.

The post-connect report
-----------------------
The **first frame the child sends** is the result frame answering ``init``. It
carries what ``connect()`` actually configured, which is what the parent
asserts its own derivation against::

    {
      "selected_role": "read_only" | "write_access" | None,
      "mode":          "name_server" | "addr_list" | None,
      "host":          str | None,
      "port":          int | str | None,
      "_epics_configured": bool,
      # diagnostics, alongside the five verification fields above
      "connector_type": str,     # what `target` resolved to
      "target":         str,
      "writes_enabled": bool,    # the posture the gateway selection was made
      "readonly_run":   bool,    # on, and the run mode (see below)
      "epics_env":      {...},   # EPICS_CA_*/EPICS_PVA_* set by connect()
      "pid":            int,
    }

``mode``, ``host`` and ``port`` are read back out of the environment
``connect()`` installed, not out of the config that was requested.
``selected_role`` is the gateway role whose configured endpoint matches what
was installed; where both roles name the same endpoint — which makes them
operationally indistinguishable — the tie is broken by the rule ``connect()``
applies (``write_access`` when writes are enabled, a write gateway exists, and
the run is not readonly; otherwise ``read_only``).

``writes_enabled`` is the connector instance's own posture — the deployment
ceiling for its type, ANDed with the run mode and with the operator's narrowing
for this child's target — because that is the value ``connect()`` selected on,
and the parent verifies the reported role against a derivation made with the
same terms. In a readonly run, where that instance value collapses to false for
every type, the deployment half is reported instead and ``readonly_run`` names
the reason.

**A connector that configures no CA environment reports all five as
null/false**, and that is a well-formed report rather than a degraded one: the
mock connector talks to no gateway, so ``selected_role``, ``mode``, ``host``
and ``port`` are ``None`` and ``_epics_configured`` is ``False``. There is
nothing for the parent to verify because there is no endpoint to get wrong.

Served methods
--------------
``read_channel``, ``read_multiple_channels``, ``write_channel``,
``write_multiple_channels``, ``disconnect`` — forwarded to the connector with
the kwargs the frame carried — plus ``spawn_probe``.

A batched read is **one round trip**: ``read_multiple_channels`` fans out
concurrently *inside* the child through the connector's own implementation, so
N channels cost one request frame and one result frame rather than N of each.
Requests are dispatched as tasks and may complete in any order; the parent
matches replies by ``request_id``.

``spawn_probe {channel, timeout}`` is the readiness check the parent runs
against a freshly spawned child before it swaps traffic over: a real read of
one named channel, bounded by ``timeout``, returning that channel's
:class:`~osprey_connectors.control_system.base.ChannelValue`. It is a distinct
method because a probe is allowed to fail without meaning anything is wrong
with the child — a failed probe aborts a switch, and this child keeps serving.

**A request-level failure never kills the child.** Every exception raised while
serving a request is encoded into an error frame for that ``request_id`` by
:mod:`osprey_connectors.ipc.exceptions`, and the serve loop continues.

Lifecycle
---------
The child exits:

- with 0 when stdin reaches **EOF** — the parent closed the pipe or died;
- with 0 after a ``disconnect`` request, once outstanding work has finished and
  the acknowledgement has been written;
- with :data:`EXIT_ORPHANED` when the **watchdog** thread sees
  ``os.getppid() == 1``, meaning it has been reparented to init because its
  parent died without closing the pipe. A polling thread is used rather than a
  signal: ``PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`` does not exist on macOS and there is no
  ``/proc`` to watch, and a thread polling ``getppid()`` behaves identically on
  both platforms;
- with :data:`EXIT_INIT_FAILED` when the first frame is not a usable ``init``
  or the connector fails to connect. Either way a typed error frame naming the
  failure is written first, so the parent learns why rather than seeing only a
  dead process.

Exit is abrupt (:func:`os._exit`) after the streams are flushed: this process
holds a Channel Access context whose interpreter-shutdown handlers can block,
and a child that will not die is worse for the parent than one that skips its
atexit hooks.

        connector: The live connector.
        channel: Channel address to read.
        timeout: Seconds to allow, defaulting to
            :data:`DEFAULT_PROBE_TIMEOUT_S`. The bound is applied here as well
            as being passed to the connector: a control-system client that
            ignores its own timeout must not be able to hang the switch that is
            waiting on this probe.

    Returns:
        The channel's :class:`ChannelValue`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: The bound is not a positive number.
        TimeoutError: The read did not finish inside the bound. The message
            always names the channel and the bound, because the two bounds race
            and ``asyncio.wait_for`` usually wins with a *bare*
            :class:`TimeoutError` — one whose empty message renders, several
            layers up, as a switch refusal ending in ": ." that names nothing
            the operator could act on.
