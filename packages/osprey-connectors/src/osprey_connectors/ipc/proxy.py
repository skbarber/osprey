"""Parent-side proxy for a connector living in the connector-host child.

A tool that reads or writes a channel does not care where the control-system
client library lives. :class:`ConnectorHostProxy` is what makes that true: it
offers the connector call surface tools actually use, and serves each call by
writing a request frame down a pipe and awaiting the matching reply from the
child that owns the real connector. The parent process therefore never imports
``epics``/``p4p`` — which is the entire reason the child exists, since those
libraries cannot be unloaded once loaded and pin the parent to one gateway for
its lifetime. That property is pinned by a test which imports this module in a
fresh interpreter and asserts none of them appeared in ``sys.modules``.

Why this is not a ``ControlSystemConnector`` subclass
----------------------------------------------------
It is a duck type with *exactly* the base class's signatures, not a subclass,
and deliberately so.
:class:`~osprey_connectors.control_system.base.ControlSystemConnector` uses
``__init_subclass__`` to wrap every subclass's ``write_channel`` /
``write_multiple_channels`` in the ``writes_enabled`` pre-check. That guard
belongs *at the connector*, and the connector is in the child: the child
already applies it, in the process that will do the write, against the config
that process was launched with. Inheriting it here would run the check a second
time in the parent — turning a refusal into a fabricated failure result
manufactured on this side of the boundary rather than the real one from the
child, and silently coupling the answer to whichever config the parent happens
to hold. Subclassing would also drag in ``connect()``, ``subscribe()``,
``unsubscribe()``, ``get_metadata()`` and ``validate_channel()`` as abstract
members the proxy has no wire method for. Mirroring the signatures gives tools
substitutability; not inheriting keeps enforcement in exactly one place. A test
compares the signatures parameter-by-parameter so the mirror cannot drift.

``subscribe`` is absent on purpose: nothing in the codebase calls it, and a
proxy method that could not deliver callbacks across the boundary would be a
lie about the surface.

Concurrency
-----------
One background reader task owns the read side of the pipe and demultiplexes
replies to per-request futures by ``request_id``, so several calls may be in
flight at once and replies may arrive in any order. Nothing blocks the pipe
while a call waits.

Failure is fail-closed
----------------------
EOF on the pipe, a stream that will not decode, or the reader task dying for
any other reason ends the proxy: every outstanding call completes with a
:class:`ConnectionError` naming the connector-host child as the cause, and
every later call raises the same. A dead proxy never revives — starting a
fresh child and a fresh proxy is the supervisor's job, not this object's.

Draining, for the target switch
-------------------------------
:meth:`refuse_new_requests` closes the door to *new* calls while leaving the
in-flight ones alone, and :meth:`drain` waits for those to finish with a
deadline. Together they are the handoff surface the runtime target switch uses:
refuse, drain, then disconnect the old child once the last call has landed (or
once the deadline says it never will).
