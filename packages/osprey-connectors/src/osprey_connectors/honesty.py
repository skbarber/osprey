"""The one connector pairing a deployment may not have: invented history.

A virtual accelerator serves channels that move for modelled reasons — a
corrector is stepped, the orbit responds, and the numbers a tool reads back are
answers to what the deployment actually did. The mock archiver answers a history
query the other way round: it synthesizes a plausible-looking series at read
time, for questions nobody recorded the answer to. Configured together they
produce an agent whose past is fiction and whose present is not, with nothing
connecting the two — so the fiction can never be caught by disagreeing with the
machine it claims to describe.

Refused at three independent moments, because a deployment can acquire the
pairing at any of them: ``osprey build`` writes the config, ``osprey up``
stands the services up, and the MCP server reads whatever ``config.yml`` it is
pointed at — including one hand-edited long after the build. Each site raises in
its own vocabulary and names its own fix. What they share, and what lives here,
is the question they ask and the reason they ask it.

**The question is asked twice, because the two kinds of config are read by
different readers, and a guard must resolve a key exactly as the reader it
guards resolves it — otherwise the divergence *is* the bypass.**

- A build profile's ``config:`` block reaches the rendered project through the
  emitter, which honors the dotted spelling (``archiver.type:``, the canonical
  one) *and* a nested mapping — both land on the same rendered leaf. Both are
  therefore live, and :func:`pairing_in_profile` fails closed when they
  disagree: whichever one wins, the profile has stated the archive twice and is
  free to be wrong once.
- A rendered ``config.yml`` is read by :class:`~osprey_connectors.config.ConfigBuilder`
  and by ``MCPServerConfig``, and both walk *nested sections only* — a top-level
  ``archiver.type:`` line there sets nothing at all. So
  :func:`pairing_in_rendered_config` resolves nested-only. A flat line is not
  evidence of an archiver; it is an inert line, and one this module names in its
  message rather than silently reading as "unset", because someone who typed it
  deserves to be told why it did nothing.

Both readers fall back to the mock when their key is absent or blank (see the
factory's ``… is not set; defaulting to …`` warnings), so *unset counts as mock*
at every site. That is the fallback the rule is really about: the common way
into the pairing is not naming the mock, it is naming nothing.

Deliberately *not* a refusal of every mock archiver: a mock control system paired
with the mock archiver is the honest storeless deployment, and it is the app
template's default. Nothing is claimed to be real there, so nothing lies.
