"""Pure time-series synthesis primitives for the simulation engine.

These functions are the stateless computational core behind
:meth:`SimulationEngine.synthesize_series`: they turn a baseline series plus a
scenario's archiver event scripts (step/ramp/spike, positioned by window
fraction, wall-clock offset, or daily time-of-day) into a concrete value series.
They hold no engine state — the engine supplies the channel values and events
and these functions do the math — which keeps the synthesis logic unit-testable
in isolation (see ``tests/simulation/test_series_primitives.py``; the
engine-driven behavior is covered in ``tests/simulation/test_series.py``).
