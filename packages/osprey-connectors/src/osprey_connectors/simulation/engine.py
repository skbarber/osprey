"""Data-driven simulation engine for the mock connectors.

Loads a machine description (``machine.json``) defining channels (baseline
values or derived expressions), scenarios (override sets plus archiver event
scripts), and serves reads, writes, and synthesized time-series for the mock
control-system and archiver connectors.

Value precedence per channel: session write > active-scenario override >
baseline (``value`` or ``expr``). Derived channels recompute on every read
from the *effective* values of referenced channels, so overrides and writes
propagate through the physics couplings automatically.

The active scenarios live in a plain-text ``active_scenarios`` file under the
agent-data root (``agent_data.base_dir``, in its ``simulation/`` subdirectory
— the machine file's own directory is build-owned and checksummed, so mutable
state stays out of it): an optional ``anchor=<ISO8601>`` metadata line followed by
one scenario name per line (``nominal`` is always implicitly first). It is
re-read whenever its mtime changes, and switching (or re-asserting) the set
clears all session-written state (fresh machine). Simultaneously active
scenarios must touch disjoint channel sets (see :meth:`validate_composition`);
their overrides and archiver scripts are merged into one composed view. The
legacy single-name ``active_scenario`` file is still read (one-element list)
for backward compatibility, but writes always target ``active_scenarios``.

        Baseline-value channels yield their baseline with the active scenario's
        archiver events (step/ramp/spike) applied, then the channel's declared
        signal model: ``texture`` (slow baseline wander, riding post-event
        levels), relative ``noise`` (multiplicative sigma) and ``noise_abs``
        (additive sigma). All stochastic terms are deterministic keyed draws
        addressed by (channel, absolute timestamp), so repeated or overlapping
        queries agree pointwise on shared timestamps — with two caveats: noise
        counters are quantized to the nearest millisecond, so sub-millisecond
        timestamps share draws; and when timestamps are not convertible to
        epoch seconds, texture is skipped and noise falls back to sample-index
        counters (deterministic for a given window shape, but without
        cross-window agreement). Expression channels are evaluated pointwise
        over the synthesized series of their referenced channels, so derived
        channels show correlated history.

        Event positioning has three flavors: ``at`` places an event at a fixed
        fraction of whatever window is requested, while ``at_offset`` (with
        ``until_offset`` for ramps) anchors it in wall-clock time, in seconds
        relative to the apply-time anchor T0 (the ``anchor=`` line in the state
        file, falling back to its mtime; negative = past). ``at_time``
        (``"HH:MM:SS"`` in the facility timezone; step/spike only) recurs daily:
        the event fires at that time of
        day on every calendar date inside the requested window. Anchored and
        time-of-day events honor the actual timestamp values, so an event
        outside the requested window does not appear in it. For anchored and
        time-of-day spikes, ``width`` is in seconds.

        Args:
            pv: Channel name.
            timestamps: Timestamps of the requested window (datetime objects
                or epoch seconds). For fraction-positioned events only the
                count matters; anchored events use the actual values.

        Returns:
            List of values, one per timestamp.

        Raises:
            KeyError: If the channel is not defined in the machine file.
