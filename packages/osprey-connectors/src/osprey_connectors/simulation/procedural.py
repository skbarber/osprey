"""Absolute-time procedural synthesis for channels the machine model omits.

The data-driven :class:`~osprey_connectors.simulation.engine.SimulationEngine` serves only
the channels a project's ``machine.json`` declares. Everything else in the
served namespace — 1,872 of the control-assistant preset's 2,908 channels — has
no model, and the Virtual Accelerator falls back to the shared channel taxonomy for
it: ``EngineSource`` serves ``classify_channel(address).base_value`` plus a keyed
noise draw at :meth:`~osprey_connectors.channel_taxonomy.ChannelKind.noise_sigma`. This
module is the archiver-side half of that same fallback — the *history* of a
channel whose live value the VA synthesizes from the taxonomy.

Three properties are contracts, not preferences:

* **Values are a pure function of (channel, absolute epoch seconds).** No
  window, sample count or stream position enters the computation, so two
  archiver queries that share a timestamp return the same value at it, and a
  document written into a store now equals what a query synthesizes for that
  timestamp later. A window-relative generator cannot satisfy either: an
  ``np.linspace(0, 1, n)`` axis makes every value a function of the query's
  shape, so materializing it produces history that contradicts the next read.

* **Baselines come from one source, shared with the VA.** A channel's baseline
  is the value the VA boots it at: the ``machine.json`` seed for the ``:SP`` and
  ``:RB`` channels that carry one (the pyat-coupled and sp-echo partitions), and
  ``classify_channel(...).base_value`` for the rest (the static-noisy partition).
  :func:`baseline_value` is that rule, in one place. This is what makes the
  splice between seeded history and recorded reality seamless: when a recorder
  starts sampling the live machine at T0, the last synthesized sample and the
  first recorded one differ by noise, not by a step an operator would rightly
  read as an event.

* **The excursion is scaled to the channel's declared noise.** Every shape term
  below is expressed in multiples of the channel's own sigma rather than in
  engineering units. A channel the VA serves as a stationary ``base ± 1%`` must
  not have a history that swings 5% and then flatlines the moment recording
  starts — that seam *is* a fabricated anomaly, and a diagnosing agent would be
  right to chase it. :func:`deviation_bound` states the resulting envelope so
  seam assertions can quote it rather than hard-code a number. A
  ``noise_level`` of ``0.0`` is an explicit request for determinism and yields
  the bare baseline, exactly as the VA serves it.

Callers must convert timestamps with
:func:`osprey_connectors.simulation.series.epoch_seconds_array`, the same helper
:meth:`SimulationEngine.synthesize_series` uses. Deriving epoch seconds some
other way (integer-nanosecond division, say) agrees only to within a float ULP,
and the texture terms are continuous functions of that input — so a second
conversion route would silently cost bit-equality between two writers of the
same store.

    * a channel the machine model describes is served from the model — by the
      engine on the static-noisy partition, and as the boot seed
      ``serving.pvdb`` gives a ``:SP``/``:RB`` record on the other two;

      machine, and history claiming 5 kV would be pure invention;
    * everything else is static-noisy telemetry with no model entry, which
      ``EngineSource`` serves from the channel taxonomy.

    ``boot_values`` and gets the anchored baseline for all three fidelity
