            through it.

            **Per-intent human authorization** is a SEPARATE layer at the tool
            boundary: the PreToolUse approval hook (and, for scans, the promote token)
            gate the *intent* to write, once per intent — not once per channel write.

            The two are orthogonal and complementary: the connector cannot be talked
