    Compose implementations disagree about what they do to an ``env_file:``
    value, and the deploy does not get to choose which one reads the file:

    * Docker Compose (measured on v2.34) interpolates the *values*, not just
      the compose document. A ``$`` followed by an identifier character is
      replaced with the named variable's value — the empty string when that
      name is unset — so the container receives a truncated secret while the
      file on disk stays byte-perfect. Two forms carry no warning whatsoever:
      ``$$`` collapses to a single ``$``, and a ``$`` followed by a name that
      *is* set on the deploy host splices the host's value into the secret.
    * podman-compose hands the file to python-dotenv, which resolves only the
      braced ``${...}`` form — and resolves it against an earlier entry in the
      SAME file ahead of the host environment, so the identical file can yield
      a different secret than Docker Compose does.
    * Older podman-compose passes ``--env-file`` to podman, whose parser
      substitutes nothing at all.

    The test is therefore "contains ``$``", not "contains an interpolating
    ``$``". Escaping cannot bridge the set: ``$$`` yields ``$`` where values are
    interpolated and a literal ``$$`` where they are not, so no single file is
    correct everywhere. Which forms count as a reference is compose's business
    and may widen. Refusing ``$`` outright is the only rule that stays true —
    and the one the codebase already designs to
    (``auth_sidecar.passwords.FIELD_SEP``, the minted alphabets in
    :mod:`osprey.deployment.service_tokens`).
