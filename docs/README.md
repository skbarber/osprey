# Documentation screenshots

The committed doc images are regenerated from recipes rather than captured by
hand, and a whole web-interface redesign can be reviewed as a single page.
(For building and link-checking the docs themselves, see
[LOCAL_TESTING.md](LOCAL_TESTING.md).)

## Refreshing documentation screenshots

The committed doc images under `docs/source/_static/screenshots/` are
regenerated from a declarative registry, not captured by hand. Each image is one
`DocShot` recipe in `docs/screenshots/recipes.py` — the authoritative list of
every doc screenshot and how it is produced. List them from the repository root
with:

```console
$ python -m docs.screenshots list
```

**The default is container-free.** `make screenshots` — run from `docs/`, where
the makefile lives — captures only the `standalone_interface` recipes. Each
boots a single interface `create_app()` on a throwaway port, so it needs
neither a container runtime nor seeded data. Regenerate one recipe with
`make screenshots-<name>`. The equivalent without the makefile is
`python -m docs.screenshots` from the repository root, which is what the target
runs for you.

**Two opt-in environments** cover the images that need real data:

- `SCREENSHOTOPTS=--stack` — the ARIEL search/browse/create/status views.
  Builds the `control-assistant` tutorial project, brings up Postgres
  (`osprey up -d`), and seeds the logbook with
  `osprey sim apply nominal --yes --now <anchor>`. Needs a container runtime
  and a free host port 5432. The `--now` anchor freezes the seeded dates, so
  repeat captures are byte-stable.
- `SCREENSHOTOPTS=--agentic` — the Web Terminal hero. Drives a live agent
  session to produce a real beam-current plot, so it needs a live Claude
  session on your subscription budget. Success is a structural check (non-blank
  image, correct viewport, plot present), not a byte comparison.

```console
$ cd docs
$ make screenshots                          # default: standalone only
$ make screenshots SCREENSHOTOPTS=--stack    # + ARIEL views (containers)
$ cd ..
$ python -m docs.screenshots --agentic --only web_terminal_hero
```

**Provenance is automatic.** Every capture stamps `manifest.json` with the
OSPREY version and UTC timestamp, and each figure's *"Captured with OSPREY
vX.Y.Z"* caption is generated from it — never hand-edit the version in a
caption.

This framework is **capture-only**: it is never a CI gate (the stack needs
Postgres; the hero needs a live agent). It is distinct from the CI visual-drift
guard — pixel diffs of each rendered interface against a committed baseline
live in the front-end **Visual** tests (regenerated with `--regen-baselines`),
and continue to run in CI unchanged.

## Reviewing a web-interface redesign (contact sheet)

When a web interface is being restyled, the **contact-sheet renderer** boots the
*real* interface in every theme/mode variant and folds the shots into one
self-contained page, so a whole redesign can be reviewed as a single artifact —
no live agent, provider, hardware, or network. It lives beside the screenshot
framework in `docs/screenshots/` but is a review tool, not a committed doc
image: nothing it produces is checked in or CI-gated.

```console
$ uv run python -m docs.screenshots.contact_sheet --out /tmp/sheet
```

That captures the Web Terminal's four shells — the **dark** and **light**
themes crossed with the **expert** and **simple** UI modes — writes one PNG per
cell into the output directory, composes them into `contact-sheet.html` there,
and prints its path. Open that one file to review every variant side by side.

**Comparing accent candidates.** Add `--accents` to render each of the four
variants twice, once under each accent candidate (blue vs teal), so a pending
accent decision can be made from real output rather than a mockup:

```console
$ uv run python -m docs.screenshots.contact_sheet --out /tmp/sheet --accents
```

To keep every cell looking like a working session with no live backend, the
renderer points the workspace panel at a pre-seeded demo store and replays a
canned terminal transcript. That transcript is width-guarded against the narrow
terminal card — the run fails fast if a line would overflow, before any browser
launches. Where no browser runtime is available the run skips with a one-line
notice instead of erroring.

**Extending it to another target.** The variant grid is the `VARIANTS` list of
`(theme, mode)` tuples near the top of `contact_sheet.py`, and the completeness
invariant `_FULL_MATRIX` mirrors it — add a cell to *both* to capture a new
theme/mode combination. To cover a new panel, seed its backing store the way
`seed_demo_workspace` seeds the workspace artifacts and wire it into
`hermetic_hub` so the panel renders populated; the capture loop and the
composed sheet then pick it up unchanged.
