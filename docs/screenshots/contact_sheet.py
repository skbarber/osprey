"""Hermetic demo-workspace seeding for the web-terminal contact sheet.

The contact-sheet renderer boots the *real* web terminal in every theme/mode
variant so the redesign can be reviewed in one artifact. To make every variant
look like the design mockups without a live agent (no provider, no hardware, no
network), it points the workspace panel at a pre-seeded workspace: a directory
of demo artifacts plus a canned agent transcript replayed into the terminal's
PTY.

This module owns that seed. :func:`seed_demo_workspace` writes an
``artifacts/artifacts.json`` index and its content files into a caller-provided
directory, shaped exactly like a store the product wrote itself, so the workspace
panel's :class:`~osprey.stores.artifact_store.ArtifactStore` loads it through its
own tolerant loader — no live save path, no artifact-server auto-launch. Every
entry shares one fixed :data:`DEMO_SESSION_ID` so the session-scoped panels stay
populated for a single fake session. :data:`DEMO_TRANSCRIPT_PATH` holds the
canned ANSI exchange; :func:`longest_transcript_line_width` guards it against the
narrow (~370px) terminal card.

The seed reads like accelerator control-room work — a storage-ring beam-current
trace and an orbit-response summary — not a generic demo.

:func:`hermetic_hub` composes the seed into the full capture stack: a real
artifacts backend serving the seeded store, and the real web-terminal hub wired
to it with a canned PTY (no live agent, no provider, no hardware).
:func:`capture_contact_sheet` drives a headless browser over that stack once per
entry in :data:`VARIANTS`, then boots every supported subpanel's real app
(:data:`PANEL_SURFACES` — ARIEL, channels, lattice, knowledge, events, and the
Bluesky scan panel) and captures each in the full dark/light ×
expert/simple matrix — always through the hub's own iframe URL shape
(``embedded=true`` + theme + mode), so each card is the panel exactly as the
terminal embeds it — writing one viewport PNG per card.
:func:`compose_contact_sheet` folds them into a single self-contained
``contact-sheet.html`` — a tab strip with one tab per surface (hub first), each
tab holding that surface's 2×2 matrix — the one-click artifact the user
reviews. ``python -m docs.screenshots.contact_sheet --out DIR``
runs it end to end and prints the sheet path; ``--accents`` additionally renders
each hub variant under both accent candidates (blue vs teal) so the pending
accent decision can be made from real output. This
module is import-cheap (plotly/numpy, the interface apps, and Playwright are
imported only where used).
