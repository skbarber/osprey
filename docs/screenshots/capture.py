"""Sync-Playwright runner that turns declarative recipes into committed PNGs.

Each :class:`~docs.screenshots.recipes.DocShot` names an *environment*, a set of
*themes*, a *viewport*, and either a single view (``path``) or one view per
:class:`~docs.screenshots.recipes.SubView`. This module boots the environment,
drives a real headless chromium to every (theme, view) combination, and writes
the resulting screenshots under :func:`output_dir` with filenames that keep byte
parity with the ``.rst`` figures that consume them.

Two environments are dispatched by :func:`run`:

* ``standalone_interface`` — resolve the recipe's ``app_factory``, boot it on a
  throwaway port via :func:`osprey.interfaces._serving.run_app_server`, and
  capture. Zero container, deterministic, the default target.
* ``tutorial_stack`` — delegated to :func:`capture_tutorial_stack`, which owns
  the full container lifecycle: it builds the ``control-assistant`` tutorial
  project, brings up Postgres detached, seeds ARIEL at the frozen anchor, and
  captures either the static ARIEL views or the agentic web-terminal hero. In an
  environment without that runtime (no ``osprey`` binary, no container engine,
  Postgres never ready) it raises :class:`ScreenshotSkip` so a ``--stack`` run
  degrades to a clean one-line notice instead of a traceback.

The whole run shares one browser; missing chromium/Playwright is reported as a
one-line skip rather than a traceback.
