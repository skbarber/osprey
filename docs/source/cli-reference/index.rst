CLI Reference
=============

Complete reference for all Osprey Framework CLI commands.

**Prerequisites:** Framework installed (``uv sync``)

Overview
========

All commands are accessed through the ``osprey`` command.

A deployment is a git repository: ``profile.yml`` at its root is the source you
edit, ``build/`` is what a build renders from it, and ``var/`` is durable state.
The lifecycle verbs find that repository by walking up from wherever you are
standing, so none of them has to be told where it is; ``--repo DIRECTORY``
names another one explicitly.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey --version          # Show framework version
   osprey init               # Create a deployment repo from a preset
   osprey set KEY=VALUE      # Write a setting into profile.yml
   osprey validate           # Check profile.yml without building
   osprey build              # Render build/ from profile.yml
   osprey up                 # Start the deployment, as built
   osprey down               # Stop it, keeping all data
   osprey restart            # Stop and start it again
   osprey status             # Show what it is doing
   osprey logs               # Show its container logs
   osprey reset              # Wipe it back to a fresh state
   osprey config             # Show the deployment configuration
   osprey chat               # Talk to this deployment's agent

Global Options
==============

``--version``
   Show framework version and exit.

``-v, --verbose``
   Show debug output, including every container command run. The transcript
   takes the place of the progress report rather than joining it, so under
   ``-v`` no phase or step lines are printed at all. Without it, a run prints
   the progress report and the command's own output only; log records below
   WARNING never reach the screen, though they still reach every sink the
   deployment configures.

``--help``
   Show help for any command (e.g., ``osprey build --help``).

osprey init
===========

Create a deployment repository from a bundled preset.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey init [DIRECTORY] --preset NAME [OPTIONS]

``DIRECTORY`` is the repository the deployment lives in, and its name *is* the
deployment's name. Omit it to initialize the current directory in place, which
is how a repository cloned empty from a forge is filled in.

The repository holds four zones — source you edit, secrets, disposable build
output, and durable state:

.. code-block:: text

   DIRECTORY/
     profile.yml                    the manifest; everything the preset configures
     data/ personas/ triggers.yml   the material it names — yours to edit
     .env                           provider keys, seeded from your shell
     build/                         rendered by `osprey build`; gitignored
     var/                           agent memory and audit log; gitignored

``git init`` and an initial commit run at the end, unless a git repository
already encloses the target or ``--no-git`` is given.

``--preset NAME`` — Bundled preset to materialize.

``--list-presets`` — List bundled preset names and exit.

``-O, --override FILE`` — Layer a YAML file on top of the preset before writing
(repeatable, in order).

``--set KEY.PATH=VALUE`` — Inline scalar/list override baked into the emitted
profile (repeatable). RHS is parsed as YAML. Top-level shorthands: ``provider``,
``model``, ``channel_finder_mode``, ``connector``.

``--force`` — Re-materialize the source zone of an existing deployment
repository, discarding edits to ``profile.yml``, ``data/``, ``personas/``,
``triggers.yml``, ``web-terminal-context/``, and ``.env.example``. Never touches
``.env``, ``.git``, ``var/``, ``build/``, ``.gitignore``, ``README.md``,
``ci-extra.yml``, the CI file, or ``scripts/verify.sh``.

``--no-git`` — Skip ``git init`` and the initial commit.

``--up`` / ``-d, --detach`` / ``--dev`` — Build and start the deployment right
away, optionally in the background or in development mode.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey init --list-presets
   osprey init als-assistant --preset control-assistant
   osprey init demo --preset control-assistant --up -d --dev

osprey set
==========

Write settings into the deployment profile.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey set KEY=VALUE... [--repo DIRECTORY]

Each ``KEY=VALUE`` is written into this repository's ``profile.yml`` in place,
comments intact. That file is the source of truth, so this is the only command
that edits configuration for you — the rendered ``build/config.yml`` is
generated from it and is never hand-edited. Run ``osprey build`` to carry a
setting through to ``build/``, then ``osprey up`` to deploy it.

``KEY`` is a top-level profile key (``provider``, ``model``, ``tier``,
``channel_finder_mode``, ``connector``) or a dotted path. Keys under ``config.``
address the rendered config: ``config.control_system.type=epics`` writes that
literal dotted entry into the profile's ``config:`` block. ``VALUE`` is read as
YAML, so ``true``/``false`` become booleans and bare numbers become numbers.

Two shorthands stand in for longer key paths: ``connector=`` writes
``config.control_system.type``, and ``epics_gateway=`` writes a known facility's
EPICS gateway addresses. (Control systems beyond the bundled ones are reachable
through custom connector packages — see :doc:`/how-to/add-connector`.)

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey set model=sonnet
   osprey set connector=epics
   osprey set tier=1 channel_finder_mode=in_context
   osprey set config.facility.name='ALS Storage Ring'
   osprey set epics_gateway=als
   osprey set --repo ~/als-assistant config.control_system.writes_enabled=true

osprey validate
===============

Check the deployment profile without building.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey validate [TARGET] [--repo DIRECTORY]

With no argument, validates the deployment repository enclosing the working
directory. ``TARGET`` names a different profile to check instead — a persona
delta file under ``personas/``, or a directory holding a ``profile.yml``.

Resolves ``extends:`` chains and runs the full consistency check — convention
directories, the ``data:`` tree, service templates, lifecycle steps, env vars —
then lints the declared web stack against the config a build would render. Every
problem found is reported, not just the first. Exits 0 when the profile is
valid, 2 with the accumulated errors when it is not, so a CI job can gate on it.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey validate
   osprey validate personas/reader.yml
   osprey validate --repo ~/als-assistant

osprey config
=============

Show the deployment configuration.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey config [--rendered | --defaults] [--repo DIRECTORY]

With no flag, prints the source ``profile.yml`` — the tracked, hand-edited
manifest — exactly as it is on disk, comments included. Output is piped through
unchanged when stdout is not a terminal. This command only reads; to change a
setting, use ``osprey set``.

``--rendered`` — Show the built ``config.yml`` the deployment actually runs on.

``--defaults`` — Show the framework's default template, with every key the
framework understands and its default. Needs no deployment repository.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey config
   osprey config --rendered
   osprey config --defaults > defaults.yml

osprey profile
==============

Validate and inspect build profiles. The profile is the durable, facility-owned
source a deployment is built from — see :doc:`/how-to/build-profiles`.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey profile validate TARGET
   osprey profile presets

``osprey profile validate TARGET``
   Check a profile without building anything. ``TARGET`` is a directory holding
   a ``profile.yml`` or a path to a profile file. Resolves ``extends:`` chains
   and reports every problem found — convention directories, the ``data:``
   tree, service templates, lifecycle steps, env vars. Exits 0 when valid, 2
   with the accumulated errors when not. Inside a deployment repository, plain
   ``osprey validate`` checks that repository without naming a target.

``osprey profile presets``
   List bundled preset names, one per line. Every name printed is usable as
   ``--preset NAME`` for ``osprey init``.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey profile presets
   osprey init my-facility --preset control-assistant --set model=opus
   cd my-facility
   osprey validate
   osprey build

osprey build
============

Render this deployment repository's ``build/`` from its profile.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey build [OPTIONS]

Run it with no arguments, anywhere inside a deployment repository. It walks up
to the repository's ``profile.yml`` and renders the whole output zone from it:
``config.yml``, the Osprey agent artifacts, the data tree, the service templates
and the compose files that deploy them.

``build/`` is derived in full and holds nothing durable — your keys are in
``.env``, the agent's memory is in ``var/`` — so every build wipes and
re-renders it. The render lands in ``build/.tmp`` and replaces ``build/`` only
once it has succeeded, so a build that fails, or one you interrupt, leaves the
previous build exactly as it was and still able to stop the stack it started.

It renders files, never containers: rebuild while the stack is up and the change
takes effect at the next ``osprey up`` or ``osprey restart``.

``-s, --stream`` — Stream lifecycle step output in real time.

``--skip-lifecycle`` — Skip the profile's ``pre_build``, ``post_build``, and
``validate`` steps.

``--skip-deps`` — Skip venv creation and dependency installation (CI mode).

``--runtime-root PATH`` — Override ``project_root`` in the rendered config, for
a build whose output runs somewhere other than where it was made.

``--repo DIRECTORY`` — Deployment repository to act on (default: the nearest
``profile.yml`` at or above the working directory).

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey build
   osprey build --repo ~/deployments/als-assistant
   osprey build --skip-lifecycle --skip-deps          # CI: no venv, no hooks

Lifecycle verbs
===============

``osprey up``, ``down``, ``restart``, ``status``, ``logs`` and ``reset`` run the
deployment's container stack. Each one takes ``--repo DIRECTORY`` and otherwise
needs no arguments: run it anywhere inside the deployment repository.

osprey up
---------

Start this deployment from ``build/``, as built.

It starts what the last ``osprey build`` rendered and re-renders nothing from
``profile.yml``, so the services that come up are always the ones you can read
on disk. It reads ``profile.yml`` for one thing: a fingerprint. If the profile
has changed since the build, ``up`` refuses and says what moved, because
starting would deploy something other than what the profile now describes.

One exception, by design: a deployment with web terminals re-renders that stack
at every start — its compose file, nginx config, landing page, and any persona
whose project is missing. Those follow the user roster rather than the build, so
a roster edit takes effect on the next start.

Whether the deployment is reachable off-host is a property of the build, not of
this command: the bind address is rendered into every published port. Change it
with ``osprey set deployment.bind_address=0.0.0.0``, then rebuild.

``-d, --detached`` — Run services in the background.

``--dev`` — Bake the local osprey checkout into the images instead of the
published release.

``--build`` — Re-render ``build/`` from ``profile.yml`` first, then start it.

``--as-built`` — Start ``build/`` as it was rendered, even though ``profile.yml``
has moved on.

``--keep-archiver-base`` — Keep the existing archiver history even when the
profile's retention/cadence knobs no longer match it.

osprey down
-----------

Stop this deployment, keeping all data. It renders nothing; destroying data is
``osprey reset``, which asks first.

If ``build/`` is gone or was never rendered, ``down`` does not re-derive the
compose files from ``profile.yml`` — those describe what would be started now,
not what is running. Instead it stops the containers this repository labelled as
its own, which is the recovery path for a ``build/`` deleted while the stack was
up. Containers are labelled when they are *created*, so a stack started before
this labelling existed cannot be found that way; run ``osprey build`` to restore
``build/`` and ``down`` works normally again.

osprey restart
--------------

Stop and start this deployment again. Takes the same options as ``up``:
``-d/--detached``, ``--dev``, ``--build``, ``--as-built``,
``--keep-archiver-base``.

osprey status
-------------

Show what this deployment is doing. It reads and reports — it starts nothing,
stops nothing and renders nothing — so it is safe to run against a live stack at
any time.

Four sections. **Build** says whether ``build/`` still matches ``profile.yml``,
the same check ``osprey up`` refuses on, and which version of osprey rendered it.
**Containers** is what the container runtime reports, not what compose thinks
should exist. **Endpoints** is where the services are declared to answer.
**Agent** is the provider, whether its credential can be found, and whether the
rendered agent files still match the config.

``--agents`` — Also show the per-subagent model assignments.

osprey logs
-----------

Show this deployment's container logs, and step out of the way: ``-f`` streams,
Ctrl-C stops it, piping into other commands works, and the exit code is the
runtime's own. Both halves of a deployment are covered — the services and, when
there is one, the web-terminal stack.

``-f, --follow`` — Keep streaming new output until interrupted.

``--tail INTEGER`` — Show only the last N lines per container.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey logs
   osprey logs event-dispatcher -f
   osprey logs --tail 50

osprey reset
------------

Wipe this deployment back to a fresh state. It stops the stack, removes the
containers, volumes and images carrying this checkout's identity, destroys the
agent's memory under ``var/agent_data/``, strips the tokens ``osprey up`` minted
out of ``.env``, and deletes ``build/``.

Two things survive, and the plan says so before you confirm: ``var/audit/``, the
safety audit log, and everything in ``.env`` that a deploy did not mint — your
provider keys. The source zone is never touched: ``profile.yml``, ``data/``,
``personas/``, ``triggers.yml`` and ``.git`` are exactly what they were.

Reset removes a container or volume only when it also carries this repository's
identity label, and refuses outright — removing nothing — when it finds
same-named resources created from a different path.

``--dry-run`` — Show the removal plan and stop. Nothing is stopped, removed, or
written.

``-y, --yes`` — Skip the typed confirmation. The plan is still printed.

``--purge-audit`` — Destroy ``var/audit/`` as well. It is kept by default.

Exit status: ``0`` the reset did what it said (or there was nothing to do),
``1`` you declined or it refused, ``3`` it ran but the deployment is only partly
reset, with each survivor named above the exit.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey up -d
   osprey status
   osprey up --build -d
   osprey restart --dev
   osprey logs -f
   osprey down
   osprey reset --dry-run

osprey users
============

Manage this repository's web-terminal users. A multi-user deployment gives each
person on the roster their own web terminal, container and workspace volumes;
these verbs act on that roster, which lives in the profile. Every verb takes
``--repo DIRECTORY``.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 46 32

   * - Verb
     - What it does
     - Also accepts
   * - ``remove USER``
     - Retire one person: remove their web-terminal workspace.
     - ``--archive``, ``--purge``, ``-y/--yes``
   * - ``prune``
     - Remove workspaces for people no longer on the roster.
     - ``--archive``, ``--purge``, ``-y/--yes``, ``--dry-run``
   * - ``seed [USER]``
     - (Re)seed workspaces from the roster; ``USER`` targets one person, omit
       to reseed all.
     - —
   * - ``passwd USER``
     - Change one user's login password (password authentication only).
       Prompts without echoing, and ends that user's sessions.
     - —
   * - ``env``
     - Render ``.env.users``, the env file every per-user container runs
       with.
     - ``--env-file``, ``-o/--output``

``--archive`` -- Archive a user's workspace before removing it (mutually exclusive with ``--purge``).

``--purge`` -- Permanently delete a user's workspace without archiving it (mutually exclusive with ``--archive``).

``-y, --yes`` -- Assume yes to confirmation prompts.

``--dry-run`` -- Show what would happen without making changes.

``osprey users env`` renders the same subset a deploy would generate, from the
same two inputs — the rendered deploy config and the repository root's env
chain (``.env.shared`` then ``.env``, so ``.env`` wins on a key both set) — so
a file rendered here and one generated by ``osprey up`` cannot disagree. Values
come only from those files, never from the surrounding environment.
``--env-file PATH`` renders from that one file instead of the chain.
``-o/--output PATH`` writes the result at mode ``0600`` instead of to stdout;
unlike a deploy, which never overwrites an existing ``.env.users``, an
explicit ``--output`` is taken as an instruction and replaces what is there. In
CI, pass it: without ``--output`` the assembled secrets go to the job log.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey users remove alice --archive
   osprey users prune --dry-run
   osprey users seed alice
   osprey users passwd alice
   osprey users env --output .env.users

See :doc:`/how-to/deploy-a-facility` for the walkthrough that uses these
verbs end to end.

osprey health
=============

Run comprehensive system health check.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey health [OPTIONS]

``--project DIRECTORY`` -- Deployment repository or rendered project directory (default: the repository enclosing the current directory).

``-v, --verbose`` -- Show per-warning and per-error details in the summary.

``--json`` -- Emit the report as a single JSON document on stdout.

``--category NAME`` -- Run only the named category (repeatable).

``--full`` -- Also run on-demand categories (live model chat, pinned CLI download).

osprey chat
===========

Talk to this deployment's agent. See :doc:`/how-to/use-cli-chat`.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey chat [PROMPT] [OPTIONS]

Starts the agent in the deployment's ``build/`` directory, wired to the
provider, control system and facility knowledge that build was rendered with.
``PROMPT``, when given, is the opening message — with ``--print`` it is answered
and the command exits, which is the shape a script wants.

Nothing is re-rendered: ``osprey build`` owns that. When the profile has changed
since the last build, a warning says so and the session starts anyway against
the build as it stands.

``--resume SESSION_ID`` — Resume a previous agent session by ID.

``--print`` — Print the answer and exit.

``--effort [low|medium|high|max]`` — Reasoning effort (default:
``claude_code.effort`` from the build).

``--no-pin`` — Ignore ``claude_code.cli_version`` and use the installed agent CLI.

``--repo DIRECTORY`` — Deployment repository to act on.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey chat
   osprey chat --print "what is the stored beam current?"
   osprey chat --resume abc123
   osprey chat --repo ~/als-assistant

osprey eject
============

Copy framework services to your project for customization.

``osprey eject list``
   List all ejectable framework capabilities and services.

``osprey eject service NAME [--output PATH] [--include-tests]``
   Copy a framework service directory locally.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey eject list
   osprey eject service channel_finder --include-tests

osprey channel-finder
=====================

Tools for building, validating, previewing, and serving control system
channel databases.

Options: ``--project PATH``, ``-v, --verbose``

``osprey channel-finder build-database``
   Build a channel database from a CSV file.

``osprey channel-finder validate``
   Validate a channel database JSON file.

``osprey channel-finder preview``
   Preview a channel database with flexible display options.

``osprey channel-finder generate [--output-dir DIR] [--source PATH] [--format in_context|hierarchical|middle_layer|all] [--tier 1|3|none] [--validate]``
   Generate channel databases from a hierarchical template. Produces one
   or more pipeline formats (default: all three) with optional tier filtering.

``osprey channel-finder benchmark --model PROVIDER/WIRE_ID [--queries SPEC] [--runs-per-query N] [--concurrency N] [--output-dir DIR] [--queries-path PATH] [-v]``
   Run the benchmark harness against a channel-finder pipeline using a
   LiteLLM-form model id (e.g. ``anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5``). Saves per-run
   JSON results for accuracy/cost analysis.

``osprey channel-finder web``
   Launch the Channel Finder web interface.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey channel-finder build-database
   osprey channel-finder validate
   osprey channel-finder preview
   osprey channel-finder generate --format hierarchical
   osprey channel-finder benchmark --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
   osprey channel-finder web

osprey ariel
============

Manage the ARIEL logbook search service.

``quickstart [--source PATH]`` -- Full setup: migrate and ingest demo data.

``status [--json]`` -- Show service status.

``migrate`` -- Create or update database tables.

``sync [--limit N]`` -- Idempotent migrate + incremental ingest + enhance.
Safe to run on every build; on a fresh database, runs a full ingest.

``ingest --source PATH [--adapter TYPE] [--since DATE] [--limit N] [--dry-run]``
   Ingest logbook entries from file or URL.

``watch [--source] [--once] [--interval N] [--dry-run]`` -- Poll for new entries.

``enhance [--module NAME] [--force] [--limit N]`` -- Run enhancement modules.

``models`` -- List embedding models and tables.

``search QUERY [--mode keyword|semantic|hybrid] [--limit N] [--json]``
   Execute a search query. Without ``--mode``, the deployment's
   ``ariel.default_search_mode`` decides.

``reembed --model NAME --dimension N [--batch-size N] [--force]``
   Re-embed entries with a different model.

``web [--port N] [--host ADDR] [--reload]`` -- Launch web interface.

``purge [--yes] [--embeddings-only]`` -- Delete all ARIEL data.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey ariel quickstart
   osprey ariel search "RF cavity fault"
   osprey ariel web --port 8080

osprey artifacts
================

Manage the OSPREY Artifact Gallery -- a local web gallery that displays
interactive plots, tables, and other outputs produced by the Osprey agent during
analysis sessions. Artifacts are written by the Osprey agent via ``save_artifact()`` in
``osprey execute`` or the ``artifact_save`` MCP tool.

``osprey artifacts web [OPTIONS]``
   Launch the Artifact Gallery web interface. Starts a FastAPI server on
   ``http://127.0.0.1:8086`` by default.

   ``-p, --port INTEGER`` — Port (default: from ``config.yml`` or ``8086``).

   ``-h, --host TEXT`` — Host to bind to (default: from ``config.yml`` or
   ``127.0.0.1``).

   ``--reload`` — Enable auto-reload for development.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey artifacts web                    # Start on localhost:8086
   osprey artifacts web --port 9000        # Custom port
   osprey artifacts web --host 0.0.0.0     # Bind to all interfaces
   osprey artifacts web --reload           # Development mode

osprey web
==========

Launch the Web Terminal interface. See :doc:`/how-to/web-terminal/operate`.

``osprey web [OPTIONS]``
   Start the web terminal server (default: ``http://127.0.0.1:8087``).

   ``-p, --port INTEGER`` — Port (default: from config or 8087).

   ``--host TEXT`` — Host to bind to (default: ``127.0.0.1``).

   ``--shell TEXT`` — Shell command to run (default: ``claude``).

   ``--repo PATH`` — Deployment repo to act on (default: nearest ``profile.yml`` at or above cwd).

   ``--detach`` — Run in background (PID written to ``.osprey-web.pid``).

   ``--reload`` — Auto-reload for development.

``osprey web stop``
   Stop a background web terminal server.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey web
   osprey web --port 9000 --host 0.0.0.0
   osprey web --detach
   osprey web stop

osprey theme-lab
================

Design a theme in the browser. Starts a local server for OSPREY's design
system and opens the Theme Lab, where you pick an accent color and see it
previewed live on dark and light mock-ups of the web terminal, with contrast
badges that update as you go. Copying the export block gives you a
ready-to-paste description of the theme to request; the lab itself does not
write theme files. See :doc:`/how-to/web-terminal/theming`.

``osprey theme-lab [OPTIONS]``
   Serve the Theme Lab and open it. The URL is printed as well, so the page can
   be opened by hand if no browser appears.

   ``-p, --port INTEGER`` — Port to serve on (default: an unused port chosen
   automatically).

   ``--no-browser`` — Do not open a browser window; print the URL only.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey theme-lab
   osprey theme-lab --port 9000
   osprey theme-lab --no-browser

osprey audit
============

Audit a build profile or project directory for safety risks. Uses an AI
reviewer to analyze permissions, hooks, MCP server configs, convention
directories, and lifecycle scripts.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey audit TARGET [OPTIONS]

``--build`` — Build a profile in a temp directory, then audit the result.

``--model TEXT`` — Model for the reviewer agent.

``--budget FLOAT`` — Maximum budget in USD.

``-v, --verbose`` — Show verbose output.

``--json`` — Output as JSON.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey audit my-project/
   osprey audit profile.yml --build
   osprey audit project/ --json

osprey scaffold
===============

Emit the repository's CI files and manage build artifact ownership.
Framework-managed build artifacts (agents, rules, etc.) can be claimed
per-facility for in-place editing. A claim moves the artifact out of the build
zone and into the profile beside it; the next build copies it back and registers
it as user-owned, so a rebuild leaves your version alone.

All subcommands accept a common flag:

``--repo DIRECTORY`` — Deployment repository to act on (default: the nearest
``profile.yml`` at or above the working directory).

``osprey scaffold ci [--force]``
   Emit this repository's CI pipeline and health check from the profile's
   ``deploy:`` block: the pipeline at the repository root and the post-deploy
   health check at ``scripts/verify.sh``. Run it again whenever the block
   changes. Re-running is safe — a file whose content already matches is left
   untouched, stamp included, so an OSPREY upgrade alone produces no diff. A
   file the scaffolder did not write is reported and left alone unless
   ``--force`` is given. ``ci-extra.yml`` is never touched: it is yours, and the
   pipeline includes it.

``osprey scaffold list``
   List all build artifacts and their ownership status (framework vs.
   user-owned).

``osprey scaffold claim NAME``
   Move an artifact out of ``build/`` and into the repository's profile, into
   the convention directory for its kind (``rules/safety.md``,
   ``skills/orbit-check/``, ``services/postgresql/``, ``hooks/my-guard``). A
   file moves as a file; skills and services move as whole directories. The
   build copy is *moved*, not copied — it lives in one place until the next
   ``osprey build`` renders it again.

   Refused, with the reason: a **generated** artifact rather than an authored one —
   ``CLAUDE.md``, ``.claude/settings.json``, ``.mcp.json``,
   ``hook_config.json`` — where the message names the config key that does
   control it; and a profile slot that is already occupied. See
   :ref:`profile-claim`.

``osprey scaffold diff NAME``
   Show a unified diff between the current framework template (re-rendered)
   and your file at the canonical output path. For a claimed service
   directory, diffs every file in the directory against the packaged
   template.

``osprey scaffold unclaim NAME``
   Release ownership and restore framework management. The next build overwrites
   the file with the framework template. Ownership a build derived from the
   profile is re-registered by the next build, so this holds only until then —
   give the artifact up for good by deleting it from the profile's convention
   directory.

``osprey scaffold web-terminals lint [--repo PATH]``
   Validate the deployment's ``modules.web_terminals`` stanza (port-family
   allocation, reserved service names, duplicate users, persona references).
   Exits non-zero on error-severity findings; warnings do not fail the check,
   so it is safe to wire into a CI gate.

``osprey scaffold web-terminals render [--repo PATH] -o DIRECTORY``
   Render the multi-user deployment artifacts (docker-compose overlay, nginx
   routing fragment, static landing page) into ``-o/--output``. Lints first by
   default and aborts on errors; ``--no-lint`` skips the pre-check.

   Both verbs read the stanza from the repository's built ``config.yml``.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey scaffold ci                             # Re-emit the CI files
   osprey scaffold list                           # Show all artifacts
   osprey scaffold claim agents/channel-finder    # Claim for editing
   osprey scaffold claim services/postgresql      # Freeze a service template
   osprey scaffold diff agents/channel-finder     # Compare yours vs framework
   osprey scaffold unclaim rules/safety           # Restore framework management
   osprey scaffold web-terminals lint             # lint this project's stanza
   osprey scaffold web-terminals render -o deploy/

osprey skills
=============

Manage bundled Osprey skills — agent skills shipped with OSPREY that
can be installed either globally or into a specific project's
``.claude/skills/`` directory.

``osprey skills install NAME [--target PATH]``
   Install a bundled skill into ``<target>/<name>/`` (defaults to
   ``~/.claude/skills/<name>/``). If the target already exists and is
   non-empty, the prior content is renamed to
   ``<name>.bak.<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>/`` before the new copy is written, so a
   previous version is never lost.

   ``--target PATH`` — directory to install into. Tilde is expanded. Use a
   project-local ``.claude/skills/`` path to scope the skill to one repo
   (e.g., a facility repository's ``.claude/skills/``). Omit for the global
   install.

   Currently supported skills:

   * ``osprey-build-interview`` — guided facility-repository generation (see
     :doc:`/getting-started/osprey-build-interview`). Typically installed globally
     so it is available in any Osprey agent session.
   * ``osprey-contribute`` — walks a contributor through the GitHub Flow
     journey from a working-tree change to a merged PR on ``main`` (branching,
     atomic commits, push, PR, rebase, merge).
   * ``osprey-pre-commit`` — runs the quick / ci / premerge check scripts at
     the right gate before committing, pushing, or opening a PR.
   * ``osprey-release`` — cuts a CalVer release: opens the version-bump PR,
     tags the merge commit, and verifies the automated PyPI publish.
   * ``osprey-design-philosophy`` — OSPREY's design and architecture principles
     for designing, adding, or reviewing a feature. Useful for framework
     contributors; install globally to have it available when working on
     ``src/osprey`` in any session.
   * ``creating-an-osprey-panel`` — author a themed, token-only web-terminal
     panel.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey skills install osprey-build-interview
   osprey skills install creating-an-osprey-panel --target .claude/skills/

osprey vendor
=============

Manage locally bundled vendor assets (JS/CSS/fonts) for firewalled
deployments. By default OSPREY interfaces load third-party libraries directly
from CDN; set ``OSPREY_OFFLINE=1`` (or ``offline: true`` in ``config.yml``) to
switch the interfaces over to local bundles.

``osprey vendor fetch [OPTIONS]``
   Download all vendor assets declared in the manifest into
   ``static/vendor/``. Run once on firewalled deployments before starting
   ``osprey web`` with ``OSPREY_OFFLINE=1``. In default CDN mode this command
   is optional.

   ``-q, --quiet`` — Suppress per-file output.

   ``-k, --insecure`` — Skip TLS cert verification. Every asset is still
   checked against its manifest SHA256, so this is safe behind corporate
   proxies (e.g. Squid) that intercept TLS. Also enabled via
   ``OSPREY_VENDOR_INSECURE=1``.

``osprey vendor verify``
   Verify all vendor assets exist on disk with correct SHA256 checksums.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey vendor fetch                    # Download all assets
   osprey vendor fetch --insecure         # Behind a TLS-intercepting proxy
   osprey vendor verify                   # Check checksums

Environment Variables
=====================

.. code-block:: bash

   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...          # Or OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, etc.

Provider keys live in the deployment repository's ``.env`` and are read from
there. No environment variable selects which deployment a command acts on:
every lifecycle verb finds the repository by walking up from the working
directory, and ``--repo DIRECTORY`` names another one.
