Osprey Framework Documentation
================================

**An agentic interface to scientific control systems.**

The **Osprey Framework** is an agentic interface and harness for scientific facilities managing complex technical infrastructure — particle accelerators, fusion experiments, beamlines, and large telescopes. It wraps a coding agent in an operator-facing safety policy, a hook-based approval chain, and an MCP-server multiplexer, so the agent layer, the underlying LLM, and the compute backend are each replaceable without changing what the operator sees. The current reference implementation is a browser-based operator workstation; other surfaces (control-room consoles, chat clients, headless services) are possible.

Osprey addresses control-specific challenges: semantic addressing across large channel namespaces, :doc:`protocol-agnostic integration with control stacks <how-to/add-connector>` (EPICS and Mock ship in-tree; LabVIEW, Tango, and other stacks are supported via custom connectors), :doc:`logbook search <how-to/ariel/index>` across facility electronic logbooks, and mandatory human oversight for safety-critical operations.
