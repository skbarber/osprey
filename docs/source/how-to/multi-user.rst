==================
Multi-User Support
==================

The multi-user Web Terminal turns one OSPREY project into a small shared
product: a landing page where each member of your team picks their name, and a
private, containerized Web Terminal behind each card — all served from a single
host, brought up with a single ``osprey up``.

.. dropdown:: What You'll Learn
   :color: primary
   :icon: book

   - How it sits beside the single-user ``osprey web`` workflow, and when each
     mode is the right tool
   - The three ideas behind the multi-user stack: one container per user,
     personas as capability tiers, and one nginx front door
   - The ``modules.web_terminals`` config block that switches it on
   - Standing the preset's full stack up — two control-room tiers plus a
     standalone ARIEL terminal — and watching the write boundary refuse — and
     approve — a real write
   - Day-to-day operations: adding, reseeding, and removing users
   - How to require a login — passwords OSPREY manages, or your facility's
     single sign-on

   **Prerequisites:** The concepts need none. To stand the stack up you'll
   want Docker (or Podman) and your model-provider credentials — the
   ``control-assistant`` preset ships the whole block pre-wired.

Single-user is the front door
=============================

The everyday workflow stands on its own. From any project directory,

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey web

launches the single-user Web Terminal as one local process — no containers, no
proxy, ready in seconds at ``http://127.0.0.1:8087``. It is the fastest way to
try OSPREY and the right tool whenever one person sits in front of one machine;
:doc:`web-terminal/operate` covers it.

The multi-user stack is strictly opt-in. It lives in a
``modules.web_terminals`` block in the deployment's built ``config.yml``, read
only by the lifecycle verbs (and validated by
``osprey scaffold web-terminals lint``).
``osprey web`` never looks at it — so a project that carries the block (the
``control-assistant`` preset ships one) runs single-user exactly like one that
does not. Reach for the multi-user stack when several people need their own
terminal on a shared machine, and stay with ``osprey web`` for everything else.

How it works
============

.. mermaid::

   flowchart LR
       B[Browser] -->|:9080| N[nginx landing page]
       N -->|/u/alice/| A[alice's terminal container]
       N -->|/u/bob/| Bo[bob's terminal container]
       N -->|/u/ariel/| Ar[ARIEL logbook container]
       A --- S[(shared services:<br/>databases · telemetry)]
       Bo --- S
       Ar --- S

Three ideas carry the whole design:

**One container per user.** Every name on the roster gets its own Web Terminal
container, plus two named volumes that belong to the *user*, not the container:
a workspace volume (the files the agent reads and writes) and an
agent-configuration volume. Upgrading or rebuilding an image replaces the
container but never touches those volumes, so a user's files and settings
survive every redeploy. On first start, ``osprey up`` seeds each user's
configuration volume automatically — no per-user setup steps.

**A persona is a capability tier — and a whole project.** Users map to
*personas*, and each persona is its own rendered OSPREY project with its own
``config.yml``, permissions, skills, and tool servers. Because permissions are
a property of a project, the tiers are genuinely different agents — not one
agent with a UI toggle. The ``control-assistant`` preset ships two: a
*read-only* tier and a *read-write* tier — the same agent and tool surface,
differing on exactly one config key (``control_system.writes_enabled``).

It also ships a third persona that is not a tier of that agent at all.
``ariel`` is the standalone logbook research assistant: no control-system tool
servers, no Python sandbox, no plan queue — a different product, reached from
its own card. Nothing special makes that possible. A persona is already a
whole project, so it can differ in what it *is* as easily as in what it may
write. It shares this deployment's PostgreSQL and logbook, so the operators
and the research terminal read one logbook together.

``osprey build`` renders one persona project per delta in ``personas/``, and
``osprey up`` builds each one's container image locally, so no registry or CI is
involved.

**One front door.** An nginx reverse proxy serves the landing page and proxies
``/u/<name>/`` to that user's container. The per-user containers are pinned to
the loopback interface, so nginx is the only network path in. The landing page
lists the roster, and its cards are how someone picks an identity; whether
clicking a card *lets them in* depends on whether you have turned login on —
see :ref:`multi-user-require-a-login`.

The config block
================

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Switching it on

      The whole feature is one config block. This is what a project built from
      the ``control-assistant`` preset carries in its ``config.yml``:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         modules:
           web_terminals:
             enabled: true
             image_source: local       # osprey up builds persona images itself
             nginx_port: 9080          # the landing page
             web_base_port: 9091       # per-user ports: base + user index
             artifact_base_port: 9291
             ariel_base_port: 9391
             lattice_base_port: 9491
             channel_finder_base_port: 9591
             default_persona: readonly
             landing:
               groups:
               - type: users
                 label: Users
             users:
             - name: alice
               index: 0
               persona: readwrite
               display_name: "Control Room (Alice)"
             - name: bob
               index: 1
               persona: readonly
               display_name: "Read-Only View (Bob)"
             - name: ariel
               index: 2
               persona: ariel
               display_name: "ARIEL Logbook Research"
             personas:
               readonly:
                 project: control-assistant-readonly
                 project_path: build/control-assistant-readonly
                 build_profile: personas/readonly.yml
               readwrite:
                 project: control-assistant-readwrite
                 project_path: build/control-assistant-readwrite
                 build_profile: personas/readwrite.yml
               ariel:
                 project: control-assistant-ariel
                 project_path: build/control-assistant-ariel
                 build_profile: personas/ariel.yml
                 landing_group: Standalone deployments

      Each ``build_profile`` names that persona's **delta** in the deployment
      repository — the file ``osprey init`` writes under ``personas/`` and
      points the catalog at. The delta merges over ``profile.yml``, so every
      persona shares one data
      tree, one set of secrets, and one set of your own artifacts. A bundled
      preset name, an absolute path, or a path outside ``personas/`` is
      rejected by both ``osprey scaffold web-terminals lint`` and
      ``osprey up``.

      The ``users`` list is the roster — the single source of truth for who
      exists. A bare name (``- carol``) resolves to ``default_persona`` —
      read-only, so a hastily added user lands on the safe side; an entry with
      an explicit ``persona`` picks its tier, and an optional ``display_name``
      becomes that user's browser tab title. Each user's host ports are
      ``base + index`` in every port family — one family per companion panel
      (artifact gallery, ARIEL, channel finder, lattice dashboard, …) plus the
      terminal itself — so alice (index 0) serves her terminal on ``9091``,
      bob (index 1) on ``9092``, and ariel (index 2) on ``9093``. A panel
      whose ``*_base_port`` you don't set falls back to its built-in default,
      so the block above lists them only to make the layout visible.

      A persona may also name a landing-page section with ``landing_group``.
      Its users are lifted out of the roster's default section into one of
      that name, drawn as a panel — which is how the page shows a standalone
      service as something other than another login. The ``users`` group takes
      a ``label`` for the same reason: so both halves can be named. Neither
      changes anything about a container.

      .. tip::

         Give every roster entry an explicit ``index`` before you ever
         *remove* one. Once indices are pinned, deleting an earlier user can
         no longer shift a later user's ports out from under a running
         deployment.

   .. tab-item:: Day-to-day operations

      The roster drives everything: edit it, then let the lifecycle verbs
      reconcile reality against it.

      Edit it in the **source profile** — the ``modules.web_terminals.users``
      entry under ``config:`` in ``profile.yml`` — and rebuild. A roster change
      made directly in the built ``build/config.yml`` deploys, but the next
      build overwrites it. Rebuilding also seeds an empty
      ``web-terminal-context/<user>/`` slot for each new operator, which is
      where their per-user context goes.

      Beside those slots sits ``web-terminal-context/base.md`` — the shared
      baseline every seeded user's ``CLAUDE.md`` starts from. ``osprey init``
      materializes it from the preset so the text is visible and editable in
      your repo; edit it there and rebuild, and every terminal picks up the
      change. A profile without one falls back to a generic framework
      baseline.

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 34 66

         * - Task
           - Command
         * - **Add a user**
           - Add a roster entry with the next free ``index``, then
             ``osprey up``. The new container comes up with freshly
             allocated ports and a seeded workspace; existing users are
             untouched.
         * - **Reseed workspaces**
           - ``osprey users seed [USER]`` re-applies the seeded configuration
             for one user, or for everyone when ``USER`` is omitted.
         * - **Remove one user**
           - ``osprey users remove USER`` stops and removes the user's
             container. Their volumes are **retained** by default; add
             ``--archive`` to tarball them into ``web_terminal_archives/``
             first, or ``--purge`` to delete them outright.
         * - **Clean up leftovers**
           - ``osprey users prune`` removes workspaces of users no longer on
             the roster. ``--dry-run`` shows what it would do first, and the
             same ``--archive`` / ``--purge`` policy applies.
         * - **Tear it all down**
           - ``osprey reset`` wipes the whole deployment back to a fresh state —
             containers, volumes, and images, every user's workspace included —
             after a typed confirmation. It prints the removal plan first;
             ``--dry-run`` stops there.

      ``osprey status`` and ``osprey down`` work exactly as they
      do for any other OSPREY service stack.

Run the multi-user stack
========================

From a fresh checkout, create a deployment repository from the bundled preset,
then build and bring the stack up from inside it:

.. code-block:: bash

   # 1. Create the deployment repo from the control-assistant preset
   osprey init control-assistant --preset control-assistant

   # 2. From inside the repo, render it and bring the whole stack up
   cd control-assistant
   osprey build
   osprey up

That is the entire setup: the preset ships the ``modules.web_terminals`` block
above, so no extra flags or configuration are needed. Alongside the web tier,
``osprey up`` brings up everything else the control-assistant tutorial deploys
— the virtual accelerator, the bluesky services, and the supporting
PostgreSQL/OpenObserve containers — so the control-room terminals open onto a
working machine, and the ARIEL terminal onto a live logbook, not an empty
shell.

.. note::

   The personas' agent needs your provider credentials at run time. Add them
   to the repository's ``.env`` before ``osprey up`` (the preset defaults
   to Anthropic — set ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``). If you chose a different provider
   (``osprey set provider=...``), that choice is recorded in ``profile.yml`` and
   carried into every persona project the build renders.

.. note::

   Running from a **source checkout** of the OSPREY repository rather than a
   released install? Add ``--dev`` to ``osprey up``. The images install
   the framework from PyPI by default, and a source tree's version isn't
   published there; ``--dev`` bakes your local checkout into the images
   instead.

What ``osprey build`` and ``osprey up`` do for the web tier
-----------------------------------------------------------

#. **The build renders the persona projects.** ``osprey build`` renders one
   project per **delta** in ``personas/``, into the build zone beside the main
   render (``build/control-assistant-readonly``,
   ``build/control-assistant-readwrite`` and ``build/control-assistant-ariel``).
   Because each delta merges over
   ``profile.yml``, every persona shares its data tree, secrets and artifacts,
   and inherits the choices recorded there (provider, model): edit the profile
   once and every terminal picks the change up from the file rather than from a
   replayed command line. A start renders none of this — ``build/`` is the
   whole account of what will run — so a persona project missing at start time
   is reported as a stale or partial build, with a rebuild as the remedy.

#. **The start builds each persona's image.** In the preset's local mode
   (``image_source: local``), ``osprey up`` builds each persona's image
   (tagged ``<project>-<persona>:local``) from that rendered project —
   no registry, no CI.

#. **Brings up the web tier.** An nginx reverse proxy (container ``ca-nginx``)
   serves the landing page on ``http://127.0.0.1:9080``, and one Web Terminal
   container comes up per user — ``ca-web-alice`` on host port ``9091``,
   ``ca-web-bob`` on ``9092`` and ``ca-web-ariel`` on ``9093`` — each reached
   through the landing page. (The
   ``ca-`` prefix is the preset's ``facility.prefix``; change it for your
   site.)

Stop the stack again with ``osprey down``; check on it with
``osprey status``.

.. note::

   The web stack runs with host networking. On Linux,
   ``http://127.0.0.1:9080`` is reachable as-is. On **macOS**, a container's
   "host" is Docker Desktop's Linux VM — enable *host networking* in Docker
   Desktop (Settings → Resources → Network) so the stack's ports reach your
   browser.

   If another OSPREY deployment already occupies a service port on this host,
   change it in the profile and rebuild — for example
   ``osprey set config.services.postgresql.port_host=5433 && osprey build`` —
   before ``osprey up``.

The landing page
----------------

Open ``http://127.0.0.1:9080``. The landing page groups the users into cards,
each labelled with the persona it resolves to:

.. figure:: /_static/resources/multi_user_landing.png
   :alt: The multi-user landing page — alice's and bob's cards under a Users
         heading, and the ARIEL terminal in a Standalone deployments panel
         beneath them
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

   The grouped landing page: alice resolves to the readwrite persona, bob to
   readonly, and the ariel card opens the standalone logbook terminal. Click
   a card to open that session.

The two operator cards name their persona explicitly — alice the readwrite
tier, bob the readonly one. (A bare roster entry would fall back to the
preset's ``default_persona``, readonly, so an implicit user always lands on
the safe side.) The ariel card sits apart, in the accent-edged panel its
persona's ``landing_group`` names — and carries no persona badge, because the
badge answers *which tier is this user on?* and here the card and its persona
are the same word. Clicking any card opens that session at ``/u/<name>/``,
proxied by nginx to its own container.

Two sessions, two write postures
--------------------------------

Each persona is a self-contained OSPREY project with its **own** permissions,
because permissions are a property of a project's ``config.yml`` — the two
tiers are genuinely different agents, not one agent with a UI toggle. The
enforcement boundary is exactly **one** config key, the reference monitor's
master write switch; the tiers additionally differ in presentation — the
write-armed terminal gets the full expert workspace with the EVENTS and
BLUESKY control panels, the read-only one a chat-first simple surface without
them:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 14 30 56

   * - User
     - ``control_system.writes_enabled``
     - What that means in the session
   * - **alice**
     - ``true``
     - Write-capable — and supervised, not unguarded. A channel write still
       passes the writes-check hook, per-channel min/max limits, and a human
       approval prompt before the connector executes it.
   * - **bob**
     - ``false``
     - Read-only. Channel reads, the channel finder, the archiver, and logbook
       search all work — but every write surface refuses: channel writes,
       read-write Python execution, all of it, from the single switch.

This compares the two control-system tiers. The standalone ariel terminal is
outside the comparison: it has no control system behind it at all, so there is
no write posture to contrast.

The posture is a property of the **session**, not a statement about the
person: which teammates get a write-capable tier is your roster's call, and
the point is that the framework provisions genuinely different postures from
one deployment.

The boundary is enforced, not asserted — so you can watch it act. Open each
user's terminal and ask both agents to do the same two things:

**Read.** Ask either agent about a channel — a corrector setpoint, a BPM
reading. Both sessions answer identically: reads are ungated on both tiers.

**Write.** Ask each agent to change a setpoint. In alice's session the write
goes to a human approval prompt, then executes. In bob's session the same
request is **refused**: the write tool is denied in his project's rendered
permissions, and the refusal states plainly that writes are disabled in his
configuration.

Both agents carry the *same* tool surface — the readonly tier is not a
stripped-down agent that never heard of writing. It is the same agent whose
write path is switched off in its own project, which is exactly what you want
to demonstrate to a control room: the boundary holds at the enforcement layer,
not at the menu. (The readonly terminal's leaner look — no EVENTS/BLUESKY
tabs, chat-first layout — is presentation for the viewer tier, not the
boundary itself: the refusal above fires with or without it.)

Logging out and switching users
-------------------------------

Every session's header carries a chip naming the signed-in user; clicking it
opens a small menu with **Log out**. That POSTs to the terminal's logout
route, clears the local session pointer, and returns you to the landing page.
From there, pick another card to open a different user. Logging out ends the
session for real — the terminal drops its running processes, so the next login
starts **fresh**. Simply navigating away (without logout) keeps the session
warm, and returning to the same user reconnects to it.

.. _multi-user-require-a-login:

Require a login
===============

With no ``auth`` stanza the stack asks for no credentials and speaks plain
HTTP: clicking a card on the landing page opens that terminal, and anyone who
can reach the nginx port can click any card. That posture suits a **single
trusted host** — a workstation or control-room machine you already trust — and
nothing beyond it.

The ``control-assistant`` preset ships with password login switched on, in its
demo posture: each roster user's password is seeded into the repository's
``.env`` by ``osprey init`` (``alice``/``alice``, ``bob``/``bob`` — change them
there, or rotate with ``osprey users passwd``), the ARIEL entry stays public
via ``login: false`` (see below), and ``allow_insecure_http: true`` keeps the
demo on plain HTTP. Those passwords authenticate a demo, not a facility: for
any reachable host, set real passwords and serve TLS as described here.

Set ``auth.method`` and every request under ``/u/<name>/`` — pages, APIs and
the terminal's live connection alike — is refused unless the browser holds a
valid session for *that* user. The check happens at the front door: a small
authentication service joins the stack in its own container, and nginx asks it
about each request before proxying anything. Nothing depends on the per-user
containers policing themselves.

Note that the persona split is a *capability* boundary, enforced per project —
it decides what a session may do, never who may open it. Those are separate
questions, and login answers only the second.

Choose a method
---------------

**Passwords**, managed by OSPREY. Nothing extra to run or operate:

.. code-block:: yaml

   modules:
     web_terminals:
       tls:
         enabled: true
         host_cert_dir: /etc/ssl/facility     # host side; mounted for you
         cert: /etc/osprey/tls/facility.crt   # container side
         key: /etc/osprey/tls/facility.key
       auth:
         method: password

**OIDC**, against the single sign-on your facility already runs. Each roster
entry names the identity that maps to it, so a valid login as somebody else
cannot open this user's terminal:

.. code-block:: yaml

   modules:
     web_terminals:
       tls:
         enabled: true
         host_cert_dir: /etc/ssl/facility     # host side; mounted for you
         cert: /etc/osprey/tls/facility.crt   # container side
         key: /etc/osprey/tls/facility.key
       auth:
         method: oidc
         oidc:
           issuer: https://sso.example.org/realms/accelerator
           client_id_env: OSPREY_AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID
           client_secret_env: OSPREY_AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET
           claim: sub                       # ID-token claim to match on
       users:
         - name: alice
           index: 0
           oidc_subject: "8f4c1e02-..."     # alice's value of that claim
         - name: bob
           index: 1
           oidc_subject: "b7d9a340-..."

The ``*_env`` keys hold environment-variable **names**, not credentials: put the
client id and secret in the project's ``.env.auth`` under those names — that is
the only file the authentication service reads credentials from. The names
shown are the ones OSPREY reads when you omit the keys, and ``claim`` falls back
to ``sub`` in the authentication service itself. ``oidc_subject`` is not a
secret — it is the identifier your provider already publishes for that person.

.. warning::

   **No secret may contain a dollar sign** — not in ``.env.auth``, and not in
   the ``.env`` and ``.env.users`` that carry your provider API key and
   facility passwords. Depending on which container stack reads these files,
   ``$`` sequences inside the *values* are substituted on the way through —
   with Docker Compose, ``secret$abc`` arrives as ``secret`` and ``P@$$w0rd``
   arrives as ``P@$w0rd``; other stacks mangle a different set. Either way the
   file on disk still reads correctly, so the only symptom is a login or a
   token exchange that refuses for no visible reason.

   This bites hardest with a client secret your identity provider generated for
   you, since you did not choose those characters. If yours contains a ``$``,
   issue a new one rather than trying to escape it — escaping is not portable
   between container runtimes, so there is no spelling that works everywhere.

   ``osprey up`` refuses to start a stack whose secrets would be corrupted
   this way and names the offending variables, so you find out before the
   deployment is running rather than after someone cannot log in.

   The same rule extends to each user's ``oidc_subject``, which travels a
   different route (the rendered compose file rather than an env file) but is
   rewritten the same way: lint refuses a subject containing ``$`` and names
   the user. If your provider genuinely issues one, map a different claim via
   ``auth.oidc.claim``.

Three more keys are optional. ``auth.port`` is the port the authentication
service listens on (default ``9070``); ``auth.session_lifetime`` is how long a
session stays valid, in **whole seconds** (default ``43200``, twelve hours); and
``auth.image`` names the service's image, which is **required** when
``image_source: registry`` — your CI publishes that image the same way it
publishes the terminal images. In ``image_source: local`` mode
``osprey up`` builds it for you and ``auth.image`` is not needed.

.. warning::

   ``auth.port`` and ``auth.session_lifetime`` must be plain positive integers.
   A duration string like ``"12h"``, a decimal, zero or a negative number is
   **silently replaced by the default** — nothing warns you — so a deployment
   that meant eight-hour sessions would quietly keep twelve-hour ones.

The service listens on ``127.0.0.1`` on the deploy host itself (the web stack
uses host networking), so nginx reaches it and nothing off-host does. It is not
published as a container port, and anyone with a shell on the deploy host can
reach it — the same as every per-user terminal.

Leave one entry public
----------------------

Not every card on the landing page is a person's terminal. A roster entry that
fronts a read-only service — the preset's ARIEL logbook assistant, say — can
opt out of the login wall:

.. code-block:: yaml

   users:
     - name: ariel
       index: 2
       persona: ariel
       login: false

With authentication on, that entry is served exactly as the whole deployment is
with authentication off: no login, no session, open to anyone who can reach the
nginx port. No password is provisioned for it (``osprey users passwd`` refuses
the name and says why), and nginx never asks the authentication service about
it. Session cookies still never reach its container.

Only the literal ``false`` opts an entry out. Absence, ``true``, and any typo
all mean "login required" — a misspelling can lock an entry down, never open it
up — and lint reports a non-boolean value. The key is inert while
``auth.method`` is ``none``, which lint points out as well.

Opting out is for entries whose *content* is public by design. Anything that
can reach a control system, write anywhere, or spend provider tokens belongs
behind the wall.

Serve it over HTTPS
-------------------

A session cookie sent over plain HTTP is readable by anything on the path, so a
deployment with ``auth.method`` other than ``none`` and ``tls.enabled: false``
**refuses to render at all** rather than hand out cookies in the clear. You
therefore have to pick one of two ways to get the connection encrypted.

**Let this nginx terminate TLS.** Set ``tls.enabled: true`` with a certificate
and key, and nginx serves HTTPS on 443, redirects the plain port to it, and
marks session cookies so browsers only ever send them over HTTPS. Bringing the
certificate is still your job, but getting it *into* the container is not:

.. code-block:: yaml

   tls:
     enabled: true
     host_cert_dir: /etc/ssl/facility          # on the deploy host
     cert: /etc/osprey/tls/facility.crt        # inside the container
     key: /etc/osprey/tls/facility.key

``host_cert_dir`` is the only key here that names a path on the **deploy host**;
``cert`` and ``key`` are paths **inside the nginx container**. Setting
``host_cert_dir`` bind-mounts that directory, read-only, at the directory
``cert`` sits in — so the certificate is where nginx looks without you writing
any compose of your own. Renewals need nothing extra: the mount is a directory,
so a replaced file is picked up on the next nginx reload.

Because one mount has to deliver both files, ``cert`` and ``key`` must sit in
the same directory, and ``host_cert_dir`` must be absolute. A deployment that
breaks either rule is refused at render time, naming the reason — rather than
starting an nginx that immediately dies looking for a file nobody mounted.

.. note::

   ``host_cert_dir`` is optional. Leave it out and nothing is mounted: the
   compose overlay renders exactly as it does without TLS, and supplying the
   certificate is yours to arrange — a bind mount from a small compose file of
   your own, listed after the web overlay in ``runtime.compose_files``, or
   whatever your facility's certificate management already does. That is the
   route to take when a plain directory bind cannot express how certificates
   reach this host.

**Or terminate TLS in front of this nginx.** If a facility load balancer or
ingress proxy already presents the certificate and forwards to this host, set
``auth.allow_insecure_http: true`` and leave ``tls.enabled`` off. This is a
normal deployment, not a workaround: the browser's connection is encrypted by
the thing in front, and the hop it forwards over is yours to keep private.

What ``allow_insecure_http`` is *not* is a way to postpone certificates on a
reachable host. With it set and nothing terminating TLS, anyone who can watch
the traffic can copy a session cookie and become that user. An isolated network
where you accept that risk is the only other case for it.

Passwords, and where they live
------------------------------

In password mode ``osprey up`` makes sure every user on the roster has a
password hash before it starts anything, and aborts before a single container
starts if it cannot — an unwritable file is caught here rather than becoming a
stack nobody can log in to. The same check covers the keys used to sign session
cookies, so an OIDC deployment can abort the same way even though it provisions
no passwords at all. The usual cause either way is permissions on ``.env.auth``
or on the project directory.

The hashes and signing keys live in ``.env.auth`` in the project root — mode
``0600``, listed in the generated ``.gitignore`` next to ``.env.users``,
and handed to the authentication service alone. No terminal container ever sees
it.

For each user, in order:

#. An existing hash in ``.env.auth`` is kept. Deploying again never resets
   anyone's password.
#. Otherwise, a plaintext ``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_<USER>`` in the project's ``.env`` is
   hashed into ``.env.auth`` — the way to set a password you already chose. The
   plaintext stays on the deploy host; only the hash reaches a container.
#. Otherwise a password is generated, hashed, and **printed once**, on that
   deploy's output. Nothing can recover it afterwards, so capture it and hand it
   to the person.

``<USER>`` is the username uppercased with ``-`` turned into ``_``. Because that
mapping is what keeps one user's password out of another user's terminal, an
authenticated deployment refuses to render when two roster names collide under
it (``alice-b`` and ``alice_b``), or when a name falls outside
``[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*``.

To change a password later:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey users passwd alice

It prompts (never echoing), rewrites that one hash, and restarts the
authentication service. Alice's existing sessions stop working immediately, and
nobody else's are touched.

Sessions, logging out, and rolling back
---------------------------------------

The landing page stays public — it lists the roster so people can find their own
card, and a card is a prompt, not a door. One browser may hold several unlocked
users at once, which is what a shared control-room machine needs; logging out
ends that one user's session and leaves the others alone.

.. note::

   The list of logged-out sessions is held in the authentication service's
   memory, so restarting that container forgets it. A cookie captured before a
   logout could be replayed until it expires on its own — within
   ``auth.session_lifetime``.

Removing someone needs care, because a credential can outlive the person's
account in three different ways:

**Use** ``osprey users remove alice`` **, not a hand-edit.** Deleting a
roster entry and running ``osprey up`` removes alice's container, and the
authentication service stops answering for a name that is no longer on the
roster — but her hash stays in ``.env.auth``. Add the name back months later and
her old password works again. ``decommission`` (or ``prune``, for names already
edited out) is what actually retires the credential.

**A plaintext password in** ``.env`` **survives decommission.** If you seeded
alice's password by putting ``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_ALICE`` in the project's ``.env``,
decommissioning her clears the hash but leaves that line — and the next
``osprey up`` for a new alice hashes it straight back in, handing the new
person the departed one's password. The decommission warns you, but the warning
scrolls past in a deploy log weeks before anyone reuses the name. **Delete the**
``.env`` **line by hand when the person leaves.**

**In OIDC mode,** ``decommission`` **is the verb that ends a session.**
``prune`` cleans up users already off the roster, but it only restarts the
authentication service when it actually removed a password entry — and an OIDC
user has none. Their container is gone either way, so the stale route just
fails; but if what you need is that person's *session* closed now, run
``decommission``.

To turn login back off, set ``auth.method: none`` and run ``osprey up``.
That re-renders nginx and the compose file, drops the authentication service,
and returns the stack to the open posture described at the top of this section.
``.env.auth`` is left in place, so turning login on again keeps everyone's
existing password.
