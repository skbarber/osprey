How-To Guides
=============

Task-oriented guides that walk you through common OSPREY operations step by step.
Each guide focuses on a single goal and assumes you already have a working OSPREY installation.
The sections follow the natural journey: build and deploy a project, run and
operate the agent, extend it for your facility, then explore the bundled
services and tutorials.

Build & Deploy a Project

   .. grid-item-card:: Build Profiles
      :link: build-profiles
      :link-type: doc

      :link: deploy-a-facility
      :link-type: doc

   .. grid-item-card:: Configure LLM Providers
      :link: configure-providers
      :link-type: doc

   .. grid-item-card:: Run Open & Local Models
      :link: run-open-models
      :link-type: doc

      Drive the Osprey agent with open-weight or self-hosted models via the
      translation proxy, and benchmark their capability with ``scripts/benchmark/``.

   .. grid-item-card:: Deploy a Project
      :link: deploy-project
      :link-type: doc

      Create, configure, and deploy an OSPREY project from ``osprey build`` through
      ``osprey up`` to a running instance.

   .. grid-item-card:: Containerize a Project
      :link: containerize-project
      :link-type: doc

      Build and run the container image generated for every project — build args,
      path relocation, air-gapped mode, and Kubernetes notes.

Run & Operate the Agent
-----------------------

.. grid:: 1 1 2 3
   :gutter: 3

   .. grid-item-card:: Web Terminal
      :link: web-terminal/index
      :link-type: doc

      The browser cockpit for the Osprey agent — launching it, theming every
      OSPREY interface at once, and adding your own themed side panels.

   .. grid-item-card:: Multi-User Support
      :link: multi-user
      :link-type: doc

      Serve a whole team from one host — a landing page plus a private
      containerized Web Terminal per user, in read-only and write-capable
      capability tiers.

   .. grid-item-card:: Use the CLI Chat Interface
      :link: use-cli-chat
      :link-type: doc

      Run the Osprey agent in your native terminal with companion services accessible
      in a browser.

   .. grid-item-card:: Non-Interactive Agent Queries
      :link: non_interactive_query
      :link-type: doc

      Run the OSPREY agent headlessly from CI pipelines and automated workflows
      with ``osprey query`` — read-only, structured JSON output, and clear exit codes.

   .. grid-item-card:: Event Dispatch
      :link: event-dispatch
      :link-type: doc

      Turn external events — webhooks and cron ticks — into headless Osprey agent
      runs, deployed as containers or run locally.

   .. grid-item-card:: Chat Bridges
      :link: chat-bridges/index
      :link-type: doc

      Let your team ask the Osprey agent questions from Nextcloud Talk or Google
      Chat and get answers, plots, and files back in the same conversation.

   .. grid-item-card:: Monitor the Agent
      :link: monitor-agent
      :link-type: doc

      Emit the agent's logs and metrics over OTLP to any backend, or deploy the
      opt-in local OpenObserve store alongside your project.

   .. grid-item-card:: Configure Health Checks
      :link: configure-health-checks
      :link-type: doc

      Extend ``osprey health`` with facility probe checks and plugins, and tune
      the suite's cost classes and timeouts via the ``health:`` config block.

Extend & Integrate
------------------

.. grid:: 1 1 2 3
   :gutter: 3

   .. grid-item-card:: Add a Control System Connector
      :link: add-connector
      :link-type: doc

      Create a custom connector to integrate a new control system protocol (beyond EPICS
      and Mock) with OSPREY's protocol-agnostic architecture.

   .. grid-item-card:: Add an MCP Server
      :link: add-mcp-server
      :link-type: doc

      Build and register a new FastMCP server to expose domain-specific tools that
      the Osprey agent can discover and call.

   .. grid-item-card:: Use the Python Executor
      :link: use-python-executor
      :link-type: doc

      Run agent-generated Python scripts safely in a containerized environment with
      access to the OSPREY runtime API.

   .. grid-item-card:: Facility Knowledge
      :link: use-facility-knowledge
      :link-type: doc

      What the Open Knowledge Format is and why OSPREY stores facility knowledge
      as cross-linked markdown, plus how to structure, author, and serve a
      bundle to the agent on demand.

Bundled Services & Tutorials
