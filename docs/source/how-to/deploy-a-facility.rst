Deploy a Facility
=================

This page builds one facility deployment from an empty directory to running
containers, using only ``osprey`` commands. Follow it in order and you end up
with a git repository you can commit, review, and hand to a colleague.

The facility is called **Demo Facility**. It runs three services, serves two web
terminals — one read-only, one write-capable — and ships one container the
facility writes itself.

.. dropdown:: What You'll Learn
   :color: primary
   :icon: book

   - Creating a deployment repository with ``osprey init``
   - Editing the profile down to the services your facility actually runs
   - Adding a container the facility owns, with its own image-build job
   - Emitting the CI pipeline and the health check with ``osprey scaffold ci``
   - Rendering the build and bringing the stack up
   - Making the deployment come back by itself after a reboot

   **Prerequisites:** A working OSPREY installation, ``git``, and Docker or
   Podman running locally.

   **Time:** 30--45 minutes.

.. tip::

   Read :doc:`build-profiles` first if the words *preset*, *profile* and
   *build* are new. This page assumes you know that the profile is the source
   of truth and ``build/`` is a rendered artifact.


What you are building
=====================

One repository, holding the facility's editable source and the deployment
scaffolding that goes with it:

.. code-block:: text

Three services run:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 18 56

   * - Service
     - Comes from
     - What it does
   * - ``openobserve``
     - packaged
     - Telemetry store for the agent's logs and metrics.
   * - ``virtual_accelerator``
     - packaged
     - A containerized simulator with LUME-backed physics
       (:doc:`/architecture/virtual-accelerator`), serving EPICS Channel Access
       on port 5064 and standing in for the real machine.
   * - ``facility-mcp``
     - this profile
     - The facility's own MCP server on port 10900, built from a Dockerfile that
       lives in the profile.

The first two are packaged with OSPREY and come from their own upstreams. The
third is the interesting one: it is the part no framework can ship for you, and
everything about how a facility-owned container is declared, built, and reached
is in :ref:`deploy-a-facility-own-service`.


Step 1 — Create the facility repository
=======================================

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey init demo-facility --preset control-assistant
   cd demo-facility

The command writes the whole repository, runs ``git init`` at its root, and
commits nothing. It prints the handful of entries you edit: the profile, the
data directory, the three personas it rendered, the two env files, and the
README.

It says nothing about CI, which is expected: the profile ships with its
``deploy:`` block commented out, so there are no coordinates to render a
pipeline from. Step 5 fills the block in and Step 7 renders the pipeline from
it.


Step 2 — Trim the profile to this facility's stack
==================================================

Open ``profile.yml``. The ``control-assistant`` preset ships a fuller
stack than Demo Facility runs, so the first edit is subtraction. Delete:

* the top-level ``bluesky:``, ``bluesky_web:`` and ``dispatch:`` blocks. Each
  of these is a trigger: leaving one in place adds its service to the
  deployment, whatever else you write below.
* from ``skills:`` — ``writing-bluesky-plans``, ``operating-bluesky-plans``
  and ``bluesky-plans``.
* from ``agents:`` — ``logbook-search`` and ``logbook-deep-research``. Both
  query a logbook database at runtime, and this facility does not deploy one.
* for the same reason, the ``ariel`` entries under ``modules.web_terminals``
  in ``config:`` — the roster entry (``- name: ariel``) and the ``ariel:``
  persona — plus the ``personas/ariel.yml`` delta they point at. That login is
  the standalone ARIEL logbook terminal, and it needs the logbook database
  this facility does not run.
* from ``web_panels:`` — ``ariel``, ``events`` and ``bluesky``.
* from ``config:`` — the ``claude_code.servers.bluesky.enabled`` line and every
  ``web.panels.events.*`` and ``web.panels.bluesky.*`` override. The panels they
  configure no longer exist.

Keep the ``virtual_accelerator:`` block. It is the trigger for the Virtual
Accelerator this facility drives.


Step 3 — Name the facility and pin its services
===============================================

Still in ``profile.yml``, under ``config:``, set these six values. Some
are already present with a different value; some ship commented out.

.. code-block:: yaml

   config:
     control_system.type: virtual_accelerator
     claude_code.servers.health.enabled: true
     system.timezone: America/Los_Angeles
     facility.name: Demo Facility
     facility.prefix: demo
     deployed_services:
       - openobserve

``control_system.type: virtual_accelerator`` points the agent at the deployed
simulator, so correctors move and BPMs read through exactly the approval and
limit layers a live machine would use. The preset ships ``mock``, which touches
nothing.

``deployed_services`` looks too short, and is not. The ``virtual_accelerator:``
block and the ``services:`` entry you add in Step 4 each append their own
service to this list at build time. Naming ``openobserve`` explicitly is what
keeps the packaged skeleton's ``postgresql`` *out* — declared is not deployed,
and this list is what ``osprey up`` reads.

``facility.prefix`` becomes the container-name prefix for the web tier
(``demo-nginx``, ``demo-web-alice``), so keep it short and distinct from the
project name.

While you are in the ``modules.web_terminals:`` block, note the ``auth:``
stanza the preset ships: the terminals ask for a login, with demo passwords
that ``osprey init`` seeded into this repository's ``.env``
(``alice``/``alice``, ``bob``/``bob``) and ``allow_insecure_http: true``
keeping the login flow on plain HTTP. That is a demo posture. For a facility
host, set real passwords in ``.env`` (or rotate with ``osprey users passwd``)
and serve TLS — :doc:`web-terminal/multi-user/login` walks through both, and through single
sign-on if your site runs one.

Then confirm the persona catalog, further down the same ``config:`` block
under ``modules.web_terminals:``. ``osprey init`` derived these names from the
repository name, so after Step 2's trim the block already reads:

.. code-block:: yaml

     personas:
       readonly:
         project: demo-facility-readonly
         project_path: build/demo-facility-readonly
         build_profile: personas/readonly.yml
       readwrite:
         project: demo-facility-readwrite
         project_path: build/demo-facility-readwrite
         build_profile: personas/readwrite.yml

Nothing to edit — the block is shown so you know what you are looking at, and
because its shape matters if you ever rename a persona or the repository:

.. important::

   Each persona's ``project`` must equal the basename of its ``project_path``.
   ``osprey build`` derives a persona render's name the same way, which is how
   it lands exactly where the web tier mounts it.


.. _deploy-a-facility-own-service:

Step 4 — Add the facility's own container
=========================================

Declare the service, and the MCP server it serves. Replace the ``services: {}``
line and the commented ``mcp_servers:`` example with:

.. code-block:: yaml

   services:
     facility-mcp:
       template: services/facility-mcp
       config:
         port: 10900

   mcp_servers:
     facility:
       port: 10900
       transport: http
       permissions:
         allow: [machine_status]

``template:`` is profile-relative, so the next thing to do is write that
directory. The port appears twice because it is the same fact told to two
parties: the container publishes it, and the agent dials it. ``10900`` is the
first port of the facility band, the hundred ports the framework publishes
nothing in so that a facility's own services can claim them without ever
colliding — see :ref:`reference-ports-facility`.

Now create ``services/facility-mcp/`` with four files.

``requirements.txt``:

.. code-block:: text

   mcp==1.9.4

``server.py`` — a read-only tool over streamable HTTP. Nothing here imports
OSPREY: the agent reaches this container by URL, so the framework never has to
be installed alongside it.

.. code-block:: python

   """Demo Facility's own MCP server: read-only machine-status lookups."""

   from __future__ import annotations

   import json
   import os
   from pathlib import Path

   from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

   STATUS_FILE = Path(os.environ.get("FACILITY_STATUS_FILE", "/data/machine-status.json"))

   mcp = FastMCP("demo-facility", host="0.0.0.0", port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", "10900")))


   @mcp.tool()
   def machine_status() -> str:
       """Report the control room's current machine state and operating mode."""
       if not STATUS_FILE.is_file():
           return f"No machine status available ({STATUS_FILE} is not present)."
       return json.dumps(json.loads(STATUS_FILE.read_text()), indent=2)


   if __name__ == "__main__":
       mcp.run(transport="streamable-http")

.. note::

   Keep a facility tool like this read-only. Anything that writes to the machine
   belongs behind the control-system connector, which is the single interface
   every write goes through.

``Dockerfile`` — a service directory that carries one earns its own image-build
job in the pipeline:

.. code-block:: dockerfile

   FROM python:3.11-slim

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY requirements.txt ./
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   COPY server.py ./

   # Unbuffered so container logs appear as the server writes them rather than
   # when the process exits.
   ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
   EXPOSE 10900

   CMD ["python", "server.py"]

``docker-compose.yml.j2`` — the same channel every packaged service uses: one
compose template per service directory, rendered by the build.

.. code-block:: jinja

   services:
     facility-mcp:
       image: ${OSPREY_FACILITY_MCP_IMAGE:-{{ (services['facility-mcp'] | default({})).image | default(osprey_labels.project_name ~ '-facility-mcp:local') }}}
       build:
         # With multiple `-f` compose files every relative path resolves against
         # the FIRST file's directory — the compose project dir, not this file's
         # own subdir — so the context is the service directory by name.
         context: ./facility-mcp
         dockerfile: Dockerfile
       # container_name is a HOST-GLOBAL identifier: namespace it per-project so
       # two OSPREY projects can run this service on one host.
       container_name: {{ osprey_labels.project_name }}-facility-mcp
       labels:
         osprey.project.name: "{{ osprey_labels.project_name }}"
         # Which deployment repo this container belongs to. A facility service
         # carries it for the same reason every packaged one does: the preflight
         # reads it to tell "a port of ours, already up" from "somebody else's
         # process on our port", and an unlabelled container can only be guessed
         # at from the compose project name.
         com.osprey.repo-id: "{{ osprey_labels.repo_id }}"
         osprey.project.root: "{{ osprey_labels.project_root }}"
         # Content hashes of the env chain and the rendered config this service
         # reads. They are what makes an edit to either file restart this
         # container; see the deploy-project compose-templates page.
         osprey.env.digest: "${OSPREY_ENV_DIGEST:-}"
         osprey.config.digest: "${OSPREY_CONFIG_DIGEST:-}"
       restart: unless-stopped
       ports:
         - "{{ deployment.bind_address | default('127.0.0.1') }}:{{ (services['facility-mcp'] | default({})).port | default(10900) }}:10900/tcp"
       environment:
         PORT: "10900"
         FACILITY_STATUS_FILE: /data/machine-status.json
         TZ: {{ system.timezone }}
       volumes:
         - facility_mcp_data:/data
       networks:
         - osprey-network
       healthcheck:
         test: ["CMD-SHELL", "python -c \"import socket,sys; s=socket.socket(); s.settimeout(3); sys.exit(0 if s.connect_ex(('localhost', 10900)) == 0 else 1)\""]
         interval: 10s
         timeout: 5s
         retries: 5
         start_period: 10s

   volumes:
     facility_mcp_data:

   networks:
     osprey-network:

The image reference follows the framework convention — environment variable,
then config key, then a local tag. A laptop deploy builds the image from the
sources beside the template; the deploy host selects the pipeline's pushed image
by setting ``OSPREY_FACILITY_MCP_IMAGE``. The last layer is this template's own
literal, so the stack-wide registry and tag axes do not reach it: to have a
facility-owned image follow them, write the default with the same shape they
produce. :doc:`deploy-project/index` covers the template variables, the image chain,
and those axes in full.


Step 5 — Fill in the deployment coordinates
===========================================

Two edits, and they belong together.

First, ``env:`` and the ``deploy:`` block. Replace the preset's ``env.required``
list, and uncomment and fill in the ``deploy:`` block near the bottom of the
file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   env:
     required:
       - DEMO_REGISTRY_TOKEN

   deploy:
     ci: gitlab
     registry:
       url: registry.example.org/accelerator/demo-facility
       token_env_var: DEMO_REGISTRY_TOKEN
     host:
       name: demo-deploy
       fqdn: demo-deploy.example.org
       user: osprey
       project_path: /opt/demo-facility
     image_source: local

Substitute your own registry and host. ``registry.url`` carries no scheme — it
appears verbatim inside an image name. ``host.name`` must be ssh-resolvable for
whoever presses the deploy button, and ``host.project_path`` is where this
repository is checked out on that server. Credentials are *named* here, never
written here.

``image_source: local`` says the deploy host builds the web-terminal images
itself from the rendered persona projects, rather than pulling them from a
registry.

.. important::

   In the same edit, delete the ``image_source: local`` line from the
   ``modules.web_terminals:`` block under ``config:``. The ``deploy:`` block is
   that fact's only home, and the build writes the value into the rendered
   config for you. Saying it in both places is refused by name — the two are
   free to disagree, and the disagreement decides whether the host builds images
   or pulls them.


Step 6 — Add the secrets
========================

The profile owns this deployment's secrets, so that is where they go.

Step 1 may already have written ``.env`` for you, seeded from a matching
key your shell exports — it says so in its output. If that file does not exist
yet, start from the documented list:

.. code-block:: bash

   cp .env.example .env

Either way, edit ``.env`` and set ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` (or the key for
whichever provider your profile names) and ``DEMO_REGISTRY_TOKEN``. The
repository's ``.gitignore`` keeps ``.env`` out of git.

Service credentials such as ``ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD`` stay blank. ``osprey up``
mints a strong value for each unset one on first deploy and writes it back into
``.env``, so a later rebuild comes up on the same credentials the running
volumes were initialized with.

``.env.example`` is written by ``osprey init``. After you change
``env.required``, update the example alongside it — it is the documented list
that whoever sets this up next will read.


Step 7 — Validate, then emit the deployment files
=================================================

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey validate

A valid profile reports its name and its deploy target — ``Deploy: gitlab CI →
osprey@demo-deploy``. If anything is wrong, every problem is reported at once
rather than one per run.

Now render the deployment files from the ``deploy:`` block:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey scaffold ci

Two files appear:

``.gitlab-ci.yml``
   The pipeline, at the repository root. Its header lists the CI/CD variables
   the pipeline reads, which you set in your GitLab project settings, masked and
   protected: ``DEMO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`` (the registry credential named by your
   ``deploy:`` block) and ``OSPREY_DEPLOY_SSH_KEY``, a *File*-type variable
   holding the private key for the deploy-host account. The SSH key is CI-only —
   it authenticates the deploy job and is never part of the deployment's own
   environment, which is why it is not in ``env.required``.

``scripts/verify.sh``
   The post-deploy health check, at the repository root.

Re-run ``osprey scaffold ci`` whenever the ``deploy:`` block changes. It is
safe to re-run: a file whose content already matches is left untouched, and a
file the scaffolder did not write is reported and left alone unless you pass
``--force``.

``ci-extra.yml``, which ``osprey init`` created in Step 1, is the
facility's own include point. The pipeline includes it after everything the
scaffolder emits, so a job you add there can also override a scaffolded job by
redefining it under the same name. Nothing ever regenerates that file.


Step 8 — Build the project
==========================

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey build

``osprey build`` walks up to the repository's ``profile.yml`` and renders
``build/`` from it, from whichever directory inside the repository you run it.
Watch for these lines in the output:

* ``Injected 1 profile service(s) for deploy`` — ``facility-mcp`` was picked up.
* ``Injected Virtual Accelerator soft-IOC (CA port 5064)``.
* ``Persisted 1 MCP server(s) to config.yml`` — the agent can reach
  ``facility-mcp``.

Confirm the service list is exactly the three you expect:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey config --rendered | grep -A3 '^deployed_services:'

It should read ``openobserve``, ``facility-mcp``, ``virtual_accelerator``.


Step 9 — Deploy and check
=========================

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey up -d

.. note::

   Running OSPREY from a **source checkout** rather than a released install?
   Add ``--dev`` — ``osprey up`` otherwise refuses, because a container built
   from PyPI would run different code than your checkout, and ``--dev`` builds
   the image from the checkout instead; see :doc:`deploy-project/index` for that
   workflow.

The first run is slow: the virtual accelerator and the facility's own image are
both built locally. When the containers are up, ``osprey up`` runs
``scripts/verify.sh`` itself and prints a summary of the published endpoints.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey status

Read the lines *above* the status table first. A drift report there means
``build/`` was rendered from an older profile than the one on disk now, and the
fix is ``osprey build``, not a restart.

You can run the health check by hand at any time, and it is worth doing once
before you trust it:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./scripts/verify.sh              # every probe
   ./scripts/verify.sh services     # one group

It always exits 0 — the output is the report, and the exit code says nothing.
Probes are advisory: a failed probe tells you where to look, and must never be
the reason a deploy is called a failure.


What the pipeline does
======================

The walkthrough above is the local path. The pipeline in ``.gitlab-ci.yml``
takes the same profile through three stages:

**validate** runs on every commit and needs no credentials. It runs
``osprey validate``, then ``osprey build`` with ``--skip-lifecycle
--skip-deps`` — CI has no container runtime for post-build hooks, and nothing
there runs the agent, so its virtual environment would be dead weight. The
render is published as an artifact so a reviewer can see exactly what the
commit produces.

**images** builds one image per facility-owned service that carries a
Dockerfile — here, just ``facility-mcp``. The build context is the service
directory in the *source zone*, not the rendered copy. Every build pushes a
commit-SHA tag; only the default branch moves ``:latest``, so a feature branch
can never reach the deploy host by accident.

**deploy** is manual and default-branch only, serialized by a resource group so
two operators cannot interleave on the host. It re-renders on the host from the
same commit rather than unpacking the artifact, which is what makes the running
stack reproducible from git alone:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey build
   osprey users env --output .env.users
   osprey up -d

``osprey users env`` writes the env file every per-user web-terminal
container runs with, from the deploy host's own env chain — ``.env.shared``
then ``.env``, with ``.env`` winning on any key both set. Passing
``--output`` is not optional: without it the command writes the assembled
secrets to stdout, which in a pipeline is the job log. ``--output`` also creates
the file at mode ``0600`` from its first byte, which a shell redirect would not.


Changing something later
========================

The loop is always the same: edit the profile, rebuild, redeploy. Run it
anywhere inside the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey set connector=epics          # or edit profile.yml by hand
   osprey set config.archiver.type=epics_archiver
   osprey set va_archiver=null         # the recorded archive goes with the stand-in
   osprey build
   osprey up -d

Or in one step, ``osprey up --build -d``. Every build re-renders everything the
framework owns and preserves what you own: ``.env``, ``var/``, and the
repository's git history. The source zone itself is never touched by a build.

If you changed the ``deploy:`` block, run ``osprey scaffold ci`` again first
so the pipeline and health check match the new coordinates.


Operating it
============

Everything past "the stack is up" runs from anywhere inside the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey status                  # what is running, where it answers
   osprey logs event_dispatcher   # one service's output; -f to follow
   osprey health                  # config, environment, providers, telemetry
   osprey restart                 # stop and start again
   osprey down                    # stop it, keeping the volumes

``osprey status`` reads and reports — it starts nothing and renders nothing —
so it is safe against a live stack and is the right first command when
something looks wrong. It also says whether ``build/`` still matches
``profile.yml``, which is the same check ``osprey up`` refuses on.

When the answer is not obvious from those, run them inside an OSPREY agent
session in the repository: the agent reads the same output you do, and it has
the deployment's configuration and rendered files at hand.


Starting it again after a reboot
================================

Nothing so far survives the host restarting: the containers come back only when
somebody runs ``osprey up -d`` again. ``osprey scaffold systemd`` writes a
systemd user unit that does it for you.

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey scaffold systemd

It writes ``osprey.service`` at the repository root — and, beside it,
``scripts/osprey-boot-hook.sh``, covered below — and prints the commands that
install the unit on this machine:

.. code-block:: bash

   cp /path/to/repo/osprey.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
   systemctl --user daemon-reload
   systemctl --user enable --now osprey.service

Run the scaffold verb **on the machine that will run the deployment**. Both the
repository directory and the ``osprey`` program are written into the unit as
full paths, because systemd starts a unit with no working directory and a short
``PATH`` — a unit generated on your laptop would name paths the host does not
have. Run it again after the repository moves or OSPREY is reinstalled
somewhere else. Re-running is otherwise safe: a unit whose content already
matches is left untouched, stamp included, so an OSPREY upgrade alone produces
no diff, and a file the scaffolder did not write is reported and left alone
unless you pass ``--force``.

If no ``osprey`` program can be found to name, the command refuses rather than
writing a unit that points at nothing. Check that ``command -v osprey`` answers
in the same shell — if OSPREY lives in a virtual environment, activate it and
re-run.

One more step, and it is the one people miss:

.. code-block:: bash

   loginctl enable-linger $USER

A user unit runs inside that account's own ``systemd --user`` instance, which
logind starts at login and tears down when the account's last session ends.
Without linger there is no user instance at boot, so the unit never runs, and it
stops again the moment you log out. ``osprey up`` already enables linger by
itself for a rootless-podman deployment running web terminals — rootless podman
puts the containers themselves under that same user instance, so they need it
too — but every other deployment needs the command run once by hand. On Docker
hosts the containers run under the Docker daemon and are unaffected by linger;
the unit that starts them is still a user unit, so it still needs it.

Check it the way you would check any unit:

.. code-block:: bash

   systemctl --user status osprey.service
   journalctl --user -u osprey.service -b

When the home directory is on a network mount
---------------------------------------------

Linger is not enough when ``$HOME`` is on NFS or autofs, and the scaffold verb
says so: it reads the home directory's filesystem type with ``findmnt`` and
prints a warning beside the install commands. The lingering user manager starts
at boot before that mount is there. It resolves its unit search path once,
finds nothing, and does not look again — so after every host reboot the unit
reads as ``not-found``, and ``podman.socket`` with it, until somebody runs
``systemctl --user daemon-reload`` by hand. It looks like a broken unit and it
is a mount-ordering problem.

When systemd manages the mount itself — an fstab entry, or a ``.mount`` or
``.automount`` unit — ordering the user manager after it is a drop-in on
``user@<uid>.service``, which OSPREY cannot install for you because it needs
root:

.. code-block:: ini

   # /etc/systemd/system/user@<uid>.service.d/network-home.conf
   [Unit]
   RequiresMountsFor=/home/<account>
   After=remote-fs.target autofs.service

Followed by ``sudo systemctl daemon-reload``. The command prints that file with
your own uid and home directory already filled in, ready to hand to whoever
administers the host. On a local home — or on a host with no ``findmnt``, where
there is no way to tell — it prints nothing extra.

That drop-in does nothing for a home served by the autofs daemon
(``automount(8)``): there is no systemd mount unit for ``RequiresMountsFor`` to
order against, so the manager starts exactly as before. ``findmnt`` reports
``autofs`` for a systemd automount as well, so the command cannot tell the two
apart — check ``systemctl list-units -t mount,automount`` for your home to know
which you have. For a daemon-managed home, and for any host where nobody with
root is available, the same run has already written the other route:
``scripts/osprey-boot-hook.sh``, beside the unit. It waits for the home, the
deployment and the user manager to appear, then reloads the unit files and
starts the unit — the script an affected site otherwise ends up writing by
hand. Wire it into the account's own crontab with the lines the command
prints, all of them, pasted whole:

.. code-block:: bash

   crontab -e
   SHELL=/bin/sh
   HOME=/
   @reboot d=/tmp/osprey-boot-hook.$(id -u); mkdir -m 700 "$d" 2>/dev/null; if [ -d "$d" ] && [ ! -L "$d" ] && [ -O "$d" ]; then log=/tmp/osprey-boot-hook.$(id -u)/boot.log; else log=/dev/null; fi; echo "$(date) osprey-boot-hook: cron fired" >> "$log"; n=0; until [ -x /path/to/repo/scripts/osprey-boot-hook.sh ] || [ $n -ge 120 ]; do sleep 5; n=$((n+1)); done; if [ -x /path/to/repo/scripts/osprey-boot-hook.sh ]; then exec /path/to/repo/scripts/osprey-boot-hook.sh; fi; echo "$(date) osprey-boot-hook: gave up, /path/to/repo/scripts/osprey-boot-hook.sh never appeared" | tee -a "$log"

The job is deliberately not a bare ``@reboot`` with the script's path, because
two things happen before a cron job's command runs and each one kills the job
silently on this kind of host. cron changes into the crontab's ``HOME`` first
and dies, with no mail, when that directory is not there yet — ``HOME=/``
gives it one that is, ``SHELL=/bin/sh`` names the shell the job is written
for whatever an existing crontab set above, and the script restores the real
home as its first act. Then ``sh`` has to read the script, which sits on the same late mount; so the
job, which lives in the crontab on the local disk, notes that cron fired it in
``/tmp/osprey-boot-hook.<uid>/boot.log`` and waits for the script to become
readable before running it. That log is the first place to look after a boot
that did not come back: it splits "cron never fired" from "still waiting for
the home" from "the hook ran and said why". Put the lines last in the
crontab: every job below them runs from ``/`` and sees ``HOME=/`` in its
environment, so a job body that expands ``$HOME`` breaks silently unless it
starts with its own ``export HOME=<the real home>``.

Where the drop-in applies, the hook repairs each boot after the fact rather
than ordering the manager correctly in the first place, so there it is a
fallback, not a replacement.

``osprey health`` reports this condition too: the ``systemd_unit`` category
is ``error`` when the unit is installed but the user manager reports it
``not-found``, ``warning`` when it was scaffolded but never installed, and
a skip on any host without a scaffolded unit or a user manager.

Why the unit runs ``osprey`` and not compose
--------------------------------------------

The unit's ``ExecStart`` is ``osprey up -d`` and its ``ExecStop`` is ``osprey
down`` — not a compose command against the rendered files in ``build/``. That is
deliberate. A compose invocation started by systemd would have to reproduce, by
hand and correctly, everything ``osprey up`` assembles around compose:

- ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME``, pinned to the project name in the configuration
  rather than left to compose's own fallback of the current directory's name.
  It decides which containers, networks and volumes the command addresses; get
  it wrong at boot and the host quietly grows a second copy of the stack beside
  the one your volumes belong to.
- ``OSPREY_ENV_DIGEST``, a hash of the ``.env`` chain that the rendered files
  carry as a container label. It is what makes an edit to ``.env`` reach a
  running container. A compose run that left it unset would look like a changed
  document on every boot and recreate the whole stack for no reason.
- The ``.env`` chain itself — ``.env.shared`` then ``.env`` — collapsed in the
  right order, and the repository pinned as compose's project directory so it
  resolves those files at all.
- The container runtime, which ``osprey up`` detects (or reads from the
  configuration) and then probes for the compose provider behind it; the
  supported providers do not take the same command line.
- Everything that is not compose: the host-port check that refuses before it
  touches a container, the drift check that refuses when ``build/`` no longer
  matches ``profile.yml``, minting any missing service credentials into
  ``.env``, the second compose invocation a multi-user deployment needs for its
  web tier, and ``scripts/verify.sh`` afterwards.

Wrapping the verb keeps all of that in one place: the unit is two commands, and
a boot does exactly what you do by hand.
