Panels
======

A **panel** is a self-contained, themed mini-app the Web Terminal shows as a tab
beside the chat. OSPREY's own tools — Channel Finder, ARIEL, the lattice
dashboard, the artifact gallery — are all panels, and you can add your own.
Because panels use the shared design tokens (:doc:`theming`), they match your
theme automatically, in light and dark, with no extra work.

Enable OSPREY's built-in panels in ``config.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   web:
     panels:
       ariel: true
       channel-finder: true
       lattice: true

Where the panel rail lives
--------------------------

Open panels line up in the **panel rail**, which sits along the left edge by
default. If your team prefers the panel buttons along the top, set
``web.rail_position: top`` in ``config.yml``, or switch from the panel ``+``
menu (or the command palette) at any time. The choice is remembered per
browser, and each user's own pick wins over the configured default. (Pair it
with the retro theme for a navy-and-teal terminal — see :doc:`theming`.)

Panels backed by a URL
----------------------

An entry under ``web.panels`` can also declare a **URL-backed panel** — a tab
that shows another web service inside the terminal. This is how the EVENTS
dashboard and the BLUESKY tab ship in the
``control-assistant`` preset (a build that includes those stacks registers
the entries for you):

.. code-block:: yaml

   web:
     panels:
       events:
         label: EVENTS
         url: http://127.0.0.1:8020    # the backing service
         path: /dashboard              # optional: page the tab opens (default /)
         health_endpoint: /healthz     # optional: lets the hub report status

The hub shows the service as a tab and proxies requests to it from the same
origin, so the browser never needs direct access to the backing port.

The Bluesky panel
-----------------

One tab covers a plan end to end, served by the ``bluesky-web`` sidecar.
**BLUESKY** (``/bluesky/``) has three views, and the queue's state — with
**Stop after current item** and **Abort running plan** — stays on screen across
all three:

**Plans** is where a plan is composed. It binds to the same shared draft the
OSPREY agent edits, so a field the agent sets glows in the form as it lands,
and a field you change by hand flows back to the agent. **Add to queue** puts
the exact revision on screen into the plan queue.

**Queue** lists what the queue server is holding, with **Start queue** and the
reorder/remove controls, plus the runs that have finished. Picking any run
opens it under Results. :doc:`/how-to/bluesky/queue` covers what those controls
do.

**Results** shows the selected run's record and its live figure, with the raw
data table collapsed underneath and a one-click CSV export.

Channel suggestions in plan forms
---------------------------------

A plan-form field that asks for a channel completes what you type: a popup
lists matching channel names — substring matches first, looser fuzzy matches
when those run dry. Arrow keys move through the list, **Enter** takes the
highlighted name, **Escape** dismisses it. The suggestions only suggest — a
name typed in full is accepted whether or not it appears in the list.

The names come from the project's Channel Finder catalog: ``osprey build``
writes a snapshot of it next to the generated config, and the panel reads
that snapshot — no control-system traffic, and nothing to keep in sync at run
time. A project with no channel database configured shows no suggestions and
is otherwise unchanged.

The feature is on by default, tuned under ``web.channel_suggestions`` in
``config.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   web:
     channel_suggestions:
       enabled: true         # the default
       max_channels: 50000   # the default

``max_channels`` guards the browser, not the build: every panel load fetches
the whole snapshot, so a database holding more channels than the limit is
skipped instead of shipped — the build log names the limit it hit, and the
form falls back to plain fields. Raise the limit to cover a larger facility,
or set ``enabled: false`` to turn the feature off and write no snapshot at
all. A build profile overrides these keys from its ``config:`` block in the
dotted form, e.g. ``web.channel_suggestions.max_channels: 200000``.

One staleness rule to know: editing a channel database inside the profile's
``data/`` tree changes the build fingerprint, so ``osprey up`` refuses until
you rebuild — the snapshot cannot silently go stale on that path. A database
referenced from *outside* the profile tree is not fingerprinted; its snapshot
refreshes only on the next explicit ``osprey build``.

Adding your own panel
---------------------

The easy path is the guided skill — a coding agent follows it to produce a
panel that already meets every rule:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey skills install creating-an-osprey-panel

Once the panel is written and validated, drop its folder under your project's
``panels/`` directory and turn on discovery:

.. code-block:: yaml

   web:
     allow_runtime_panels: true    # off by default

On the next start, every valid panel under ``panels/`` shows up as a tab. Invalid
ones are skipped and logged, so one bad panel never breaks the others.

.. warning::

   The Web Terminal has **no application-level login**. Turning on
   ``allow_runtime_panels`` serves whatever panels are on disk to anyone who can
   reach the port — right for the intended single-operator, local setup, but a
   facility that exposes the terminal more widely should put its own
   authentication in front of it.

Panel layouts ("presets")
-------------------------

A **layout** is a named set of panels an operator applies in one click — "the
machine-setup view is these four panels." Define them under ``web.presets``, where
each key is the menu label and each value is the exact set of panels to show:

.. code-block:: yaml

   web:
     presets:
       "Machine setup": [channel-finder, lattice, artifacts, okf]
       "Logbook review": [ariel, artifacts]

Each layout appears under a **Layouts** section at the top of the panel ``+``
menu. Picking one is *exclusive*: its panels open and every other panel closes.
Members must be enabled built-in panels or custom panels you have declared; an
unknown id is dropped with a warning, and a layout with no valid members is
skipped. When no ``web.presets`` are configured — the default — the ``+`` menu is
unchanged, so layouts never add clutter to a deployment that has not opted in.

Layouts are just a shortcut over adding and removing rail entries, so the OSPREY
agent can achieve the same result with its ``add_panel_to_rail`` /
``remove_panel_from_rail`` tools;
``list_panels`` reports the configured layouts so the agent can honor a request
like "set up for machine setup."

.. dropdown:: Going deeper — how panels work
   :icon: package

   You only need this to write a panel by hand or wire a new one into the hub;
   the ``creating-an-osprey-panel`` skill and the source (which the panel
   validator and its browser test suite back) are the real reference. The rough
   idea:

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Authoring rules

         A panel is one HTML entry point plus a ``manifest.json`` (its id, label,
         entry file, and version). Two rules make it theme itself for free, and a
         validator enforces both: it must **boot the shared theme before the page
         paints** (so it never flashes the wrong colors), and it must use **only
         design tokens** for color — never a raw hex value. Copy OSPREY's
         reference panel and you start compliant.

      .. tab-item:: Serving & discovery

         Discovered panels are served straight from disk, from the same origin as
         the terminal — no proxy. Discovery is **fail-closed**: only a fully valid
         panel is ever served. The ``allow_runtime_panels`` switch is deliberately
         off by default because it is also what lets the agent register panels at
         runtime — turning it on is your explicit decision to trust the panels the
         terminal makes available.

      .. tab-item:: Embedding contract

         The hub and its panels coordinate over a small shared contract — enough
         for a panel to pick up the current theme and to hide its own logo when
         embedded, so it sits flush inside the hub instead of showing two titles.
         The browser test suite is the exact, up-to-date spec; this is only the
         shape of it.
