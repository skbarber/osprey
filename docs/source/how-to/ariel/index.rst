Logbook Search Service (ARIEL)
================================

ARIEL (Agentic Retrieval Interface for Electronic Logbooks) provides intelligent
search over facility electronic logbooks. It is built around a **modular
architecture** with three main layers: a :doc:`data ingestion pipeline
<data-ingestion>` that normalizes logbook entries from any facility into a common
PostgreSQL schema, composable :doc:`search modules <search-modes>` such as
keyword and semantic similarity matching (plus a raw read-only ``sql_query``
MCP tool for structural queries the agent can run directly against the
database), and a :doc:`web interface
<web-interface>` for interactive exploration. These components connect to the
rest of Osprey through the :doc:`integration layer </reference/contracts/ariel>`, where
the agent invokes ARIEL's MCP tools as part of broader workflows.

Every layer is designed to be **facility-agnostic and extensible**. Ingestion
adapters, search modules, and enhancement stages are all registerable --- you can
implement your own and plug them into the full pipeline without modifying ARIEL's
source code. Out of the box, adapters are included for facilities such as ALS,
JLab, and ORNL, and search strategies range from fast keyword lookup to
embedding-based semantic similarity, with multi-step reasoning over results
delegated to the Osprey agent layer.

   ARIEL data flow: facility logbooks are normalized through pluggable adapters
   into a shared PostgreSQL database, enhanced by modular processing stages, and
   queried through composable search modules.

   ARIEL requires a working Osprey installation. Make sure you have the following
   ready before proceeding.

   - **Python 3.11+** with a virtual environment
   - **Osprey installed:** ``uv sync``
   - **Container runtime:** `Docker Desktop 4.0+ <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_ or `Podman 4.0+ <https://podman.io/getting-started/installation>`_ (for PostgreSQL)
   - **LLM API access:** An API key for your configured provider (e.g., ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``)
   - **(Recommended) Ollama** --- for local text embeddings powering semantic search:

     .. tab-set::

        .. tab-item:: macOS

           .. code-block:: bash

              brew install ollama
              ollama serve &            # Start Ollama in the background
              ollama pull nomic-embed-text

        .. tab-item:: Linux

           .. code-block:: bash

              curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
              ollama serve &            # Start Ollama in the background
              ollama pull nomic-embed-text

     Ollama is optional. ARIEL degrades gracefully to keyword-only search
     if Ollama or pgvector is unavailable. You can install them later and
     re-run ``osprey ariel quickstart`` to enable semantic search.

.. dropdown:: Quick Start

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: 1. Configure

         The easiest way to get started is to create a new project from the
         ``ariel-standalone`` template, which includes ARIEL pre-configured:

         .. code-block:: bash

            osprey init my-project --preset ariel-standalone
            cd my-project

         Run ``osprey build`` in it and you get a ready-to-use ``config.yml``
         with PostgreSQL, the ARIEL web interface, and all search modules
         enabled --- skip to Step 2. The repository's ``profile.yml`` is what
         the build reads, and its ``.env`` is where your provider keys belong.

      .. tab-item:: 2. Deploy

         Two commands bring everything up. The first run pulls container images,
         so it may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.

         Generate Docker Compose files from your ``config.yml``, pull the
         container images, and start them in the background:

         .. code-block:: bash

            osprey up -d

         Once the containers are running, connect to PostgreSQL, run database
         migrations, then ingest the demo logbook data and generate embeddings:

         .. code-block:: bash

            osprey ariel quickstart

      .. tab-item:: 3. Search

         Three ways to query the logbook:

         .. tab-set::

            .. tab-item:: Web Interface
               :selected:

               Start the ARIEL web UI in a separate terminal, then open it in
               your browser.

               .. code-block:: bash

                  osprey ariel web

               Then open ``http://localhost:10300`` in your browser.

            .. tab-item:: CLI Search

               Query the logbook service directly from the command line.

               .. code-block:: bash

                  osprey ariel search "What happened with the RF cavity?"

            .. tab-item:: Agent Chat

               Ask the Osprey agent. The logbook-search MCP tools connect the
               agent to the ARIEL search service, so it can combine logbook
               results with other context.

               .. code-block:: bash

                  osprey chat
                  >>> What does the logbook say about the last RF cavity trip?
