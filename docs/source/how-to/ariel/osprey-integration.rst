Osprey Integration
===================

ARIEL is integrated into Osprey as a dedicated MCP server
(``osprey.mcp_server.ariel``) that exposes the logbook search service to the
agent layer through a set of specialized tools. When a user asks a question
like "What happened with the RF cavity last week?", the Osprey agent selects
the appropriate ARIEL MCP tool based on the query type, which invokes the
``ARIELSearchService`` and returns structured results that the agent uses to
produce a cited answer. This page documents how that integration works: the
MCP tools, the service factory, and the search result structure.

Integration Architecture
========================

.. code-block:: text

   User Query
       ↓
   Osprey agent (via osprey chat)
       ↓  selects from ARIEL MCP tools
   ARIEL MCP Server → ARIELSearchService
       ↓
   Structured search results (entries + metadata)
       ↓
   Osprey agent → User Response

The flow begins when the Osprey agent determines that a user query involves
historical logbook data. It selects from ARIEL's specialized MCP tools based
on the query type --- for example, ``keyword_search`` for exact-match lookups,
``semantic_search`` for conceptual queries, or ``browse`` for exploring recent
entries. Each tool builds the appropriate request and routes it through the
``ARIELSearchService``. Results are returned directly to the agent, which
uses them to generate a cited response.


ARIEL MCP Tools
===============

ARIEL exposes the following tools through its dedicated MCP server. The
Osprey agent selects the appropriate tool based on the user's query.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Tool
     - Purpose
   * - ``keyword_search``
     - Full-text keyword search across logbook entries
   * - ``semantic_search``
     - Vector similarity search using embeddings
   * - ``sql_query``
     - Direct SQL queries against the logbook database
   * - ``browse``
     - Browse entries with pagination and filters
   * - ``filter_options``
     - Get distinct values for a filterable field (authors or source systems)
   * - ``status``
     - Check ARIEL service health and configuration
   * - ``entry_publish``
     - Publish an existing ARIEL entry to the facility logbook
   * - ``capabilities``
     - List available search capabilities and their status
   * - ``entry_get``
     - Retrieve a single entry by ID
   * - ``entries_by_ids``
     - Batch retrieve multiple entries by their IDs
   * - ``entry_create``
     - Create a new logbook entry

Search Result Structure
=======================

Internally, each search produces an ``ARIELSearchResult`` with the fields
below; the MCP tools serialize this into their own JSON envelope for the
agent:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 20 55

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
   * - ``entries``
     - ``tuple[dict, ...]``
     - Matching entries, ranked by relevance
   * - ``answer``
     - ``str | None``
     - Synthesized answer text (set by callers)
   * - ``sources``
     - ``tuple[str, ...]``
     - Entry IDs used as sources
   * - ``search_modes_used``
     - ``tuple[str, ...]``
     - Modes executed (e.g., ``keyword``, ``semantic``)
   * - ``reasoning``
     - ``str``
     - Explanation of results
   * - ``diagnostics``
     - ``tuple[SearchDiagnostic, ...]``
     - Structured diagnostics (level, source, message) from search execution


Service Factory
===============

The ``get_ariel_search_service()`` function provides a singleton
``ARIELSearchService`` instance. The service is lazily initialized from
``config.yml`` on first access and reused for subsequent calls.

.. code-block:: python

   from osprey.services.ariel_search.capability import get_ariel_search_service

   service = await get_ariel_search_service()
   async with service:
       result = await service.search(query="RF cavity fault")

**Lifecycle:** The singleton is created once per process. In the web
interface, the ``create_app()`` factory manages its own service instance
through the FastAPI lifespan. For cleanup in tests, use
``close_ariel_service()`` (closes the connection pool) or
``reset_ariel_service()`` (resets without closing).

Extending the integration
=========================

ARIEL is the interface to logbook data. A facility adapter ingests entries,
data enhancement enriches them, and pluggable search modules expose them.
Multi-step reasoning, answer synthesis, and any custom workflow over ARIEL's
results live in the agent layer, not in ARIEL itself.

The recommended way to build such a workflow is to write a skill. Skills run
inside the Osprey agent, can call ARIEL's MCP tools directly, and ship inside
your build profile under ``skills/`` --- see :doc:`/how-to/build-profiles`.
