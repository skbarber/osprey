Use the CLI Chat Interface
==========================

The CLI chat interface launches the Osprey agent in your native terminal while
running OSPREY's companion services in the background. This runs the agent
in the full terminal TUI — keyboard shortcuts, slash commands, native
scrollback — with access to companion services (artifact gallery, session
analytics, etc.) via their URLs in a browser.

Launching
---------

From anywhere inside a deployment repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey chat

This command:

1. Finds the deployment by walking up to the nearest ``profile.yml``, and starts
   the agent in that repository's ``build/`` — nothing is re-rendered, since
   ``osprey build`` owns that. A profile that has changed since the last build
   is reported as a warning and the session starts anyway.
2. Resolves the configured LLM provider and injects authentication.
3. Starts the translation proxy if the provider needs it (see
   :doc:`configure-providers`).
4. Launches companion web servers in the background.
5. Opens the Osprey agent TUI in your terminal.

Options
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey chat --repo /path/to/deployment    # explicit deployment repo
   osprey chat --resume SESSION_ID           # resume a previous session
   osprey chat --print                       # non-interactive (pipe-friendly)
   osprey chat --effort high                 # set effort level
   osprey chat --no-pin                      # ignore the pinned CLI version

When ``--repo`` is omitted, the deployment enclosing the current directory is used.

If ``claude_code.cli_version`` is set in ``config.yml``, chat launches that
exact agent CLI version instead of whatever is installed globally, so every
launch of the project behaves the same. ``--no-pin`` opts out and uses the
global installation.

Companion Services
------------------

On startup, ``osprey chat`` launches the same companion servers as
``osprey web``. Each server's URL is printed before the Osprey agent starts:

.. code-block:: text

   Companion servers
     Artifact gallery   http://127.0.0.1:8086
     ARIEL server       http://127.0.0.1:8085

Open any of these URLs in a browser to access the service while the Osprey agent
runs in your terminal. Which servers start depends on your ``config.yml`` —
each server respects its own ``auto_launch`` setting.

The servers run as background threads and stop automatically when you exit
the Osprey agent.

When to Use CLI vs. Web Terminal
--------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - CLI chat (``osprey chat``)
     - Web terminal (``osprey web``)
   * - Native terminal experience
     - Browser-based split-pane UI
   * - Full Osprey agent TUI with keyboard shortcuts
     - Embedded terminal emulator
   * - Companion services in separate browser tabs
     - Companion services as side panels
   * - No additional port for the terminal itself
     - Terminal served on port 8087
   * - Ideal for SSH or remote sessions
     - Ideal for local development with visual tools

Both modes launch the same MCP servers, companion services, and translation
proxy. The agent capabilities are identical.
