How to Use the Channel Finder
==============================

The Channel Finder translates natural language queries (e.g., "beam current,"
"terminal voltage") into control system addresses (e.g., ``SR:DCCT:Current``,
``TMVST``). It uses LLM-based pipelines, so a query can use everyday terms
rather than exact channel names.

      Where the Channel Finder sits among OSPREY's retrieval stacks --- it is
      the one that uses no embeddings at all.

   :doc:`/reference/contracts/channel-finder`
      The database JSON schemas, the ``config.yml`` keys, and how the active
      pipeline is served to the agent.


Choosing a Pipeline
===================

Set the active pipeline in ``config.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   channel_finder:
     pipeline_mode: in_context  # or "hierarchical", "middle_layer" or "graph"

When ``pipeline_mode`` is unset, OSPREY auto-detects: it uses the first
pipeline that has a database configured, preferring middle layer, then
hierarchical, then in-context. Auto-detection never lands on ``graph`` — that
pipeline reads no database file, so there is nothing to detect and you name it
explicitly.

+---------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Pipeline                  | Best for                                     |
+===========================+==============================================+
| **In-Context**            | Small/medium systems (< few hundred channels)|
+---------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| **Hierarchical**          | Large systems with strict naming patterns    |
+---------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| **Middle Layer**          | Large systems organized by function (MML)    |
+---------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| **Graph**                 | Machines described in a knowledge graph      |
+---------------------------+----------------------------------------------+

The three are not size tiers of one design. Each takes a differently shaped
database and resolves a query by a different mechanism:

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../_diagrams/channel-finder-pipelines.html


In-Context Pipeline
===================

Loads the entire channel database into the LLM context for direct semantic
matching.

**How it works:** a single inner-LLM call — the complete channel database is
embedded in the system prompt and the model returns the most relevant channels
in one shot (no query-splitting or iterative-correction stage).

The database is a flat JSON structure loaded by ``TemplateChannelDatabase``,
with standalone entries and template entries for device families --- see
:doc:`/reference/contracts/channel-finder` for the schema.

Build a database from CSV, then validate and preview:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey channel-finder build-database --use-llm
   osprey channel-finder validate
   osprey channel-finder preview

.. note::

   ``build-database`` writes into the **profile** the project was built from
   (``processed/channel_database.json`` inside its ``data/`` tree), not into the
   project — a generated database belongs beside the inputs it came from, and
   survives a rebuild there. That deliberately marks the project stale; clear
   the advisory by rebuilding:

   .. code-block:: bash

      osprey channel-finder build-database
      osprey build

   The pipelines — and a bare ``validate`` / ``preview`` — read the database
   referenced in ``config.yml`` (under ``data/channel_databases/``). If you
   built to a different name, either point the commands at it with
   ``--database`` or update the config path; otherwise you are silently
   validating the old database.


Hierarchical Pipeline
=====================

Navigates a nested hierarchy (system, family, device, field, subfield) using
recursive LLM-guided selection at each level.

The database declares the levels the pipeline navigates and the naming pattern
the addresses follow --- see :doc:`/reference/contracts/channel-finder` for the
schema.

Advanced features: navigation-only levels, friendly names via
``_channel_part``, optional levels with ``_is_leaf``, and custom separators
via ``_separator``.

Validate and preview:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey channel-finder validate
   osprey channel-finder preview --depth 4 --sections tree,stats


Middle Layer Pipeline
=====================

A React agent explores the database using query tools
(``list_systems``, ``list_families``, ``inspect_fields``,
``list_channels``, ``get_common_names``, ``statistics``, ``validate``, and —
when DuckDB is installed — ``run_sql``).

The database follows MATLAB Middle Layer (MML) functional organization
(System -> Family -> Field -> ChannelNames). Convert from MML exports:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m osprey.services.channel_finder.utils.mml_converter \
      --input path/to/mml_exports.py:MML_ao_SR \
      --output data/channel_databases/middle_layer.json


Graph Pipeline
==============

Searches the facility knowledge graph instead of a channel database. The store
*is* the database: a graph-mode project ships no database file, and the channel
finder subagent finds addresses by writing read-only Cypher against the seeded
``graphdb`` store.

**How it works:** four tools, served under the ``channel-finder`` name like
every other pipeline's. ``capabilities`` reports how addresses are spelled and
what prose the corpus carries; ``example_queries`` returns runnable Cypher for
the common channel questions, each with framework-default parameter values that
the seed-time snapshot may replace with values captured from this corpus;
``get_schema`` lists the labels, relationship types and property names
*this* graph actually holds; ``read_cypher`` runs one query and returns rows.
There is no resolution API behind them — the subagent adapts an example rather
than calling a lookup.

Configuration is the mode plus the store, and nothing else. There is no graph
entry under ``pipelines:`` — that section renders empty in graph mode — and no
``tier``, because the pipeline has no tiered artifacts:

.. code-block:: yaml

   channel_finder:
     pipeline_mode: graph
     pipelines:        # nothing here — graph names no database file

The store comes from the ``services.graphdb`` block, either one this deployment
runs or one the facility already hosts (an explicit ``services.graphdb.uri``
and ``username``, with ``GRAPHDB_PASSWORD`` in the project ``.env``). See
:ref:`profile-graph-mode` for both shapes, and :doc:`deploy-project/index` for the
block itself. A build that enables the channel finder but renders no
``services.graphdb`` block is refused, naming the missing block, rather than
shipping a pipeline with nothing to read — which is why the
``channel_finder_standalone`` app template, which carries no such block, cannot
run this mode.

Load the corpus into the store:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey knowledge seed-graph data/demo_machine.ttl

``osprey up`` does that for you when the deployment runs the store; a store the
facility hosts holds whatever was loaded into it, so seed it deliberately. See
:doc:`facility-knowledge/use-facility-graph` for what the graph holds and how a corpus is
generated.

**What the subagent can search** depends on the corpus. On a corpus
``osprey knowledge build-ttl`` generated — the demo machine — a phrase can be
matched against the description written for a single channel, against what the
last two tokens of an address mean, against the prose for a device family, a
system or a ring, and against the synonyms an operator would say out loud. A
corpus imported from a facility export may carry less prose: there the way in
is a name, an alternate name, a section or a device class.

``validate`` and ``preview`` have no file to open on this pipeline, so both
report what the store is and which commands act on it. Health reports the store
instead of a database: whether it is reachable, and how many resources it holds
(:doc:`health-and-monitoring/configure-health-checks`).

The web explorer opens on this pipeline too, and reads the same store: its
Explore view draws the device classes the corpus holds rather than a channel
tree. See `Web Interface`_ below.


Web Interface
=============

Launch the browser-based channel explorer:

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey channel-finder web
   osprey channel-finder web --port 9000

The explorer browses a channel database. On the graph pipeline there is no such
file, so its Explore view shows the facility ontology instead: the store's
device classes drawn as a tree, each class carrying the number of devices under
it and its subclasses, below a legend of the relationship types the store uses.
A badge names the corpus file and the store it was loaded into, and chips name
the tools the OSPREY agent queries that same store with. The header counts
devices, channels, classes, signals and sections read live from the store; if
the store is unreachable the view says so and offers a Retry, and if it is
reachable but empty it names the ``osprey knowledge seed-graph`` command that
fills it. Channel validation is not offered on this pipeline. Ask the OSPREY
agent for the channels you need — it answers from the graph. The
channel-suggestion typeahead in the web panels still works in graph mode:
``osprey build`` reads the channel names out of the Turtle corpus named by
``services.graphdb.ttl_path`` and writes them into the snapshot the panels
use.


The ``config.yml`` keys for every pipeline, and how the active one is served to
the agent, are in :doc:`/reference/contracts/channel-finder`.
