Bluesky Plans
=============

The Osprey agent can run real measurement plans — sweep magnets, read beam
monitors, and collect the data — through the same chat and panels you already
use. Three promises shape everything on these pages: a plan waits in a
**queue** until a human deliberately starts it, the queue **survives
restarts**, and **stopping is never locked** — not by any switch, on any
surface.

      Ten minutes on the Virtual Accelerator — ask for a plan in plain words,
      press two buttons, watch the points land. Nothing to configure.

      How running actually works: the queue, what needs arming, and the two
      ways to stop.

      Let the agent draft a new plan for you, or install your facility's own
      plan library.
