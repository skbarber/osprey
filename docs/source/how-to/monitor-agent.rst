Overview
========

The OSPREY agent can emit its operational telemetry — structured event logs and
runtime metrics — over the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). Projects built from
the bundled presets ship with telemetry **already enabled** and pointed at the
local OpenObserve store; the mechanism itself only stays off when a config has
no ``telemetry:`` block under ``claude_code:``. There are two ways to consume
it:

- **Phase 1 — any OTLP endpoint (backend-agnostic).** Point the agent at an
  OTLP collector or observability platform you already run. OSPREY only produces
  OTLP; it does not care what receives it.
- **Phase 2 — the local OpenObserve add-on (the scaffolded default).** A
  single-binary OpenObserve store deployed next to your project with
  ``osprey up``; all telemetry stays on the same host. This is the
  turn-key option when you have no existing observability stack.

.. note::

   Only logs and metrics are wired. Distributed **tracing** (and the
   ``OTEL_LOG_TOOL_CONTENT`` toggle) is intentionally left out of this
   configuration surface.

Phase 1 — Emit to any OTLP endpoint
===================================

Add a ``telemetry:`` block under ``claude_code:`` in your project's
``config.yml``. The minimal backend-agnostic form only needs to be enabled and
pointed at an endpoint:

.. code-block:: yaml

   claude_code:
     telemetry:
       enabled: true
       endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT}   # your OTLP collector
       protocol: http/protobuf                    # default; or grpc
       resource_attributes:                       # attached to every record
         service.name: osprey-agent
         deployment.environment: dev

   * - Key
     - Meaning
   * - ``enabled``
     - Master switch. ``false`` (the default) emits nothing.
   * - ``backend``
     - Backend hint — ``generic`` for a plain OTLP endpoint, ``openobserve``
       for the Phase 2 add-on.
   * - ``endpoint``
     - OTLP base endpoint. Use the ``${VAR}`` form so the value comes from your
       ``.env`` rather than being committed to ``config.yml``.
   * - ``protocol``
     - OTLP transport. Defaults to ``http/protobuf``. ``grpc`` requires an
       explicit ``endpoint``: it is refused against the auto-derived
       ``openobserve`` endpoint, which is HTTP-only.
   * - ``headers``
     - Extra OTLP headers (for example, routing or auth headers your backend
       requires).
   * - ``resource_attributes``
     - Attributes stamped onto every emitted record — useful for separating
       environments or agent instances in your backend.

Set the endpoint in your profile's ``.env`` — the build derives the project's
from it — then run the agent as usual:

.. code-block:: bash

   # .env
   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otel-collector.example.com

That is all Phase 1 requires — the agent begins emitting on its next run.

Phase 2 — The local OpenObserve add-on
======================================

If you do not already run an observability stack, OSPREY ships an
`OpenObserve <https://openobserve.ai/>`_ service: a single binary that ingests
OTLP directly and serves a browser UI, with no external dependencies. Everything
stays on the deploy host.

1. Check the service is enabled
-------------------------------

Projects ship with the ``openobserve`` service already declared in
``config.yml`` **and** listed under ``deployed_services`` — it deploys by
default. If your project removed it, restore it:

.. code-block:: yaml

   services:
     openobserve:
       path: ./services/openobserve
       port: 5080          # host port for the UI + OTLP ingest

   deployed_services:
     - openobserve

2. (Optional) set the admin credentials
---------------------------------------

The OpenObserve root account doubles as the OTLP ingest credential. You do not
have to set it yourself: the first ``osprey up`` writes **both halves of the
login** into the profile's ``.env`` — a minted ``ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD`` and the
account name ``ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL`` — and the project's ``.env`` is derived from
there. So the answer to "what do I log in with" is always ``.env``:

.. code-block:: bash

   grep ZO_ROOT_USER ~/my-project/.env

The minted password is short on purpose: you read it off a terminal and type it
into a browser login form, so it is 12 characters drawn from an alphabet with
the easily-misread characters (``l I 1 O 0``) removed. Every character still
comes from a cryptographic random source, so it is short to type without being
easy to guess.

Set the two variables yourself (in the profile's ``.env``) if you want specific
values — the same pair configures the container **and** authenticates the
agent's OTLP push, one source of truth:

.. code-block:: bash

   # .env
   ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL=you@example.com
   ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD=choose-a-strong-password

.. important::

   **Publishing this store beyond** ``localhost`` **exposes agent transcripts.**
   It holds full agent conversation transcripts, and the same credentials serve
   both its browser login and the agent's OTLP push. Reach it over an SSH
   tunnel, or put it behind TLS, rather than binding it to every interface. The
   minted password is a per-deploy random value, so it stays usable wherever the
   store is published — what exposure changes is who can reach the login, not
   how strong the password is.

3. Deploy it
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   osprey up        # brings up openobserve alongside your other services

The UI is then available at ``http://localhost:5080`` (log in with the
credentials above). Verify the service is recognized with ``osprey health``.

4. Point the agent at it
------------------------

Wire the ``telemetry:`` block to ``backend: openobserve`` and supply the
OpenObserve auth in the ``openobserve:`` sub-block. **Do not set** ``endpoint``
for this backend — omit it and the agent derives the OTLP ingest URL
automatically per network context:

.. code-block:: yaml

   claude_code:
     telemetry:
       enabled: true
       backend: openobserve
       # No `endpoint:` here — for the openobserve backend it is derived
       # automatically (see the note below).
       protocol: http/protobuf
       openobserve:
         user: ${ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL}
         password: ${ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD}
         org: default

.. important::

   For ``backend: openobserve`` the OTLP endpoint is **auto-derived** and you
   should not hardcode it. The derived form is ``http://<host>:5080/api/<org>``
   — note the ``5080`` is fixed: the derivation does *not* follow a changed
   ``services.openobserve.port``, so if you publish the store on a different
   host port, set ``endpoint:`` explicitly instead. The ``<host>`` part is
   chosen for the running context:

   - **On the host** (``osprey web`` / ``osprey query`` on your machine) the host
     is ``localhost`` — the store's published port.
   - **Inside a bridge-networked container** (for example the containerized
     dispatch worker) the store is reachable only by its compose service DNS
     name, ``openobserve``. The framework's dispatch-worker service declares this
     by setting ``OSPREY_OTEL_OPENOBSERVE_HOST=openobserve`` in its compose
     environment. That explicit declaration — rather than sniffing the container
     runtime — is what makes emit work identically under Docker and Podman.

   If you run your own containerized emitter, set
   ``OSPREY_OTEL_OPENOBSERVE_HOST`` to whatever host reaches OpenObserve from
   inside that container: the compose service name on a bridge network, or
   ``localhost`` when the container uses host networking (``network_mode: host``),
   where the compose DNS name would not resolve. Leave it unset on a plain host
   run. Hardcoding ``endpoint:`` instead would point every context at the same
   host and silently drop records from the ones it doesn't fit.

On its next run the agent emits to OpenObserve, and its logs and metrics appear
in the UI.

Content capture
===============

By default the agent captures **full content** in its telemetry — operator
prompts, agent responses, tool calls, and raw provider bodies. Because the
Phase 2 store is local and air-gapped, this full-fidelity posture is the
default: nothing leaves the host, and complete transcripts make post-incident
review far more useful.

Four independent gates control it, all defaulting **on**. Set any to ``false``
to suppress that category from emitted telemetry:

.. code-block:: yaml

   claude_code:
     telemetry:
       enabled: true
       log_user_prompts: true          # operator chat prompts
       log_assistant_responses: true   # agent replies
       log_tool_details: true          # tool names + arguments
       log_raw_api_bodies: true        # raw provider request/response bodies

If you route telemetry to a shared or off-host backend (Phase 1), review these
gates and disable the categories you do not want to leave the machine.

Caveats
=======

- **Single admin.** The OpenObserve add-on provisions one root account from
  ``ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL`` / ``ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD``. It is intended for a
  single operator or a small trusted team on the deploy host, not for
  multi-tenant access control.
- **Data volume growth is bounded by retention, not a size cap.** Ingested
  telemetry persists in a named container volume, which has no portable hard
  size limit — so the store is bounded by *age*: ``services.openobserve.retention_days``
  (default 14) sets ``ZO_COMPACT_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS`` in the container, dropping
  telemetry older than N days (OpenObserve's floor is 3 days). Raise it for
  longer history, but watch disk. Removing the volume still discards all history;
  back it up if you need retention across redeploys.
- **Health.** ``osprey health`` reports the store's ``/healthz`` readiness (a
  running container is not necessarily ready), the effective retention (warning
  if below OpenObserve's floor of 3 days), and the percentage-full of the disk
  the volume grows into.
- **Local by design.** The service binds to localhost by default. Do not expose
  port 5080 beyond the host without putting authentication and transport
  security in front of it.
