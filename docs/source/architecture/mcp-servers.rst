MCP Servers
===========

OSPREY exposes control system operations, data retrieval, and workspace
management as tools through `FastMCP <https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp>`_
servers. The Osprey agent discovers servers from ``.mcp.json`` at startup and calls
tools via stdio JSON-RPC. The **10 core in-tree servers** below are the ones a
deployment normally renders; build profiles can inject additional servers beyond
them.

The four channel-finder variants count as four of the ten, but a deployment
serves exactly one of them — whichever ``channel_finder.pipeline_mode`` names —
under the single ``channel-finder`` name, which is why the map shows seven
running processes.


Control System
--------------

``control_system``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Package: ``osprey.mcp_server.control_system``

Reads and writes control system channels and queries archiver history.
This is the primary server for live hardware interaction and includes
safety-limits enforcement on all write operations.

**Tools:**

- ``channel_read`` -- Read current values from one or more control system channels.
- ``channel_write`` -- Write values to one or more control system channels (requires human approval).
- ``archiver_read`` -- Retrieve historical archived data for one or more channels over a
  time range. ``processing`` selects the per-bin aggregation (``raw``, ``mean``, ``min``,
  ``max``, ``median``, ``std``, ``count``) and ``bin_size`` sets the bin width in seconds;
  ``bin_size=0`` returns full resolution and is valid only with ``processing="raw"``.
  When ``bin_size`` is omitted the bin is derived from the time span so a continuously
  archived channel returns about ``archiver.auto_bin_points`` (default 10 000) points —
  1 s for anything under ~2.8 hours, ~53 minutes for a year — and the summary reports the
  bin that was used and whether it was requested or chosen automatically.
- ``channel_limits`` -- Query the channel safety limits database (lookup, pattern match, summary).


Channel Finding
---------------

OSPREY provides four channel finder variants, each suited to different
facility data models and search strategies. A deployment picks one with
``channel_finder.pipeline_mode``, and whichever it picks is served under the one
``channel-finder`` name.

``channel_finder_hierarchical``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Package: ``osprey.mcp_server.channel_finder_hierarchical``

Finds channel addresses using a hierarchical drill-down through an
in-memory JSON database. Users navigate levels (system, subsystem,
device, signal) to narrow results.

**Tools:**

- ``get_options`` -- Get available options at a specific hierarchy level, filtered by prior selections.
- ``build_channels`` -- Build channel addresses from a set of hierarchy selections.
- ``view_examples`` -- View operator-verified search examples from prior sessions.

``channel_finder_in_context``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Package: ``osprey.mcp_server.channel_finder_in_context``

Answers natural-language questions about channels by handing the full
channel database to an inner LLM as context. Designed for databases small
enough to fit in a single context window.

**Tools:**

- ``ask_channels`` -- Answer a natural-language question about channels; an inner LLM call sees the full channel database as context and returns the answer text together with tokenizer-estimated input/output token counts (used by the benchmark harness for cost accounting).

``channel_finder_middle_layer``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Package: ``osprey.mcp_server.channel_finder_middle_layer``

Exposes the MATLAB Middle Layer (MML) channel database as MCP tools.
Organized by system, family, and field with support for common-name
lookups and validation.

**Tools:**

- ``list_systems`` -- List all systems in the channel database with descriptions.
- ``list_families`` -- List device families in a system with descriptions.
- ``list_channels`` -- Get channel names for a system/family/field path.
- ``get_common_names`` -- Get common (friendly) names for devices in a family.
- ``inspect_fields`` -- Inspect the field structure of a device family.
- ``validate`` -- Validate that channel names exist in the database.
- ``statistics`` -- Get database statistics (total channels, systems, families).
- ``run_sql`` -- Run a read-only SQL query directly against the channel finder DuckDB database (``channels``, ``systems``, ``families`` tables).

``channel_finder_graph``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Package: ``osprey.mcp_server.channel_finder_graph``

Finds channels by searching the facility knowledge graph. Instead of drilling
through a database file, the agent writes read-only Cypher against the seeded
``graphdb`` store, so a question can start from a description, an alternate name
or a system just as easily as from an address. Selected with
``channel_finder.pipeline_mode: graph``, and needs a ``services.graphdb`` store
to search -- deployed with the rest of the stack, or one the facility already
runs.

``read_cypher`` and ``get_schema`` are the ``graph`` server's own tools, served
here under the ``channel-finder`` name: the same read transaction, the same
refusal of extension procedures and ``LOAD CSV``, the same row and time bounds.
The examples catalogue is this package's own, written around the questions
operators ask about channels rather than around general graph exploration. See
:doc:`/how-to/facility-knowledge/use-facility-graph`.

**Tools:**

- ``read_cypher`` -- Run one read-only Cypher query and return the matching rows,
  bounded by ``services.graphdb.query_max_rows`` and
  ``services.graphdb.query_timeout_s``.
- ``get_schema`` -- Report the node labels, relationship types, sampled per-label
  property names and namespace prefixes this graph holds.
- ``example_queries`` -- Return runnable Cypher examples for the common channel
  questions, each with per-corpus parameter values.
- ``capabilities`` -- Report the server description, tool list and operating notes.

Workspace
---------

``workspace``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Package: ``osprey.mcp_server.workspace``

Manages artifacts, data context, screen capture, visualizations,
documents, and session state. This is the largest server, grouping
tools into several functional areas.

**Artifacts:**

- ``artifact_register`` -- Register a file on disk, or literal text, as a gallery artifact.
- ``artifact_get`` -- Look up an artifact by ID to get its file path and metadata.
- ``artifact_list`` -- List stored artifacts, optionally narrowed by category, tool or agent.
- ``artifact_read`` -- Read a stored artifact's full content (small artifacts only).
- ``artifact_delete`` -- Delete an artifact from the gallery.
- ``artifact_delete_all`` -- Delete a whole scope of artifacts (one category, or everything)
  in a single call. The ``scope`` argument is required.
- ``artifact_export`` -- Export an artifact to a different format (e.g., PNG, SVG, PDF).
- ``artifact_focus`` -- Select an artifact in the gallery so the user sees it.
- ``artifact_pin`` -- Pin or unpin an artifact for quick-access filtering.

**Visualization:**

- ``create_static_plot`` -- Execute Python/Matplotlib code to produce a static plot image.
- ``create_interactive_plot`` -- Execute Plotly code to produce an interactive HTML plot.
- ``create_dashboard`` -- Execute Panel/Bokeh code to produce a live dashboard app.
- ``create_document`` -- Compile LaTeX source to PDF (Beamer slides or article reports).

**Stored data:**

Datasets are not a separate namespace -- an archiver read or a run result is an
artifact with a ``category``, so the artifact tools above list, read and delete
them (``artifact_list(category="archiver_data")``).

- ``archiver_downsample`` -- Downsample an archiver artifact to a target point count.

**Lattice Dashboard:**

- ``lattice_init`` -- Load a lattice file into the dashboard and compute optics.
- ``lattice_state`` -- Get current lattice state (summary, families, figures, baseline).
- ``lattice_set_param`` -- Set a magnet family parameter override.
- ``lattice_refresh`` -- Trigger recomputation of lattice figures.
- ``lattice_set_baseline`` -- Snapshot the current state as the comparison baseline.
- ``lattice_clear_baseline`` -- Discard the saved comparison baseline.
- ``lattice_get_figure`` -- Retrieve a rendered lattice figure (e.g., optics, layout) by name.
- ``lattice_get_data`` -- Retrieve the underlying numeric data behind a named figure.
- ``lattice_get_settings`` -- Get current dashboard settings (display options, baselines).
- ``lattice_update_settings`` -- Update dashboard settings.

**Panels:**

- ``list_panels`` -- List the panels available in the Web Terminal (built-in and custom).
- ``open_panel`` -- Put a panel on screen in front of the operator.
- ``close_panel`` -- Take a panel's tile off screen, leaving it on the rail.
- ``add_panel_to_rail`` -- Make a panel launchable from the rail in one click.
- ``remove_panel_from_rail`` -- Take a panel off the rail (and off screen with it).

**Screen Capture:**

- ``screenshot_capture`` -- Capture a screenshot (full screen, window, or region).
- ``list_windows`` -- List visible windows with optional app filter.
- ``manage_window`` -- Manage window state (raise, minimize, resize).

**Session:**

- ``session_log`` -- Retrieve the structured session activity log.
- ``session_summary`` -- Return a compact inventory of all data and artifacts in the session.
- ``submit_response`` -- Submit a formatted response to the web terminal.
- ``facility_description`` -- Get facility description and context.

**Setup / Diagnostics:**

- ``setup_inspect`` -- Inspect OSPREY agent configuration (config files, env vars, MCP state).
- ``setup_patch`` -- Modify an OSPREY configuration file (config.yml or .mcp.json).


Python Executor
---------------

``python_executor``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Package: ``osprey.mcp_server.python_executor``

Runs agent-authored Python as a separate process on the host --- a process
boundary with limits enforcement and timeout protection, not a sandbox; see
:doc:`/architecture/python-executor`.

**Tools:**

- ``execute`` -- Execute Python code with safety checks, process isolation, and timeout.
- ``execute_file`` -- Execute a Python file from the workspace with the same safety envelope as ``execute``.


ARIEL
-----

``ariel``
~~~~~~~~~

Package: ``osprey.mcp_server.ariel``

Searches facility logbook entries and operational records. Supports
keyword search, semantic (embedding-based) search, direct SQL queries,
and entry creation with attachments.

**Tools:**

- ``browse`` -- Browse recent logbook entries with optional date and field filtering.
- ``filter_options`` -- Get distinct values for a filterable field (authors, systems, etc.).
- ``keyword_search`` -- Search the logbook using PostgreSQL full-text keyword search.
- ``semantic_search`` -- Search the logbook using embedding-based semantic similarity.
- ``sql_query`` -- Execute a read-only SQL query against the logbook database.
- ``entry_get`` -- Get a single logbook entry by its ID.
- ``entries_by_ids`` -- Get multiple logbook entries by their IDs in a single call.
- ``entry_create`` -- Create a new logbook entry, optionally with file attachments.
- ``entry_publish`` -- Publish an existing ARIEL entry to the facility logbook.
- ``capabilities`` -- Report available ARIEL search capabilities.
- ``status`` -- Get ARIEL service health, database connectivity, and statistics.


Facility Knowledge
------------------

``osprey_facility_knowledge``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Package: ``osprey.mcp_server.facility_knowledge``

Serves a facility's curated knowledge bundle (OKF §2 concept documents) so the
agent can look up operational know-how and draft new concepts for human review.

**Tools:**

- ``capabilities`` -- Report facility knowledge bundle capabilities.
- ``list_concepts`` -- List all concepts in the facility knowledge bundle.
- ``read_concept`` -- Read a concept document by its OKF §2 concept ID.
- ``search`` -- Search the facility knowledge bundle for a query string.
- ``draft_concept`` -- Draft a new concept document for human review and approval.


Facility Graph
--------------

``graph``
~~~~~~~~~

Package: ``osprey.mcp_server.graph``

Read-only Cypher search over the facility knowledge graph -- the
NARAD-convention RDF corpus held by the ``graphdb`` store. Rendered only where
``services.graphdb`` is configured, and called by the
**facility-knowledge-graph subagent**: the main agent's route to the graph is
delegation, mirroring the channel finder. Every query runs in a read
transaction, and extension procedures, extension functions and ``LOAD CSV`` are
refused before the store is dialed. See :doc:`/how-to/facility-knowledge/use-facility-graph`.

**Tools:**

- ``read_cypher`` -- Run one read-only Cypher query and return the matching rows,
  bounded by ``services.graphdb.query_max_rows`` and
  ``services.graphdb.query_timeout_s``.
- ``get_schema`` -- Report the node labels, relationship types, sampled per-label
  property names and namespace prefixes this graph holds.
- ``example_queries`` -- Return curated, runnable Cypher examples for the common
  question shapes, each with per-corpus parameter values.
- ``capabilities`` -- Report the server description, tool list and operating notes.
