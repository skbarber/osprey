"""Render a self-contained HTML dashboard for the CBORG e2e model matrix (#259).

Reads results/<model>__seed<seed>.json (the summary schema emitted by
run_e2e_for_model.sh) and produces a single static HTML file (inline CSS, no
external deps) with:

  * run metadata + methodology footer (override mechanism, proxy, cap, drops),
  * a model x seed summary matrix (pass-rate heatmap + counts + wall-clock),
  * a per-test heatmap (one row per model-driving test x model cols; cell = passes across seeds),
    grouped by test file, so you can see exactly which capabilities each model
    holds up on weak -> strong.

Partial-data friendly: missing (model,seed) runs render as "pending". Usage:
