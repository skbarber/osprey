"""Does a pcaspy server poison a pyepics Channel Access client in the same process?

pythonSoftIOC does: importing its server into a process breaks Channel Access
client operation in that same process, which is why the softioc test suites had
to be split across subprocesses. pcaspy is a different server implementation, so
the answer has to be established rather than assumed -- it decides whether the
rewritten record-factory and fault tests can be plain in-process tests or need a
subprocess split.

Run it against the probe server left up by
``PROBE_KEEP_CONTAINER=1 bash run_probe.sh``::

    python coexistence_check.py

Prints one ``PHASE <name> PASS|FAIL -- <detail>`` line per phase and a final
``COEXISTS=yes|no``. Exits 0 whenever it reached a trustworthy verdict; exits
non-zero only if the harness itself could not be trusted (the control failed, so
a negative result would say nothing about pcaspy).

Phases, each in its own clean process so a crash in one cannot be misattributed:

- ``control``           no pcaspy anywhere: caput a sentinel, read it back.
- ``control-negative``  no pcaspy, wrong name-server port: must be unreachable.
- ``server-first``      import pcaspy and build the server, *then* caget. This is
                        the direction that threatens the tests.
- ``server-first-negative``  same, wrong port: must be unreachable.
- ``client-first``      caget, then build the server, then caget again -- a suite
                        may import in either order.

The local pvdb deliberately reuses the container's PV names with a sentinel-free
default, so a caget that returned the local (unserved) copy instead of the
container's would be caught by the value comparison, and the negative phases
catch any other discovery path.

Mechanism, for whoever has to act on the verdict: ``pcaspy/_cas...so`` links the
EPICS libraries statically and globally exports ~59 ``ca_*`` symbols -- it embeds
a complete second copy of the CA *client*, not just the portable server. Whichever
EPICS stack binds first wins, so importing pcaspy before pyepics has initialised
libca hands the client's ``ca_*`` calls to pcaspy's copy, whose context was never
set up the way pyepics expects. That is why the ``libca-init-first`` phase, which
inverts only the binding order, is the whole mitigation.

The failure this produces depends on which libca pyepics loads, so the probe
pins the production one (see ``use_production_libca``).
