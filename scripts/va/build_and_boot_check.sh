# Validation gate for the full Virtual Accelerator image.
#
# Stages a minimal build context (pyproject.toml, README.md, src/,
# docker/virtual-accelerator/Containerfile -- never the repo root, which
# also contains .venv/.git/worktrees), builds the image, boots a container
# with the packaged control_assistant preset's data/simulation/ directory
# bind-mounted (a real machine.json, so the engine source has something to
# serve), waits for it to report ready, and then drives both served
# transports against it.
#
# Before asserting anything, the gate proves it is measuring its OWN container:
# every Channel Access step below runs from the host, and a host client is
# pointed at a PORT, not at a container. A second virtual accelerator holding
# that port serves the same channel names with the same quiescent zeros, so it
# would satisfy or fail these steps while this gate reported on a machine it
# never started. The identity handshake that runs before step 1 closes that.
#
# What the gate asserts, and why each assertion is not vacuous:
#
#   1. The readiness line matches its whole contract -- marker AND a
#      positive channel count -- rather than just the marker, so a boot that
#      served nothing could not satisfy it.
#   2. A Channel Access read of a quiescent BPM returns zero. This is the
#      BASELINE, deliberately not an assertion of correctness: the tutorial
#      lattice's closed orbit with no corrector excited IS exactly zero, so
#      a read here cannot distinguish a working physics chain from an
#      unseeded PV. That is why (3) exists.
#   3. Exciting a corrector moves the BPMs off zero. THIS is the assertion
#      with teeth: only a live manifest -> records -> physics-bridge ->
#      lattice chain can move a reading, and an unseeded PV stays at zero
#      through the write. The setpoint is written with put-completion, so
#      the read that follows cannot race the solve.
#   4. The runner's own control PV is ABSENT. The name is read out of the
#      serving stack's own constant in the container rather than hardcoded,
#      because an absence check only means something when the name is one the
#      server WOULD serve under the opposite configuration -- and the policy
#      flag is asserted alongside it, so the step knows which configuration it
#      is testing. Paired with a positive control on a known-good PV, so
#      "absent" cannot be satisfied by a server that stopped answering.
#      SNAPSHOT is checked too but is explicitly only a forward regression
#      guard: no such PV exists in this stack, so its absence is evidence of
#      nothing by itself.
#   5. A PVA get of model_info returns the model's real variable roster.
#   6. A PVA put above the drive limit lands CLAMPED, on both views of the
#      address -- the value is checked back over PVA and over CA.
#   7. A refused PVA put moves nothing. Checked on the Channel Access view,
#      because that is the view that carries a real reading; see the step
#      itself for why the PVA view would make this check vacuous today.
#   8. The PVAccess port is not published to the host, while PVA is
#      confirmed live inside the container -- so "unpublished" is
#      distinguished from "not running".
#
# Exits 0 only if the image builds, boots to serving PVs within
# BOOT_TIMEOUT_SECS, and every assertion above holds.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run. Removes any prior gate container first.
#
# Environment:
#   OSPREY_VA_CA_PORT   Channel Access port to bind and publish. Defaults to
#                       5164, deliberately NOT the 5064 the "Local Simulation"
#                       gateway preset and the compose template name: this gate
#                       binds and publishes whatever port it is given, so it
#                       needs no particular number, and staying off 5064 keeps
#                       it clear of the deployed stacks that do need that one.
#                       Set it to 5064 to certify on the shipped default, on a
#                       host where nothing else holds it.
