**An agentic interface to scientific control systems.**

Osprey addresses control-specific challenges: semantic addressing across large channel
namespaces, protocol-agnostic integration with control stacks, logbook search
across facility electronic logbooks, and mandatory human oversight for every hardware write.

Built for large scientific facilities, such as particle accelerators.

## Quick start

```bash
# Install the framework as a standalone CLI tool (using uv, recommended)
uv tool install osprey-framework

# Create a minimal deployment repo to verify your setup
osprey init quickstart --preset hello-world
cd quickstart

# init seeds .env from the provider keys your shell exports, and says so.
# When it reports none, copy the example and fill it in:
# cp .env.example .env

# Render the deployment, then open the web terminal
osprey build
osprey web
```

For a deployment tailored to your detector, beamline, or accelerator subsystem, install the
guided build-interview skill and run it from your agent session:

```bash
osprey skills install osprey-build-interview
```

Then start the agent in an empty directory and type `/osprey-build-interview`. The skill
walks you through a guided conversation and produces the deployment repository — a git
repository whose `profile.yml` is the source of truth. From inside it, `osprey build`
renders the ready-to-run deployment into `build/`.

## Key features

- **Agent-driven orchestration** — Skills, MCP tools, and explicit dependency declarations
  let the Osprey agent decompose operator requests into auditable steps with mandatory
  approval gates.
- **Control-system safety** — Pattern detection, channel boundary checking, and mandatory
  human approval for every hardware write.
- **Protocol-agnostic integration** — EPICS and Mock connectors ship in-tree; LabVIEW, Tango,
  and other stacks connect through the
  [connector interface](https://als-apg.github.io/osprey/how-to/add-connector.html).
- **Replaceable backends** — The agent harness, the underlying model, and the compute backend
  are each swappable by configuration, without changing what the operator sees.
- **Scalable capability management** — Dynamic classification prevents prompt explosion as
  toolsets grow.
