"""Supported helpers for serving a FastAPI interface on a throwaway port.

These utilities run any OSPREY interface ``create_app()`` on a free localhost
port in a background thread — the shared surface used by the real-browser
Playwright suites under ``tests/interfaces/`` *and* by the documentation
screenshot runner (``docs/screenshots/``). Both consumers import a real,
supported API here instead of reaching into test internals.

The module depends only on the standard library plus ``uvicorn``/``fastapi``
(both already core runtime dependencies); it pulls in no test-only packages, so
importing it from shipped code drags nothing extra along.
