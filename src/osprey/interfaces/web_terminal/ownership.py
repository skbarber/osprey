"""Where a Scaffold Gallery claim is durably recorded, and how it is read back.

A claim is a statement that an artifact is the operator's. That statement has
to be written somewhere it will still be true tomorrow, and where that is
depends entirely on what the gallery is running on top of:

* **Profile** — the project names a profile that this process can reach. The
  profile is the source of truth: ``osprey build`` copies its convention
  directories into the project and derives ``scaffold.user_owned`` from what it
  copied. Claims move the artifact there (``osprey scaffold claim``, callable as
  :func:`osprey.cli.scaffold_cmd.claim_into_profile`) and the gallery reads and
  saves the profile's copy from then on. Writing the project copy instead would
  be overwritten by the next ``osprey build``.

* **Volume** — a deployed web terminal. The project tree is baked into the
  image, so every write to it is destroyed on the next container recreation,
  and destroyed *silently*: the claim reports success, the gallery shows it as
  user-owned, and then it evaporates. The per-user ``claude-config`` volume is
  the only surface in that container that outlives the image, so ownership
  records and the claimed bodies both live there::

      $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/osprey/scaffold/
          user_owned.json        ownership records, keyed by canonical name
          files/<output_path>    the content each claim is a claim *of*

* **Degraded** — the project names a profile, that profile cannot be reached,
  and there is no volume either. Nothing here is durable, so a claim refuses
  with the same message ``osprey scaffold claim`` gives. Falling back to
  ``config.yml`` would make the gallery a back door around the single-writer
  contract: it would report success, and the next build would erase it.

* **Config** — the project names no profile at all (a pre-profile manifest).
  Ownership goes in ``config.yml``, which is what such a project has always
  used and, on a host, is at least durable.

The mode question is "can this process reach a durable source of truth", not
"am I in a container" — a container that bind-mounts its profile is in profile
mode, and gets it right for free.

The gallery *reads* the union of build-derived ownership (``config.yml``) and
the per-user store; :func:`merge_user_owned` states which wins.

Artifact names use the same vocabulary as ``scaffold.user_owned``: the full
path below the convention's destination, so a nested command is
``commands/osprey/scan``, never ``commands/scan``. Two spellings for one
artifact would make the union meaningless.
