    One derivation for both spawn sites — this module already owns the posture
    markers they share, and a second copy of the resolution is exactly how two
    sites come to disagree. It answers the SHARED root (never
    ``resolve_agent_data_root`` from the workspace module, which appends
    ``sessions/<OSPREY_SESSION_ID>``): the control-target state file and the
    session-posture store both span sessions, and a reader outside the
    session's environment could not reproduce a session-scoped path.

    The stamp exists because everything below the spawn re-derives this
    directory today — the controls server through config, the stdlib-only hooks
    through a repo-root guess and the literal ``var/agent_data`` — and those
    derivations disagree the moment a deployment moves ``agent_data.base_dir``.
    Handing the child the answer makes it authoritative for every one of them.

    A config load can fail transiently, and the pair must be stamped whole or
    not at all, so a failure falls back to the same place the posture store's
    own resolution does (``app.state.workspace_dir``, then the process CWD)
    rather than leaving the child a session key with no anchor. Every reader
    prefers this value, so writer and readers stay on ONE directory even when
    it is the fallback one.

    Args:
        app: The FastAPI app, consulted only for the fallback. Optional: the
            primary resolution reads config and needs nothing from the server.

    """Build the environment for an SDK-backed operator or chat session.

    Both surfaces that run an :class:`OperatorSession` — the ``/ws/operator``
    websocket and the ``POST /api/chat`` endpoint — call this instead of
    :func:`~osprey.agent_runner.clean_env.build_clean_env` directly, so the two
    cannot drift on what the agent child is allowed to hold.

    On top of the clean base it re-adds exactly one credential: the **panel
    token**. That is deliberate re-introduction, the SDK counterpart of what
    :func:`osprey.cli.chat_cmd.chat` does for the PTY-less ``osprey chat``
    child and what
    :func:`osprey.interfaces.web_terminal.routes.websocket._build_extra_env`
    does for the PTY child. The token is the weak, panel-tier-only credential
    (see :data:`osprey.interfaces.web_auth.PANEL_TIER_ROUTES`); without it the
    MCP panel tools and the SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit/approval hooks the
    agent spawns send no bearer at all and are answered 401, which is how the
    panel tier came to be dead on the default ``osprey web`` launch.

    The **operator secret** is emphatically not re-added, and nothing here
    reads it. Note what that means on this path: the SDK builds the child's
    environment as ``{**os.environ, **options.env}``, so a name this function
    omits is inherited from ``os.environ`` anyway — the operator secret is kept
    from the child by :func:`osprey.interfaces.web_auth.close_env_carriers`
    having removed it from ``os.environ`` at app construction, not by its
    absence here.

    It does **not** carry the session's write posture into the child: that
    posture is per control target, lives in the posture store, and is read
    live at every write-time gate, so a narrowing applies to a chat already
    mid-conversation. A deployment-wide readonly marker still reaches the
    child exactly as it always has, through ``build_clean_env``'s copy of
    ``os.environ``; nothing here sets or removes one.

    What it stamps instead is the **audit pair** that tells the child where to
    read that store: ``OSPREY_POSTURE_SOURCE`` (this call site's
    *posture_source*) and ``OSPREY_POSTURE_SESSION`` (*session_key*). Two rules
    matter:

    * The pair is set **unconditionally** whenever there is a session key —
      a ``writes`` session exports both markers, as does a key the store has
      never held. They say *which* key a reader must look up and *who*
      spawned the child, and a session that was checked and came back
      ``writes`` is a different audit fact from one nobody ever asked about.
    * ``posture_source`` is passed in, never worked out here. It cannot be
      derived from the posture: ``writes`` and never-stored are the same
      value, and the source is a property of the *call site*, not of the
      answer the store gave. Every in-tree caller names it explicitly.

    Stamped in the same breath, and for the same reason it must not be stamped
    separately, is :data:`~osprey.audit.posture.OSPREY_AGENT_DATA_ROOT` —
    :func:`resolve_agent_data_root`'s answer. A session key tells a reader
    *whose* posture applies; the root tells it which directory holds the
    answer. The two are one fact split in half, so they are set together or
    not at all, and a test pins that.

    Keeping the stamps here — instead of handing each call site a rule to
    compose — is what stops the two SDK surfaces drifting on what a child is
    told about its own posture, which is the same reason this function exists
    at all.

    Args:
        project_cwd: The project directory the session runs in, forwarded to
            :func:`~osprey.agent_runner.clean_env.build_clean_env` so
            ``OSPREY_CONFIG`` is resolved from it.
        session_key: The identity this session is pooled under — the chat
            pool's ``chat_id`` for ``POST /api/chat``, the minted
            ``operator-<hex8>`` key for ``/ws/operator``. It is the key the
            posture store is read under. Omitted, the child gets the render's
            baseline environment and no marker is added — nothing names a
            session for a reader to look up.
        app: The FastAPI app whose agent-data root the child is pointed at
            (:func:`resolve_agent_data_root`). Stamped alongside *session_key*;
            without an app the root falls back to the deployment derivation.
        posture_source: Which surface is spawning this child, from
            :data:`_POSTURE_SOURCES`. ``POST /api/chat`` passes
            :data:`POSTURE_SOURCE_LIVE` for a ``chat_id`` the posture surface
            can address, and ``process`` for one it cannot (a caller-chosen id
            outside the bare-UUID grammar, which no store will ever answer
            for); ``/ws/operator``
            passes :data:`POSTURE_SOURCE_SPAWN` (its ``operator-<hex8>`` key is
            minted per connection and the posture route, which requires a
            session UUID, can never address it). Defaults to ``live``, the
            shape of a key the store keeps answering for — but every call site
            in this tree states its own, and a test pins that.

    Returns:
        A fresh env dict for ``ClaudeAgentOptions.env``.
