"""Scaffold gallery routes.

The two refusals that most of these routes share — a claim the profile will
not take, and an ownership store that will not take the write — are translated
into 409s by app-level handlers (see
:func:`~osprey.interfaces.web_terminal.app.register_scaffold_conflict_handlers`),
so they are deliberately not caught here. What each route does catch is the
translation that is specific to it.
