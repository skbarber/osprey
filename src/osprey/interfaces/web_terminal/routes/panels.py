            "open_tiles_dock": bool|None,     # reporting client had a dock shell (None = never)
        }

    ``project_key`` is an opaque, stable per-project identifier (16 hex chars,
    a truncated sha256 of the resolved project directory). The client uses it as
    the ``osprey-dock-layout-<project_key>`` localStorage suffix so dock layouts
    persist independently per project on a shared browser origin.

    ``ui_mode`` mirrors the server-rendered ``<html data-ui-mode>`` attribute so
    the client can read the resolved mode after boot. First paint must never
    depend on this field — the SSR attribute is the authoritative first-paint
    rung; this is the API-side echo for later client mode resolution.

    ``rail_position`` mirrors the server-rendered ``<html data-rail-position>``
    the same way, and travels with two companions: ``family_rail_defaults``
    (``app.FAMILY_RAIL_DEFAULTS``, the theme-family -> rail-position coupling
    that gives the retro family a top tab strip) and
    ``rail_position_configured`` (whether ``web.rail_position`` was set
    explicitly, which outranks that coupling). ``rail-position.js`` reads both
    so a live theme-family switch can move the rail without the browser
    carrying its own copy of the coupling.

    ``presets`` is the config-defined "Layouts" list (``web.presets``), resolved
    at startup against the live panel set and carried in config order. It is
    empty unless a deployment opts in, so the "+" popover renders unchanged by
    default. Each entry is ``{"name": <label>, "panels": [<member id>, ...]}``.

    ``allow_runtime_panels`` mirrors the config gate the ``POST /api/panels/register``
    route enforces, so the frontend can show or hide the "new panel from URL" input
    without first attempting a registration that would 403.

    ``default`` is not validated here — the frontend falls back to
    ``DEFAULT_PANEL_FALLBACK`` when it is unknown so a typo doesn't leave the
    user staring at a blank tabset.

    ``active`` mirrors ``GET /api/panel-focus`` so the agent can read back the
    full panel state in a single round-trip.

    ``labels`` covers only the enabled built-in panels; custom panels carry
    their own ``label`` field in the ``custom`` list.

    ``workspace_has_artifacts`` reports whether the agent workspace already
    holds any (non-hidden) file. The simple UX uses it to decide whether the
    first paint is chat-only (empty workspace) or includes the WORKSPACE
    panel; recomputed per request so a reload after the first artifact lands
    sees ``true``.

    ``open_tiles`` is what a browser last reported through
    ``POST /api/panel-layout``: the service tiles actually on screen, in spatial
    reading order. It is distinct from ``visible`` — that is launcher-rail
    membership, this is occupancy. ``open_tiles_age_s`` is the seconds elapsed
    since the occupancy last *changed* (a deduped repeat report does not reset
    it) and ``open_tiles_dock`` is whether the reporting client had a dock
    shell.

    Read together, the three fields carry three distinct states, and a
    consumer must not collapse them:

    - **Never reported** — all three ``null``. No client has ever checked in;
      nothing is known about the screen. Not the same as an empty workspace.
    - **Unknown occupancy** — ``open_tiles: null`` with a numeric
      ``open_tiles_age_s`` and ``open_tiles_dock: false``. A client is watching
      but runs without the dock shell, so it cannot report tile order.
    - **Known occupancy** — ``open_tiles`` is a list (possibly ``[]``, meaning
      the operator genuinely closed every service tile) with a numeric age and
      ``open_tiles_dock: true``.

    So ``[]`` always means known-empty and ``null`` always means unknown; the
    age tells the two flavours of unknown apart.

    Attribution decides the frame's fate. An ``source: "agent"`` switch is a
    command every client must apply, so it broadcasts. A source-less POST is a
    human gesture REPORT (panel-commands.js's ``setPanelFocus``): the server
    mirrors ``active_panel`` for the agent's gaze and broadcasts nothing —
    one operator's tab switches never move another client's workspace, and
    the gesturing client applies its own focus locally rather than riding an
    echo.

    ``body.url`` (e.g. from an agent-invoked ``open_panel`` MCP call) is
    run through ``_prefix_path()`` before broadcast so a root-absolute path
    lands inside the user's own mount; an already-absolute URL is left
    untouched.

    An **agent** focus on a panel that is **not** in the launcher rail also
    adds it there, emitting a ``panel_visibility`` frame *before* the focus
    frame. An agent's ``open_panel`` may name a panel the operator took off
    the rail; without the membership update the rail entry would exist only on
    the client that happened to apply the focus, so ``list_panels`` would keep
    reporting the panel invisible, a reload would drop both the entry and the
    agent-opened tile, and a late-connecting client would never see it at all.
    Ordering is deliberate: clients add the rail entry, then apply focus to it.

    A panel already in the rail — which is the only kind a human can click —
    changes nothing and emits no visibility frame. A **source-less** focus on
    a non-member is dropped whole: a human can only gesture at a panel already
    on the rail, so such a report is always a fire-and-forget straggler that a
    concurrent arrange overtook, and applying it would resurrect the panel the
    arrange just pruned.

    An agent switch is also mirrored into the activity history ring as one

    Declarative end state: exactly the resolved tiles are open, left to right,
    in the order given. Clients apply it as a deterministic rebuild of the
    service-tile region; the terminal tile is never touched.

    Exactly one of ``tiles`` and ``preset`` must be supplied. ``preset`` names
    an entry of ``web.presets`` (``app.state.panel_presets``); its members are
    resolved here so the human "Layouts" click and an agent preset call are one
    server operation. A preset additionally sets ``prune_rail`` on the
    broadcast, giving presets membership-exclusive semantics
    (non-members leave the launcher rail); a ``tiles`` request never removes
    rail membership, it only adds any listed non-member.

    Focus caveat: the server records the *requested* focus in
    ``app.state.active_panel`` and passes it through the broadcast unchanged.
    Panel health is only observable in the browser, so clients apply the
    healthy-fallback rule (requested panel if healthy, else the first healthy
    listed tile, else no focus change). A read-back of ``active`` therefore
    reports what was asked for, which may differ from what a client could
    actually focus.

    With no ``focus`` given — every human "Layouts" click, and any agent
    arrangement that does not name one — the first resolved tile is recorded
    instead. An arrangement always lands focus somewhere, and ``tiles[0]`` is
    what the client's healthy-fallback rule picks in the common case. Leaving
    ``active_panel`` untouched would strand it on a panel the arrangement just
    closed, so a preset click could leave ``active`` naming a panel that the
    very same ``GET /api/panels`` response omits from ``visible``. The
    broadcast still carries ``focus`` only when one was requested, leaving the
    client's fallback rule in charge of what is actually focused on screen.

    An agent arrangement is mirrored into the activity history ring as a single
    ``arrange_workspace`` row targeting the recorded focus panel.

    Args:

    This is the reporter's endpoint, not a command: it is how the browser tells
    the server what the operator's workspace actually looks like, so the agent
    stops guessing tile occupancy from rail membership. Nothing is broadcast —
    a human's tile gestures are never pushed to other clients (report-only,
    last-writer-wins), and reports are agent-facing state only.

    ``tiles`` is the service-tile list in spatial reading order (rows
    top-then-left); the terminal tile is never part of it. An empty list is a
    valid report from a dock client — it means the operator closed every
    service tile.

    ``dock`` is the reporting client's capability flag, and it decides how the
    report is *recorded*. A client running without the dock shell cannot see
    tile order, so the ``{"tiles": [], "dock": false}`` it sends is a presence
    signal, not an observation of an empty workspace. Recording that ``[]``
    verbatim would let a fallback client clobber a dock client's live list with
    a confident "nothing is open". So ``dock: false`` stores occupancy as
    **unknown** (``open_tiles = None``) while still stamping the timestamp and
    the flag — ``GET /api/panels`` then reports ``open_tiles: null`` with a
    numeric age, meaning "a client is watching but cannot report tile order".
    The mapping happens here, not on the wire. ``dock: true`` records the list
    verbatim.

    Content dedupe: a report whose *recorded* occupancy and ``dock`` flag both
    equal the stored state is a no-op — the stored timestamp is deliberately
    *not* bumped, so ``open_tiles_age_s`` keeps measuring when the layout last
    **changed**. This is the server half of the convergence contract: the
    client also skips posting a report equal to its last acknowledged one, so
    an applied arrangement settles after at most one extra round-trip instead
    of looping. Two successive dock-less reports therefore dedupe against each
    other, since both record the same unknown occupancy.
