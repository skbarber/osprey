"""Feedback submission routes.

Two endpoints, one composer:

* ``POST /api/feedback`` writes one record on this deployment and returns the
  finished clipboard payload. Every channel writes a record — a GitHub or email
  submission leaves the same paper trail a Local one does, which is what makes
  ``osprey feedback list`` the complete submission history.
* ``POST /api/feedback/bundle`` renders the session context alone for the
  standalone Copy button and writes nothing.

Three things about these handlers are deliberate and easy to undo by accident:

* **They are sync ``def``, not ``async def``.** FastAPI runs a sync handler in
  the threadpool. Composing reads the session transcript, which fans out into
  every subagent file (``1 + N`` reads), and the event loop these routes share
  is the same one that pumps the PTY WebSocket — a blocking read on it stalls
  everyone's terminal.
* **The session id is validated before any transcript path is built.** It is
  client-supplied and lands in ``transcript_dir / f"{session_id}.jsonl"``
  unsanitised, so a non-UUID is refused with 422 up front.
* **Identity is taken from the server, never from the request body.** A report
  says who filed it because the deployment knows, not because the browser
  claimed it.

worth stating rather than smoothing over:

* nginx weighs the **raw HTTP body**, which is strictly larger than what is
  counted here (JSON framing, escapes, the other fields).
* This check weighs the **decoded fields that reach disk**, and only those:
  a send that leaves the context box unticked carries no scrollback to count.
* Starlette has already buffered and parsed the whole body by the time a
  handler runs, so this bounds the *record*, not the process's peak memory.

The skew runs in the safe direction: in a multi-user deployment nginx is the
stricter, binding constraint and refuses the request before OSPREY sees it.

all, and without it the same client could spool an unbounded record there and
