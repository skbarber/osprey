    document would have changed. One refusal path, so the two cannot drift into
    telling an operator different stories about the same rule, and one query
    across ``var/audit/*/http_config.jsonl`` still finds every refusal either
    produced, per identity.

    The machine-readable parts stay ``setup_patch``'s to the letter -- the same
    ``reason``, the same ``surface``, the same ``BLOCKED a protected config key``
    phrase in the feed -- so one query still spans every surface. Only the
    human sentence is wider than ``setup_patch``'s: that tool takes a key list
    and can honestly say a key may not be *set*, while a whole-document PUT can
    also delete one or reshape the block around it, and a refusal that named
    only setting would misdescribe two of the three.

    Ordering is ``setup_patch``'s, for the same reason: the durable record is
    written before the activity frame, so a refusal survives even when the feed
    is unreachable. Both reporting steps are guarded and the refusal itself sits
    outside the guards -- reporting is best-effort, refusing is not. An

    could mistake for a gate that failed open.

    The Raw YAML view's write path: it replaces the whole document verbatim,
    comments and all. That makes it the widest write surface onto the file that
    carries the write gate, the approval gate, the agent's rendered permission
    surface and the paths the safety layers derive their allow and deny areas
    from -- and the only one that could change any of them without naming them,
    simply by handing over different bytes. So it is gated the way PATCH is, by
    the same protected set and with the same refusal, but on a document diff
    rather than a key list: the replacement must leave every protected key
    exactly as it found it. See :func:`_changed_protected_keys` for what that
    comparison catches and why it is done on segment tuples.

    The check sits between the parse and the *first* thing that touches disk --
    ahead of the backup, which is itself a write derived from a file this
    request may turn out not to be allowed to replace.

    An edit that touches only unprotected keys goes through untouched, and still
    re-renders the ``.claude/`` artifacts through :func:`_regen_after_write`. That
    matters more here than it reads: since the protected set took the render's
    inputs away from PATCH, this is the only surface left whose writes can move
    a rendered artifact at all.

    Note:
        One residual is known and deliberate. For a protected pattern that is
        *not* a trailing-wildcard family -- ``config.yml`` has three:
        ``artifacts.hooks``, ``simulation.state_dir`` and the channel-finder
        ``...feedback.store_path`` -- the flatten descends past the pattern's
        depth when the node there is a mapping, and the children come back
        unprotected. ``artifacts.hooks`` is covered anyway by the ``artifacts.*``
        family beside it. The other two both name a *path*, and neither can be
        made to point somewhere by planting a block there -- but for different
        reasons, and the difference is worth stating because only one of them is
        the tidy one:

        * ``simulation.state_dir`` is read through ``dotted_config_str``, which
          answers ``None`` for anything that is not a non-empty string. A block
          there reads as unset, so the runtime takes its default.
        * ``...feedback.store_path`` is read *raw* --
          ``server_context.py`` does ``feedback_config["store_path"]`` behind a
          truthiness guard that a non-empty mapping passes. It reaches
          ``resolve_cf_state_path``, ``Path(dict)`` raises ``TypeError``, and the
          ``except Exception`` around the initialization swallows it. The
          feedback store is therefore left *disabled*, not defaulted.

        Both outcomes are inert for this gate's purpose -- neither repoints a
        write at an attacker-named location, which is what the key is protected
        for -- and the second is a degradation of an optional store, logged at
        warning level. Neither ratchets, either: every transition that would put
        a real value back (mapping to scalar, absent to scalar) makes the
        protected leaf appear, which this diff refuses. Sealing such a node as a
        whole value cannot be done here without over-refusing: through the
        public matcher a node like ``services`` is indistinguishable from a
        genuine exact-depth key, being protected only as an *ancestor* of one,
        and sealing it would refuse every unprotected edit under ``services.*``.
        ``test_put_protected_families_are_descent_safe_or_known_inert`` is the
        tripwire: it fails if a fourth exact-depth pattern is ever added, so the
        judgement is re-made rather than inherited.
