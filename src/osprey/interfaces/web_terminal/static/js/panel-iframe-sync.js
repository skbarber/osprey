/* OSPREY Web Terminal — Panel Iframe State Sync
 *
 * The per-iframe "push host state into a panel" seam: theme, active session,
 * and UI mode, each serialized to a panel iframe via postMessage. Extracted
 * from panel-manager so that module stays focused on panel lifecycle, rail
 * rendering, and health — these three helpers share one shape (take an
 * iframe, guard its contentWindow, swallow the cross-origin throw) and one
 * concern (host → follower messaging), and depend on none of panel-manager's
 * private panel state, so they live cleanly on their own.
 *
 * The hub-role fan-outs that iterate every panel (theme-manager's own theme
 * broadcast; panel-manager's broadcastMode) stay with their owners — this
 * module is only the single-iframe trigger points (iframe creation and tab
 * activation) those fan-outs and panel-manager call into.
