"""Read-only GET proxy onto the Bluesky bridge for the bluesky-web sidecar.

This module defines ``router`` only; ``osprey.interfaces.bluesky_web.app``
mounts it and publishes the shared ``httpx.AsyncClient`` and resolved bridge
base URL onto ``app.state.client`` / ``app.state.bridge_url``, which every
route here reads at request time.

Every route here is a thin, verbatim passthrough: the bridge's JSON body and
HTTP status code (including 404/409 error shapes) are relayed unchanged --
nothing here recomputes ``row_count``/``truncated``/``partial`` or any other
bridge-owned field. This mirrors the read side of the bridge contract at
``osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.app``:

- ``GET /bridge/health`` -> the bridge's ``GET /health``
- ``GET /plans``
- ``GET /plans/{name}/source``
- ``GET /runs`` (``limit`` query param)
- ``GET /runs/{run_id}``
- ``GET /runs/{run_id}/data`` (``max_rows``/``offset``/``tail`` query params)
- ``GET /runs/{run_id}/figure`` (no query params)

Every path mirrors the bridge's own except the first: the sidecar serves its
OWN ``GET /health`` (its container healthcheck, in
``osprey.interfaces.bluesky_web.app``), so the bridge's health document --
which carries the ``capability`` record panels read to decide whether to offer
execution at all -- is relayed one level down at ``/bridge/health`` rather than
shadowing it. The body is still passed through untouched.

No write verbs are exposed here (no ``POST /runs``, no ``/launch``, no
``/stop``) -- this router is GET-only by construction.

A connection-level failure to reach the bridge (refused connection, DNS
failure, timeout, ...) is translated into a 502 with a fixed detail body,
mirroring the error-translation spirit of
``osprey.mcp_server.bluesky.server_context._http_get_json``'s
``bluesky_bridge_unreachable`` handling -- it never surfaces here as an
uncaught 500. HTTP-level error responses from the bridge itself (404, 409,
...) are not exceptions to httpx at all; they flow straight through and are
relayed as-is.

Responses only ever carry the bridge's own body content and prefix-relative
paths (path params/query params passed through verbatim) -- no absolute URLs
are ever emitted, since panels consume these prefix-relative.
