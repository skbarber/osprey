"""The bluesky-web sidecar's FastAPI app: the operator panel bundles plus a
shared HTTP client onto the Bluesky bridge.

What the app owns is serving and plumbing: its container healthcheck, a default
no-cache header on everything that does not set one itself, one
``httpx.AsyncClient`` and resolved
bridge URL published on ``app.state`` for every router to use, and the mounts
for the panel bundles plus the shared design-system assets. Each bundle is
served verbatim except its ``index.html``, which is rendered so ``vendor_url()``
can resolve highlight.js to the CDN or to a locally fetched copy.

What it does NOT own is policy. The bridge-facing routers it composes — the read
proxy, the plan-draft relay and the plan-queue relay — relay to the bridge
verbatim, body and status code alike; the bridge decides what a request is
allowed to do. The one router that reaches no bridge is the channel catalog,
which serves the build-time ``channels.json`` mounted beside the config.

Panel mounts (panel bundles must agree with this mapping — see
``_PANEL_MOUNTS`` below):

- ``_BLUESKY_PANEL_DIR`` (bundle) -> ``/bluesky``

Stays import-clean of ``bluesky``/``ophyd``/``tiled`` at module scope, mirroring
``osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.app``.
