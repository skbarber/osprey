The three bridge-facing routers (``read_proxy``, ``draft_relay``, ``launch``)
each translate a connection-level bridge failure into the same 502 body and
each parse a bridge response body defensively. Both were inlined per module;
this leaf keeps the one constant and the one safe-parse helper so the routers
stay in agreement.
