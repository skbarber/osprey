/**
 * BLUESKY panel — the shell.
 *
 * One panel, three views: Plans (compose a plan), Queue (what the queue server
 * is holding) and Results (the selected run's record, table and trace). This
 * module owns only what is common to all three — which one is showing, the
 * run the Results view is following, the tile-bar contribution, and the fan-out
 * of the hub's Expert/Simple flips. Each view is a factory that takes the panel
 * root and its callbacks; nothing here reaches into a view's internals.
 *
 * TWO tab strips, deliberately, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 * - The panel describes the three views to the web-terminal hub as a `nav`
 *   contribution, so an embedded panel gets ONE header (the tile bar) rather
 *   than a bar under a bar.
 * - The panel ALSO renders its own strip in the body. `contributeHeader` is a
 *   strict no-op standalone, and the hub collapses a service tile's bar to
 *   zero height in Simple mode — in both cases the contributed strip does not
 *   exist, and the panel would be unnavigable without its own. The in-body
 *   strip is therefore hidden by CSS in exactly one case: embedded AND Expert.
 *
 * - No `innerHTML`, anywhere. Plan names, parameter values, and refusal
 *   sentences all originate off-panel (an agent's draft, the bridge, another
 *   operator), and they reach the DOM only as text nodes. Row identity travels
 *   in `data-*` attributes read by delegated listeners, never interpolated
 *   into markup.
 * - No local copy of the bridge's arming policy. The panel never decides
 *   whether a deployment may execute; it asks, and when the bridge refuses it
 *   shows the bridge's own sentence VERBATIM — that sentence carries the
 *   remedy (which token is missing, or the `osprey set connector=…` flip
 *   command for a browse-only deployment).
 *
 * The persistent status strip (queue state, "Stop after current item", "Abort
 * running plan") is NEVER contributed, for the same reason read in reverse:
 * anything safety-bearing has to survive Simple mode, and the tile bar does
 * not. It renders in the body on every tab — see index.html.
 *
