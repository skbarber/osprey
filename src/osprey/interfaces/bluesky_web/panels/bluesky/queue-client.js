/**
 * BLUESKY panel — queue logic.
 *
 * Everything in this module is pure (or, for `createQueueStream`, injectable):
 * the reducers that turn the bridge's SSE frames into panel state, the
 * predicates that decide which queue control is live, the refusal classifier,
 * and the progress formatter. `queue-view.js` owns every DOM node; this module owns
 * every decision, so the wire contract is unit-testable with plain objects.
 *
 * Wire shapes this module speaks (bridge `queue.py`, relayed verbatim by the
 * sidecar's `queue_relay.py`):
 *
 * - `GET /queue/events` frames: `{type: "hello"|"queue", status, items,
 *   running_item}` — FULL snapshots, never diffs, so a frame replaces state
 *   rather than patching it.
 * - `status` is the manager's bounded summary: `{available, manager_state,
 *   items_in_queue, items_in_history, running_item_uid, plan_queue_uid,
 *   plan_history_uid, queue_stop_pending, queue_autostart_enabled, ...}`, or
 *   `{available: false, reason}` when the manager could not be read at all.
 * - `items` are the manager's own item documents (`item_uid`, `name`,
 *   `kwargs`, `meta.osprey_run_id`); the running item may carry `progress`.
 *
 * Refusals are the one shape worth stating twice: the queue relay does NOT
 * unwrap the bridge's envelope, so the discriminator is `detail.code` and the
 * operator-facing sentence is `detail.detail`. A panel reading a TOP-LEVEL
 * `code` finds nothing and silently mis-classifies every refusal — see
 * `classifyQueueRefusal`.
