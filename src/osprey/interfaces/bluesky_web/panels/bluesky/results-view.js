/**
 * BLUESKY panel — the Results view.
 *
 * Follows ONE run through three reads per tick, all on the sidecar's read
 * proxy: `GET /runs/{id}` for its record, `GET /runs/{id}/data` for a bounded
 * rows/columns window, and `GET /runs/{id}/figure` for the plan's own view of
 * itself. The first two feed the raw table; the third is handed to
 * `figure-renderer.js` to draw. Read only — nothing in this file issues a
 * write verb.
 *
 * The FIGURE leads and the table follows, collapsed. A run's figure is the
 * plan's own answer to what the run meant; the table is the raw material behind
 * it, and it can be thousands of rows. So the table renders inside a `<details>`
 * that ships closed, and the view never touches its `open` state after that —
 * an operator stepping through runs comparing rows keeps it open for as long as
 * they want it, because nothing here closes it again.
 *
 * That makes the table a PREVIEW, and it is labelled as one. `/data` serves at
 * most `max_rows` (100 by default) while reporting the run's true `row_count`
 * separately, so a truncated window says how much it is withholding and points
 * at the export. The export is the other half: it re-reads `/data` with
 * `max_rows` set to the full count and writes a CSV through `csv-export.js`.
 * If even that comes back short — `live_rows` caps stored rows per run — the
 * file still saves and the note says exactly how short, because a partial
 * export presented as complete is the one outcome worth preventing.
 *
 * Cadence: ~1 s while the run is non-terminal or either the data or the figure
 * still reports `partial: true`; polling stops once the run is terminal and
 * both halves are settled, so a finished run costs nothing.
 *
 * Two shapes of "gone" are distinguished, because they mean opposite things:
 * `GET /runs/{id}` 404s once the manager has rotated the run out of its
 * history, while `/data` and `/figure` keep serving it from Tiled long
 * afterwards. A record 404 therefore does NOT clear the results — the data is
 * shown with a note, because the durable record is the one an operator came
 * for.
 *
 * A figure that carries a `reason` is a DEFAULT view, not an error: the bridge
 * could not run the plan's own `render()` and fell back to plotting the raw
 * columns. It is drawn like any other, and the renderer's note line says why.
 * A transient figure fetch failure keeps the last good figure on screen rather
 * than blanking it, exactly as the table does with its last good rows.
 *
 * Colors live in the renderer, which re-reads the theme bridges on every call;
 * this file re-renders the retained figure from a `subscribe()` callback so a
 * settled run re-themes without waiting for a poll tick that will never come.
