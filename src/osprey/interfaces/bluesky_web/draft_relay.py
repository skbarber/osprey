"""Sidecar passthrough relay for the Bluesky bridge's plan-draft endpoints.

This module only defines
``router``; ``osprey.interfaces.bluesky_web.app`` mounts it alongside
``read_proxy``/``launch``/``health``, so every route here reads the shared
``httpx.AsyncClient`` and resolved bridge base URL from ``request.app.state``
at request time (set in the app's lifespan) -- exactly the ``read_proxy``
pattern.

Every ``/draft`` route (GET/PATCH/DELETE) is a thin, verbatim passthrough of
the bridge's JSON body and HTTP status code -- including 4xx bodies such as a
409 ``no_draft``/``expected_plan_name`` mismatch or a 422 per-field
validation error -- mirroring ``read_proxy``'s passthrough convention
(nothing here recomputes or reinterprets a bridge-owned field). A PATCH
request's JSON body is forwarded to the bridge unchanged.

``GET /draft/events`` relays the bridge's Server-Sent-Events stream to the
browser -- the browser never talks to the bridge directly, only this sidecar
does. This mirrors the SSE hop in
``osprey.interfaces.web_terminal.routes.proxy.proxy_panel``:
``client.build_request(...)`` + ``client.send(req, stream=True)`` with a
per-request ``httpx.Timeout(None, connect=5.0)`` override, since the shared
client's 15s default read timeout would kill the connection during the
bridge's ~15s heartbeat-interval idle periods.

A connection-level failure to reach the bridge (refused connection, DNS
failure, timeout, ...) is translated into a 502 with the same fixed detail
body ``read_proxy`` uses for its own bridge-unreachable case -- it never
surfaces here as an uncaught 500. HTTP-level error responses from the bridge
itself (404, 409, 422, ...) are not exceptions to httpx at all; they flow
straight through and are relayed as-is.
