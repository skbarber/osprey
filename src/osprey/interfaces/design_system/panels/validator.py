"""Fail-closed static validation for a **panel** directory.

A *panel* is a directory bundling an HTML entry point plus a
``manifest.json`` — the self-contained mini-app the web terminal mounts
alongside the chat surface. Where ``manifest.py`` validates only the JSON
descriptor's *schema*, this module validates the whole **directory**: it
runs the cheap, decidable static checks that decide whether a panel is a
well-formed, theme-aware surface before anything tries to serve it.

The checks are deliberately limited to what is decidable from the source
alone (this is why they are cheap and never flake):

1. **Manifest present + schema-valid.** ``manifest.json`` must exist in
   the panel dir and pass ``manifest.py``'s :func:`validate_manifest`;
   every :class:`~.manifest.ManifestFinding` is folded into this module's
   own error type. The manifest's declared ``entry`` file must also
   actually exist on disk (a filesystem fact the schema validator, being
   pure, cannot check).
2. **Design-system linked.** The entry HTML must opt into shared theming
   the way every standalone surface does — by referencing the pre-paint
   boot script *and* the token stylesheet: a
   ``<script src="/design-system/js/theme-boot.js">`` and a
   ``<link ... href="/design-system/css/tokens.css">`` (see the reference
   head in ``osprey.interfaces.artifacts.app``). Missing either is an
   error.
3. **Token-only (no raw hex colors).** The panel's HTML/CSS/JS must style
   through ``var(--…)`` design tokens, never raw ``#rgb``/``#rrggbb``
   color literals. Each hex-color-shaped literal is flagged with its file
   and line (see :data:`_HEX_COLOR_PATTERN` for exactly what counts as a
   color shape, and the false-positive caveat documented there).

This module deliberately does **not** attempt to prove a panel honors the
runtime ``?theme=`` query parameter — that is undecidable statically and
belongs to the separate runtime/browser check. Everything here is
decidable, and every check *fails closed*: :func:`assert_valid_panel`
raises a bundled :class:`PanelValidationError` if *any* check fails; no
check is weakened to let a panel pass.

The idiom is the design system's shared fail-closed one
(``design_system/errors.py``, also used by ``generator/validate.py`` and
the sibling ``panels/manifest.py``): a :class:`StrEnum` of
machine-readable rule ids, a frozen :class:`PanelFinding` record rendering
``"{source}: {message}"`` (a finding, not a throwable — see that module's
naming rule), a :class:`PanelValidationError` bundling *every* finding,
and a :func:`validate_panel` that runs every check
without short-circuiting so a caller sees the complete set in one pass.

Stdlib-only (``json``, ``re``, ``dataclasses``, ``enum``, ``pathlib``,
``typing``).

#: digits (the CSS ``#rgb``/``#rgba``/``#rrggbb``/``#rrggbbaa`` shapes),
#: mirroring ``generator/validate.py``'s ``_SHORT_OR_FULL_HEX_PATTERN`` but
#: adapted from a whole-value ``^...$`` match to an embedded scan of raw
#: HTML/CSS/JS text:
#:
#: - The alternation is ordered longest-first and the trailing
#:   ``(?![0-9a-fA-F])`` forbids a following hex digit, so a wrong-length
#:   run like ``#12345`` (5 digits) matches nothing rather than being
#:   mis-read as ``#1234``/``#123`` — exactly the lengths ``validate.py``
#:   accepts as colors, and no others.
#: - The leading ``(?<![&\w])`` skips a ``#`` that is part of a word (so a
#:   ``#`` embedded in an identifier is ignored) and, crucially, a ``#``
#:   preceded by ``&`` — i.e. an HTML numeric character reference such as
#:   ``&#160;`` (nbsp) or ``&#8212;`` (em dash), whose digits are otherwise
#:   hex-shaped and would false-positive.
#:
#: Residual false-positive caveat: because this is a raw text scan (not the
#: type-scoped check ``validate.py`` can do over ``$type: "color"`` token
#: values), a URL *fragment* whose name happens to be all hex digits and
#: exactly 3/4/6/8 long — e.g. ``href="#abc"`` or ``href="#deadbeef"`` —
#: will be flagged as a color. Fragments with any non-hex character
#: (``href="#section"``, ``href="#top"``) are correctly ignored. This is an
#: accepted, fail-closed trade-off: the fix is to rename such a fragment (or
#: the author confirms it is genuinely not a color), never to loosen the
#: token-only rule.
