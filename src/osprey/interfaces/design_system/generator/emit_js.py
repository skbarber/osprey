"""Emit ``tokens.js`` and ``theme-boot.js`` from a validated DTCG :class:`~.model.TokenTree`.

Both outputs are theme-*registry* artifacts only: neither contains a single
color. Per the proposal's OC-2 decision (superseding an earlier draft of
the design spec's §3.3), the color-bearing exports once envisioned for
``tokens.js`` (``XTERM_PALETTES``, ``CHART_THEMES``, ``CHART_SERIES``,
``HLJS_THEMES``) do not exist here — ``theme-manager.js``'s computed-style
bridges (``xtermPalette()``/``chartTheme()``/``chartSeries()``) read
``--ansi-*``/``--chart-*`` custom properties out of ``tokens.css`` at
runtime instead, and the highlight.js stylesheet swap uses server-rendered
``data-href-dark/light`` attributes built from ``code.*`` via
``vendor_url()``. So the only thing either JS file needs from the token
tree is theme *identity* (id/label/mode) — never a resolved token value.

This module assumes ``tree`` has already passed
:func:`osprey.interfaces.design_system.generator.validate.assert_valid`:
it trusts ``tree.theme_metadata`` to have well-formed ``id``/``label``/
``mode`` strings for every theme and does not re-validate them.

Two artifacts:

- ``tokens.js`` — an ES module exporting ``THEMES`` (the ordered theme
  manifest, each entry carrying its declared ``family``), ``DEFAULTS``
  (a per-family ``{family: {mode: id}}`` map — which theme id ``auto``
  resolves to per OS color-scheme preference, grouped by
  ``$extensions.family`` so a family sharing a mode with another family
  can never hijack its default), and ``DEFAULT_FAMILY`` (the first family
  declared in the manifest — the single fallback ``theme-manager.js``
  reads instead of re-deriving it from ``DEFAULTS``; see
  :func:`_default_family`).
- ``theme-boot.js`` — a tiny classic (non-module) script, meant to be the
  first thing loaded in every ``<head>``, that applies ``data-theme``
  synchronously before first paint (the FOUC guard). It cannot ``import``
  ``tokens.js`` (module scripts are deferred, which would let the
  pre-theme flash it exists to prevent slip through), so it duplicates
  ``THEMES``'/``DEFAULTS``' data as inline literals baked from the same
  ``tree``.

Determinism rules mirror ``emit_css.py``: ``\\n`` line endings only, no
timestamps, deterministic ordering (manifest order = ``tree.theme_metadata``
iteration order, itself the sorted-by-filename order established by
``model.py`` — never re-sorted here), exactly one trailing newline, and no
trailing whitespace on any line.

#: path-scoped, so on such a deployment (every persona under ``/u/<user>/`` on
#: one origin) the bare :data:`STORAGE_KEY` is a single shared slot and the last
#: picker decides what everybody else boots into. When the attribute is present,
#: theme-boot.js reads ``osprey-theme--<scope>`` instead — and never falls back
#: to the bare key, which is precisely the polluted slot the scoping exists to
#: escape. When it is absent (single-user serving, and every other interface
#: that loads this script) the bare key is used unchanged.
#:
#: ``static/js/storage-scope.js`` is the written-down definition of this rule;
#: theme-boot.js is a pre-paint IIFE that cannot import it, so the generated

#: comments (both outputs are plain JS/ESM, so ``//`` works for either).
#: Wording matches ``emit_css.py``'s header verbatim (modulo comment
#: syntax) so all three generated files read as one family. No timestamp:

def render_theme_boot_js(tree: TokenTree) -> str:

    Resolution order, matching the design spec (finding I4): read
    ``?theme=``, then ``localStorage['osprey-theme']``, then the
    server-rendered ``<html data-theme>`` attribute; the first candidate
    that validates wins, and anything left over (missing or
    unrecognized) falls all the way through to ``'auto'``. ``'auto'``
    resolves via ``matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`` against
    ``DEFAULTS``. ``data-theme`` is set synchronously as the script's
    last statement, so it must be loaded as a blocking, non-module,
    non-deferred ``<script>`` first in ``<head>`` — no other script in
    this design system may run before it.

    The storage rung has two formats, read in the same order (and with
    the same acceptance rules) as ``theme-manager.js``'s
    ``_readStoredPreference``, because both read the *same* key:

    1. The current structured format ``{"family": ..., "mode": ...}``,
       which is what theme-manager persists. It is honored when the
       stored string parses as JSON, ``family`` is one of the baked
       ``DEFAULTS`` families, and ``mode`` is ``'dark'``, ``'light'`` or
       ``'auto'``; it resolves to ``DEFAULTS[family][mode]``, or — for
       ``'auto'`` — to that family's OS-preferred default. Without this
       rung a returning visitor's stored preference would be unreadable
       pre-paint and the page would flash the wrong theme before
       theme-manager caught up.
    2. The pre-family-model bare token (``'auto'`` or a concrete valid
       id), still written by older builds and still migrated forward by
       theme-manager. Reached only when the stored string is not
       structured JSON naming a known family and mode.

    The ``?theme=`` rung accepts only a bare token (``'auto'`` or a
    concrete valid id) — a URL carries a single value, never the
    structured pair.

    Both storage rungs are read under a PER-PERSONA key when the server
    stamped :data:`SCOPE_ATTRIBUTE` on ``<html>``: ``osprey-theme--<scope>``
    rather than the bare ``osprey-theme``, with no fallback to the bare key
    when the scoped one is missing. localStorage is origin-scoped, so on a
    multi-user mount the bare key is one slot shared by every persona and
    falling back to it would hand the last writer's theme to everyone who has
    not yet picked — the exact cross-persona bug the scoping closes. A scoped
    page with no scoped value simply has no stored preference, and resolution
    falls through to the server attribute and then to ``'auto'``. With the
    attribute absent (single-user serving, and every other interface that
    loads this script) both rungs read the bare key exactly as before, legacy
    bare token included. The stored VALUE shape is untouched by any of this.

    The emitted ``storageKey()`` inlines ``storage-scope.js``'s
    ``scopedStorageKey()`` rather than importing it — this script imports
    nothing — mirroring what the hand-written ``mode-boot.js`` does for the
    UI-mode axis.

    Server-attribute contract (for whoever renders ``<html>`` server-side,
    e.g. the web_terminal server): the boot script reads
    ``document.documentElement.getAttribute("data-theme")`` — i.e. the
    ``data-theme`` attribute on the ``<html>`` element. It is treated as a
    candidate only when it is a non-null string present in the baked
    ``VALID_IDS`` list (a concrete theme id the server resolved from
    config — never the literal ``"auto"``); anything else (missing
    attribute, unknown/stale id) is ignored and resolution falls through
    to the next rung. Critically, the script never unconditionally
    overwrites this attribute: the final ``setAttribute`` call only fires
    when the resolved id differs from what was already there, so a
    correctly server-rendered attribute causes neither a flash nor a
    redundant DOM write.

    ``DEFAULTS`` is the per-family ``{family: {mode: id}}`` map (see
    :func:`build_theme_defaults`). This script has no independent notion
    of "which family is active" — it derives the family ``auto`` should
    resolve within from ``FAMILY_BY_ID``, an ``{id: family}`` map baked
    from the same manifest: when the server ``data-theme`` attribute is a
    valid concrete id, that id's family wins (so ``auto`` stays inside the
    family the server already committed to, even if a literal ``"auto"``
    from ``?theme=``/``localStorage`` ends up being the actual candidate);
    otherwise ``DEFAULT_FAMILY`` — the first family declared in the
    manifest (manifest/filename order — never re-sorted) — is the
    deterministic fallback, reached only when no server attribute is
    present/valid (a host that does no server rendering, or omits it).
