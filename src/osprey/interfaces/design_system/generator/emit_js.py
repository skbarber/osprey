"""Emit ``tokens.js`` and ``theme-boot.js`` from a validated DTCG :class:`~.model.TokenTree`.

Both outputs are theme-*registry* artifacts only: neither contains a single
color. Per the proposal's OC-2 decision (superseding an earlier draft of
the design spec's §3.3), the color-bearing exports once envisioned for
``tokens.js`` (``XTERM_PALETTES``, ``CHART_THEMES``, ``CHART_SERIES``,
``HLJS_THEMES``) do not exist here — ``theme-manager.js``'s computed-style
bridges (``xtermPalette()``/``chartTheme()``/``chartSeries()``) read
``--ansi-*``/``--chart-*`` custom properties out of ``tokens.css`` at
runtime instead, and the highlight.js stylesheet swap uses server-rendered
``data-href-dark/light`` attributes built from ``code.*`` via
``vendor_url()``. So the only thing either JS file needs from the token
tree is theme *identity* (id/label/mode) — never a resolved token value.

This module assumes ``tree`` has already passed
:func:`osprey.interfaces.design_system.generator.validate.assert_valid`:
it trusts ``tree.theme_metadata`` to have well-formed ``id``/``label``/
``mode`` strings for every theme and does not re-validate them.

Two artifacts:

- ``tokens.js`` — an ES module exporting ``THEMES`` (the ordered theme
  manifest, each entry carrying its declared ``family``), ``DEFAULTS``
  (a per-family ``{family: {mode: id}}`` map — which theme id ``auto``
  resolves to per OS color-scheme preference, grouped by
  ``$extensions.family`` so a family sharing a mode with another family
  can never hijack its default), and ``DEFAULT_FAMILY`` (the first family
  declared in the manifest — the single fallback ``theme-manager.js``
  reads instead of re-deriving it from ``DEFAULTS``; see
  :func:`_default_family`).
- ``theme-boot.js`` — a tiny classic (non-module) script, meant to be the
  first thing loaded in every ``<head>``, that applies ``data-theme``
  synchronously before first paint (the FOUC guard). It cannot ``import``
  ``tokens.js`` (module scripts are deferred, which would let the
  pre-theme flash it exists to prevent slip through), so it duplicates
  ``THEMES``'/``DEFAULTS``' data as inline literals baked from the same
  ``tree``.

Determinism rules mirror ``emit_css.py``: ``\\n`` line endings only, no
timestamps, deterministic ordering (manifest order = ``tree.theme_metadata``
iteration order, itself the sorted-by-filename order established by
``model.py`` — never re-sorted here), exactly one trailing newline, and no
trailing whitespace on any line.

    Resolution order, matching the design spec (finding I4): read

    server-rendered ``<html data-theme>`` attribute, each validated
    against the baked-in id list (the query/storage rungs also accept the
    special ``'auto'`` value); the first candidate that validates wins,
    and anything left over (missing or unrecognized) falls all the way
    through to ``'auto'``. ``'auto'`` resolves via
    ``matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`` against ``DEFAULTS``.
    ``data-theme`` is set synchronously as the script's last statement, so
    it must be loaded as a blocking, non-module, non-deferred ``<script>``
    first in ``<head>`` — no other script in this design system may run
    before it.

    Server-attribute contract (for whoever renders ``<html>`` server-side,
    e.g. the web_terminal server): the boot script reads
    ``document.documentElement.getAttribute("data-theme")`` — i.e. the
    ``data-theme`` attribute on the ``<html>`` element. It is treated as a
    candidate only when it is a non-null string present in the baked
    ``VALID_IDS`` list (a concrete theme id the server resolved from
    config — never the literal ``"auto"``); anything else (missing
    attribute, unknown/stale id) is ignored and resolution falls through
    to the next rung. Critically, the script never unconditionally
    overwrites this attribute: the final ``setAttribute`` call only fires
    when the resolved id differs from what was already there, so a
    correctly server-rendered attribute causes neither a flash nor a
    redundant DOM write.

    ``DEFAULTS`` is the per-family ``{family: {mode: id}}`` map (see
    :func:`build_theme_defaults`). This script has no independent notion
    of "which family is active" — it derives the family ``auto`` should
    resolve within from ``FAMILY_BY_ID``, an ``{id: family}`` map baked
    from the same manifest: when the server ``data-theme`` attribute is a
    valid concrete id, that id's family wins (so ``auto`` stays inside the
    family the server already committed to, even if a literal ``"auto"``
    from ``?theme=``/``localStorage`` ends up being the actual candidate);
