"""Build orchestrator: load -> validate -> emit for the design-token generator.

Ties together the rest of the generator package into the one pipeline the
project actually runs:

    python -m osprey.interfaces.design_system.generator.build [--check]

Without ``--check``, it loads the real ``tokens/`` source tree, validates
it (aborting with every error printed if invalid), renders all three
generated artifacts, and writes them under ``static/``. With ``--check``,
it does the same load-and-validate-and-render, but never writes — instead
it diffs each rendered artifact against what's already on disk and exits
non-zero with a unified diff for anything that drifted. This is the
freshness gate a later task wires into CI.

The load/validate/render step is exposed as :func:`build_artifacts` with
explicit ``tokens_dir``/output paths (no hardcoded real paths baked into
its signature), so tests can run the whole pipeline hermetically against a
temporary tree instead of the real one.
