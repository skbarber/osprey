"""Shared resolution of an interface document's ``$extensions.inherits`` opt-out map.

An interface extension document (``interfaces/*.json``) may opt a theme stem
out of authoring its own mode group by mapping it, in its root
``$extensions.inherits`` object, onto a base stem whose group it borrows
instead — e.g. ``{"high-contrast-dark": "dark", "high-contrast-light":
"light"}`` so a purely decorative high-contrast twin doesn't force every
interface to duplicate an identical group.

Both the validator (which fail-closed-checks the map) and the CSS emitter
(which must emit the borrowed group into the opted-out theme's block) have to
agree on where that map lives and what it means. Reading it in exactly one
place is what stops them from drifting: an emitter that does not consult
``inherits`` emits *no* interface tokens into any high-contrast block, and the
validator passes it anyway.
