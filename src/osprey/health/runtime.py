"""Health runtime — single owner of the control-system connector lifecycle.

`HealthRuntime` is an async context manager that lazily constructs at most one
control-system connector and at most one archiver connector, disconnecting each
exactly once on exit. It is the sole owner of both connectors' lifecycles for a
health-suite run: probes that need a control-system connection (e.g.
``channel_read``) acquire it via :meth:`HealthRuntime.get_connector`, and probes
that query the archiver (e.g. ``archiver_freshness``) acquire it via
:meth:`HealthRuntime.get_archiver`; each constructs its connector on first call
and caches it for the rest of the suite. A suite with no such probes never
triggers construction, so no Channel Access client is created — and no PV is
left for the garbage collector to finalize (a GC-finalized pyepics PV segfaults
libca).

The two accessors differ in how they source their config, reflecting the two
connectors' asymmetric roles. The control-system connector is the runtime's
raison d'être — its careful single-ownership exists precisely to keep the CA
client's lifecycle safe — so its config is fixed at construction. The archiver
connector is a secondary, HTTP-class resource (EPICS Archiver Appliance,
MongoDB, DOOCS — none Channel Access), so :meth:`get_archiver` takes its config
block per call, letting the probe honor an explicit per-run ``ctx.config`` over
the global singleton without threading archiver config through every
``HealthRuntime`` construction site.

The get/create/shutdown surface deliberately mirrors
:class:`osprey.mcp_server.control_system.server_context.ControlSystemContext`
and the construct-once/disconnect-once template in
``osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.app._lifespan`` so that P2 (FastAPI lifespan +
teardown hook) and P3 (per-process cache, ``server_context`` idiom) can reuse
this class without API changes.

class HealthRuntime:
    """Async context manager owning at most one lazily-created connector.

    The connector is constructed on the first :meth:`get_connector` call and
    cached; subsequent calls return the same instance. On context exit (or an
    explicit :meth:`shutdown`) the connector is disconnected exactly once, and
    only if one was actually constructed. Teardown is best-effort: a
    ``disconnect()`` that raises is swallowed so a failing connector can never
    mask the suite's own result.

    Construction is serialized. Health checks run concurrently — probes within
    a category are awaited together, and the categories themselves run under a
    single ``gather`` — so several probes can reach an accessor while the
    connector is still ``None``. Without a guard each of them would see the
    empty slot, each would build a connector, and every assignment but the last
    would orphan one: an unreferenced Channel Access client that :meth:`shutdown`
    never disconnects, because it only ever knew about the instance that won the
    race. Both accessors therefore take a single :class:`asyncio.Lock` and
    re-test the cache inside it, so exactly one caller constructs and every
    other waiter returns that same instance. The ``closed`` refusal stays
    outside the lock: a runtime that has already torn its connectors down must
    say so immediately rather than queue behind an in-flight construction.
