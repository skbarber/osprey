"""Core ``systemd_unit`` health category.

Reports whether the ``systemd --user`` manager can actually *see* the boot unit
``osprey scaffold systemd`` wrote, which is a different question from whether
the unit file exists.

The failure this row exists for: when ``$HOME`` lives on NFS/autofs, a lingering
``systemd --user`` manager is started at boot — before the home is mounted. That
manager resolves its unit search path exactly once, finds an empty (or absent)
``~/.config/systemd/user``, and never looks again. The scaffolded unit is then
installed on disk and perfectly well-formed, yet ``systemctl --user`` answers
``not-found`` for it, and the deployment silently fails to come back after every
reboot. Read from the outside it looks like a broken unit; it is really a
mount-ordering problem, and the fix is a ``systemctl --user daemon-reload``
(plus, durably, making the manager start after the home is mounted). Nothing
else in the health suite would notice: the file is on disk, the build is clean,
and the only witness is the manager's own answer.

The category emits exactly one row, ``systemd_unit``, from a deliberate
trigger/report split:

* the **repo** copy (``<project>/osprey.service``) decides whether this
  deployment uses the systemd boot path at all. No repo unit means the operator
  never asked for one, so the row is ``skip`` — not a warning about a missing
  file nobody wanted;
* the **installed** copy plus the manager's ``LoadState`` decide the verdict:
  ``warning`` when the unit was scaffolded but never installed, ``error`` when
  it is installed and the manager still reports ``not-found``, ``ok`` for any
  other ``LoadState`` (``loaded``, ``masked``, ``error``, ``bad-setting`` — all
  states in which the manager can see the unit, which is what this row asks).

Keying off only one of the two produces a false alarm in one direction or the
other: repo-only would warn about every host that deliberately runs OSPREY some
other way, and install-only would stay silent on exactly the host where the
manager has gone blind.

Everything that is not a verdict degrades to ``skip``: no ``systemctl`` on
``PATH`` (macOS, containers), a ``systemctl --user`` that cannot reach a bus, a
timed-out query, or a home directory that cannot be resolved at all. A host with
no user manager is not an unhealthy host.
