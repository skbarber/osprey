"""Core ``providers`` health category.

Runs a lightweight connectivity canary against every provider under
``api.providers``, composing :func:`osprey.health.probes.provider_canary.run`
once per provider. All items run **concurrently** inside the single category
callable (``asyncio.gather``); each canary bridges its synchronous
``check_health`` onto a daemon thread with a per-item bound of
:data:`_PER_ITEM_TIMEOUT_S` seconds, so the category's wall-clock stays ≈ 5s
regardless of how many providers are configured — within the health poll bound.

Results are advisory only: a reachable provider is ``ok``, and every failure
mode (bad key, unknown provider, unreachable endpoint, timeout) is ``warning``.
The category never emits ``error``. Zero configured providers yields no rows.
