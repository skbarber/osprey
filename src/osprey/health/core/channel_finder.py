"""Core ``channel_finder`` health category.

Probes the Channel Finder's channel database, but **only when it is
configured**. The Channel Finder panel is served by an ``osprey web`` sidecar —
there is no compose service, so it never appears in ``deployed_services``. Its
presence is therefore keyed on a top-level ``channel_finder`` config block. The
category stays a valid ``--category`` name at all times; when no
``channel_finder`` block is configured it simply contributes no rows (a silent
skip), so a minimal build shows no tile at all.

The category reads the pipeline's channel store directly, so it gives a useful
reading whether or not any web surface is running. The active ``pipeline_mode``
selects what is consulted: the file-backed paradigms name a database file under
``channel_finder.pipelines.<mode>.database``, while ``graph`` answers from the
deployment's graph store and so reads ``services.graphdb`` instead. The mode
must name a real paradigm
(:data:`~osprey.build.build_tiers.VALID_CHANNEL_FINDER_MODES`); a mode nothing
answers to raises :class:`~osprey.services.channel_finder.core.exceptions.PipelineModeError`
rather than degrading to a row, because that is a defect in the configuration
and not a store that happens to be down. The health runner isolates the failure
to this category, so it surfaces as one error row naming the bad mode.

When configured the category emits:

* ``channel_finder_pipeline`` — the active ``pipeline_mode`` as ``value``
  (``ok``); ``warning`` when no mode is set, or when the named
  ``pipelines.<mode>`` block is absent. The ``graph`` paradigm is the exception
  to that second rule: it stores nothing under ``pipelines.graph``, so the row
  is derived from the mode alone and reads ``graph (store-backed)``;
* ``channel_finder_database`` — the pipeline's ``database.path`` file exists and
  is non-empty (``ok``, file size as ``value``); ``error`` when a path is
  configured but the file is missing or empty (a broken build — the data bundle
  materializes these files); ``warning`` when no ``database.path`` is configured;
* ``channel_finder_freshness`` — that database file's modification age as a
  human-readable ``value`` (e.g. ``"built 3 d ago"``); always ``ok`` and emitted
  only when the file exists — build cadence is informational, not a fault;
* ``channel_finder_channels`` — emitted **only** for the ``middle_layer``
  pipeline with a configured ``duckdb_path``: the channel row count read from the
  materialized DuckDB (``value``); ``warning`` when zero, when the database
  cannot be opened, or when the ``duckdb`` package is unavailable (the check
  degrades, it never crashes the suite). In every other mode this row is simply
  absent.

The ``graph`` paradigm emits neither the database rows nor the channel count —
there is no file to stat and no DuckDB to open. In their place it restates the
two readings the ``graphdb`` category takes, taken by that category's own
builders so both tiles report one store the same way and a fix named in one
place is named in both:

* ``channel_finder_store`` — the store answered over bolt (``ok``, with the
  round-trip latency); ``warning`` when it is unreachable, rejected the
  credential, or is not described by a ``services.graphdb`` block at all;
* ``channel_finder_resources`` — the number of ``(:Resource)`` nodes the corpus
  imported (``value``); ``warning`` when that is zero or could not be read.

Both are advisory: a stopped store is a service that is not running, not a
broken build, so the graph paradigm produces no ``error`` row. The rows carry
this category's names because they answer this category's question — whether
channel search has anything to answer from — next to a ``graphdb`` tile that
reports the same store as a service.
