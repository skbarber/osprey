"""Core ``channel_finder`` health category.

Probes the Channel Finder's channel database, but **only when it is
configured**. The Channel Finder panel is served by an ``osprey web`` sidecar —
there is no compose service, so it never appears in ``deployed_services``. Its
presence is therefore keyed on a top-level ``channel_finder`` config block. The
category stays a valid ``--category`` name at all times; when no
``channel_finder`` block is configured it simply contributes no rows (a silent
skip), so a minimal build shows no tile at all.

The category reads the pipeline's on-disk channel database directly, so it gives
a useful reading whether or not any web surface is running. The active pipeline
mode (``in_context``/``hierarchical``/``middle_layer``) selects which database
file is consulted under ``channel_finder.pipelines.<mode>.database``.

When configured the category emits:

* ``channel_finder_pipeline`` — the active ``pipeline_mode`` as ``value``
  (``ok``); ``warning`` when no mode is set, or when the named
  ``pipelines.<mode>`` block is absent;
* ``channel_finder_database`` — the pipeline's ``database.path`` file exists and
  is non-empty (``ok``, file size as ``value``); ``error`` when a path is
  configured but the file is missing or empty (a broken build — the data bundle
  materializes these files); ``warning`` when no ``database.path`` is configured;
* ``channel_finder_freshness`` — that database file's modification age as a
  human-readable ``value`` (e.g. ``"built 3 d ago"``); always ``ok`` and emitted
  only when the file exists — build cadence is informational, not a fault;
* ``channel_finder_channels`` — emitted **only** for the ``middle_layer``
  pipeline with a configured ``duckdb_path``: the channel row count read from the
  materialized DuckDB (``value``); ``warning`` when zero, when the database
  cannot be opened, or when the ``duckdb`` package is unavailable (the check
  degrades, it never crashes the suite). In every other mode this row is simply
  absent.
