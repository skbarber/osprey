"""Config loading and category-record assembly for a health run.

This module holds the surface-agnostic core of a health run: the single
``config.yml`` load (:func:`load_config`) and the assembly of the merged
category records — built-in "core" categories, declarative YAML categories, and
facility plugins (:func:`build_records`, with its :func:`core_record` /
:func:`skip_record` helpers).

Keeping these off the CLI lets non-CLI surfaces (e.g. the web health view) reuse
the exact same record-assembly and config-degradation behavior instead of
reimplementing it. The CLI (:mod:`osprey.cli.health_cmd`) imports these names
and wires them together.

Design contracts honored here:

* **Single config load.** :func:`load_config` loads ``config.yml`` exactly once
  and reports the outcome through a
  :class:`~osprey.health.core.configuration.ConfigState`. A load failure never
  raises — it degrades into a ``config_ok=False`` result while the rest of the
  report still renders.
* **Config-dependent core categories degrade to skips.** Core categories that
  read the loaded config (:data:`CONFIG_DEPENDENT`) collapse to a single
  "config unavailable" skip row when the config could not be loaded/parsed.
* **``--full`` is the sole on_demand gate.** :data:`ON_DEMAND_CORE` names the
  core categories that default to the on_demand cost class; ``build_records``
  only sets the default cost, never the gating.
