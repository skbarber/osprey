"""Async-native health-suite runner.

Executes a merged set of :class:`~osprey.health.config.CategoryRecord`\\ s and
returns a single :class:`~osprey.health.models.CheckReport`.

Execution model
---------------

* **Categories run concurrently** via :func:`asyncio.gather`.
* **Within a declarative category, only ``requires:`` chains serialize.** Checks
  are executed in topological batches: every check whose dependencies have all
  resolved runs in the same batch, concurrently. Independent checks therefore
  overlap; only a genuine ``A → B`` dependency forces ordering.
* **``requires`` gating.** A dependency *passes* iff its status is ``ok`` or
  ``warning`` — composing literally with ``timeout_status`` (a timeout
  classified ``warning`` counts as passed). A check with any non-passing
  dependency is emitted as ``skip`` without running, and that ``skip`` in turn
  fails its own dependents (the cascade).
* **Isolation.** A probe or callable that raises becomes a single ``error``
  result; it never aborts sibling checks or categories.
* **Per-check timeout.** Each declarative check is awaited under
  :func:`asyncio.wait_for` with a small backstop margin over its ``timeout_s``
  (so a probe's own internal timeout — which yields a richer result — fires
  first). A backstop expiry synthesizes the check's ``timeout_status``.
* **Sync off-loading.** Callable categories that are plain functions run on a
  daemon thread via :func:`osprey.health.offload.run_sync`, so a hung sync check
  can never wedge process exit. That thread has no event loop, so only an
  ``async def`` callable may be handed the suite's shared
  :class:`~osprey.health.runtime.HealthRuntime`; a sync one that asks for it is
  refused with an ``error`` row, and a zero-argument callable of either kind is
  unaffected. See :func:`_run_callable`.
* **Cost gating.** ``on_demand`` categories run only when ``full`` is set;
  otherwise they are emitted as ``skip`` rows carrying a "run with --full" hint.
  ``--category`` selection never elevates cost class — ``full`` is the sole gate.
* **Cost-class deadlines.** Poll-class categories are collectively bounded by
  ``suite_timeout_s``; on_demand categories by ``on_demand_timeout_s`` — the two
  budgets are independent absolute deadlines. At a deadline, unfinished checks
  are *synthesized* rather than dropped: for a declarative category, one row per
  configured check always (a pending check whose dependency failed → ``skip``;
  an eligible pending check → ``error`` "suite deadline exceeded"; a synthesized
  deadline-``error`` fails its own dependents, cascading in topological order).
  A callable-backed category that hits its budget yields exactly one synthesized
  ``error`` row named after the category. A run that synthesizes any such row
  sets :attr:`CheckReport.deadline_hit`.
* **Baseline banner.** While the session is switched away from the deployment
  baseline, the report opens with
  :meth:`~osprey.health.runtime.HealthRuntime.baseline_pinned_row`'s
  informational ``skip`` row naming both targets — the suite reports on the
  deployment as configured, and every other row has to be read in that light.
  On the baseline no row is added at all.
