"""Load facility health categories from ``health.plugins`` entries.

A plugin exposes ``get_health_categories() -> dict[str, CategoryCallable]`` — a
mapping of category name to a callable returning ``list[CheckResult]`` (sync or
async), the same callable shape core and YAML categories use. The callable
normally takes no arguments; an ``async def`` one may declare a ``runtime``
parameter and be handed the suite's shared
:class:`~osprey.health.runtime.HealthRuntime` by keyword, while a sync one that
declares it is refused with an ``error`` row. The full contract is on the
``contributing/extending-osprey`` page. Plugin categories run alongside core and
YAML categories through the identical runner path.

An entry under ``health.plugins`` names that plugin in one of two ways:

* a **dotted module path** (``my_package.health_checks``), imported from the
  process's ``sys.path`` — the plugin has to be installed or otherwise
  importable; or
* a **file path** ending in ``.py`` (``./health/facility_checks.py``), loaded
  straight off disk. A relative path is resolved against the **project root**,
  the same anchor ``data/`` and ``plans/`` paths use, so a deployment can keep
  its checks next to its profile without packaging them or arranging
  ``PYTHONPATH`` in every surface that runs the suite.

A file-path plugin is loaded under a deterministic synthetic module name derived
from its resolved path (``osprey_health_plugin_<hash>``) and registered in
``sys.modules`` before it executes, so dataclasses and postponed annotations
inside it resolve normally. Loading the same file again — which the long-lived
surfaces do on every config-change refresh — **re-executes** the file and
replaces that ``sys.modules`` entry. Module-level state in a plugin therefore
does not survive a refresh, and a plugin must not rely on it doing so.

Loading is defensive: no plugin failure ever crashes the suite. A file-path
entry that cannot even be resolved to an absolute path, an import error, a
missing/non-callable ``get_health_categories``, a bad return type, or a name
that collides with a core/YAML/earlier-plugin category each yields a single
``error`` :class:`~osprey.health.models.CheckResult` in the diagnostic
``plugins`` category — never an exception. Successfully loaded plugin categories
default to ``cost: poll`` with the suite timeout as their budget; a metadata-only
``health.categories.<name>`` override adjusts cost/timeout by name (mirroring the
core-category override channel).
