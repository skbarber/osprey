"""Archiver-freshness health probe — is the archiver actually accumulating data?

Verifies the deployment's archiver is both *reachable* and *live*: it queries a
short trailing window for a facility-declared canary channel through the suite's
shared archiver connector (obtained from the
:class:`~osprey.health.runtime.HealthRuntime` on the probe context via
``ctx.runtime.get_archiver(...)``) and grades the age of the newest archived
sample against a threshold. This generalizes the single most valuable check on a
facility dashboard: the archiver *UI being up* is not the same as the archiver
*archiving* — a wedged ingester leaves the web front-end reachable while data
silently stops flowing, and only the age of the newest sample distinguishes the
two.

The archiver config block (``type`` plus the per-type sub-block) is resolved
with the same precedence as :mod:`~osprey.health.probes.provider_canary`: an
explicit per-run ``ctx.config`` (the web surface) is authoritative when present,
else the global config singleton (CLI/standalone). A declared
``archiver_freshness`` check with **no** ``archiver:`` block configured is a real
misconfiguration and grades ``error`` — not a silent pass.

Grading:

* no ``archiver:`` block configured → ``error`` (misconfiguration);
* the connector is unreachable, or the query raises → ``error`` whose ``details``
  carries ``str(exc)``;
* a sample is found and its age is ``<= max_age_s`` → ``ok``, message
  ``"Fresh (newest sample 42 s old)"`` and ``value`` the sample reading;
* a sample is found but older than ``max_age_s`` → ``warning`` reporting the
  observed age (a reachable-but-stale archiver);
* no samples in the query window → ``warning`` (the newest sample, if any, is
  older than the whole trailing window — indistinguishable from stale, and
  graded the same).

The staleness verdict is deliberately fixed at ``warning``: a facility tunes the
*timeout* severity through the generic ``timeout_status`` check key (handled by
the runner), and this probe invents no staleness-specific severity param.

``timeout_s`` bounds the ``get_data`` call directly; the runner's outer
``wait_for`` allows a small margin so the connector's own timeout fires first.
The trailing window is derived from ``max_age_s`` to be comfortably wider than
the threshold, so a moderately stale sample's true age is still observable rather
than collapsing to an empty-window warning. The age comparison is done entirely
in UTC, which ``get_data``'s ``datetime64[ns, UTC]`` timestamp column guarantees.
