"""Bridge synchronous callables onto the asyncio loop via daemon threads.

The health runner is async-native, but several checks wrap blocking synchronous
I/O (sync plugin callables, provider ``check_health``, ``get_chat_completion``).
Those must run off the event loop without ever wedging process exit when a check
hangs.

Why not :func:`asyncio.to_thread` or a stock :class:`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`?
Both route through ``concurrent.futures.thread``, whose module-level
``_python_exit()`` is registered with :mod:`atexit` and *joins every worker
thread unconditionally* at interpreter shutdown. A single hung health check would
therefore block the process from exiting forever. This module instead hand-rolls
``daemon=True`` threads: daemon threads are never joined at interpreter exit, so an
abandoned check can never block the process.

On timeout the awaiter receives :class:`TimeoutError` and the worker thread is
*abandoned* — it keeps running to completion but, being a daemon, never blocks
exit. A thread whose awaiter is *cancelled* (e.g. the runner backstop cancelling a
hung canary) is abandoned the same way, so no hung thread escapes accounting.
:func:`abandoned_count` is a cumulative event counter the CLI uses to decide
whether to fall back to :func:`os._exit`; :func:`abandoned_alive_count` prunes
threads that have since finished and reports only those still running, which the
refresh scheduler's circuit breaker uses to detect a persistently wedged suite.
