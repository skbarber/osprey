"""Derive the auto ``mcp_servers`` health category from the facility config.

Synthesizes a :class:`~osprey.health.config.CategoryRecord` of
:class:`~osprey.health.config.CheckSpec`\\ s — one ``mcp`` probe per configured
MCP server — from the ``claude_code.servers`` block that ``osprey build`` writes
into ``config.yml``. This lets the framework check every wired MCP endpoint's
reachability (and, where declared, its tool surface) without the operator
hand-authoring a ``health.categories.mcp_servers`` block.

The single entry point is :func:`derive_mcp_servers`. It is a pure function of
the parsed :class:`~osprey.health.config.HealthSettings` and the
``${VAR}``-resolved config mapping; wiring the derived record into the merged
record set is the caller's concern (``build_records``), not this module's.

Parsing is deliberately defensive: any malformed server entry is skipped
silently rather than raising, because the config this consumes has already been
validated for the concerns the health parser owns — a shape surprise here should
degrade the derived category, never fail the whole health run.
