"""Comment-preserving YAML configuration writer.

Unified module for all comment-preserving YAML mutations. Uses ruamel.yaml
(round-trip mode) to read, modify, and write YAML files without stripping
comments, formatting, or ordering.

This module consolidates the former ``yaml_config.py`` and ``config_updater.py``
into a single source of truth for config file modifications.

For read-only config access, use ``utils/config.py`` (ConfigBuilder, get_config_value).

Typical usage:
    from osprey.utils.config_writer import config_add_to_list, config_update_fields

    # Add entry to a YAML list
    config_add_to_list(Path("config.yml"), ["scaffold", "user_owned"], "rules/facility")

    # Apply structured key-value updates
    config_update_fields(Path("config.yml"), {
        "control_system.writes_enabled": True,
        "control_system.connector.virtual_accelerator.writes_enabled": True,
        "approval.tools.channel_write": "always",

#: Directory, under the agent-data (state) root, holding config backups.
#:
#: Config backups deliberately do NOT sit beside the file they copy. A project's
#: ``config.yml`` lives in the render, and the render becomes root-owned when the
#: container split lands: creating a *new* file next to it needs write permission
#: on the render directory, which the admin image will not have. Every backup
#: here runs *before* its writer touches anything, so under the old sibling
#: scheme the ``PermissionError`` would have turned each of these config writes
#: into a 500 in that image, without a byte being written. The state zone is the
#: tree that stays writable across the split and survives a rebuild, so backups
#: belong there. This is a hard precondition for the split, not a tidy-up.
#:
#: The zone is never spelled literally: it is read from ``agent_data.base_dir``
#: through :func:`agent_data_base_dir` and anchored with :func:`anchored_path`,
#: so a project that relocates its state zone moves its config backups with it.
CONFIG_BACKUP_DIRNAME = "config-backups"


def config_backup_path(config_path: Path) -> Path:
    """Where a backup of *config_path* belongs: inside the agent-data state zone.

    The single spelling of the backup scheme. Three writers take config backups
    — this module's :func:`update_yaml_file`, the Web Terminal's ``/api/config``
    and ARIEL's ``PUT /config`` — and each of them writes into a project that the
    container split will make read-only. One helper so the three cannot drift on
    a location that has to be right in all three for the split to work at all.

    **The anchor is a fact about the config file, not a caller's choice.**
    ``agent_data.base_dir`` is documented and rendered relative to the deployment
    repo ROOT — the directory holding ``profile.yml`` and ``var/`` — never
    relative to the render that ``config.yml`` sits in. So the anchor is derived
    from the config itself, applying the same precedence
    :func:`~osprey.utils.workspace.resolve_project_root` applies at runtime: the
    config's own ``project_root`` key when it names a directory that exists
    here, and :func:`repo_root_for_config` otherwise. That is the helper every
    other state-zone consumer resolves the root with:

    * flat layout (``<project>/config.yml``) → ``<project>``, whose state zone
      is ``<project>/var/agent_data``;
    * deployment repo (``<repo>/build/config.yml``) → ``<repo>``, so the backup
      lands in the durable ``var/`` and not in the disposable render;
    * container (``/app/<project>/build/config.yml``) → ``/app/<project>``,
      which is exactly the directory ``Dockerfile.j2`` pre-creates and chowns
      ``var/agent_data/config-backups`` under.

    That last one is why this takes no ``project_dir`` override any more. A
    caller passing the *render* directory (the web panel's ``project_cwd``) made
    the route mkdir ``<render>/var`` inside the root-owned render zone, which
    fails with ``PermissionError`` before a byte of the save is written — the
    admin Config panel could not save at all. One anchor rule, derived from the
    one input every caller already holds, so no caller can disagree with the
    runtime about where the state zone is.

    The filename keeps the source file's own name, so two configs backed up into
    one zone cannot land on each other; there is one slot per name, overwritten
    on each save, which is the retention the sibling scheme had.
