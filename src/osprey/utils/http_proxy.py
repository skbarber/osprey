"""Shared constants for OSPREY's HTTP reverse-proxy / relay hops.

OSPREY has more than one component that relays an upstream HTTP response back
to a browser: the web-terminal panel proxy
(``osprey.interfaces.web_terminal.routes.proxy``) and the bluesky-web
sidecar's SSE draft relay (``osprey.interfaces.bluesky_web.draft_relay``).
Each must strip the same hop-by-hop headers before re-emitting the upstream's
headers downstream -- a header list that had been copied verbatim between them.
Keeping it here, imported by both, prevents the two lists from drifting.
