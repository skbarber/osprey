# Services that fail closed on an unset bearer token (no insecure default in
# their compose templates), so a deploy must supply real secrets. Maps each
# deployed-service name to the token env var(s) it requires. event_dispatcher
# and dispatch_worker both list the same pair because they share one .env:
# the dispatcher forwards routed requests to workers using DISPATCH_WORKER_TOKEN,
# so either service alone still needs both vars minted. bluesky needs its own
# launch token (see ``security.require_armed`` in
# ``osprey.services.bluesky_bridge``) plus the API key the bridge presents to
# the co-deployed Tiled catalog. The Tiled key hangs off "bluesky" rather than a
# "tiled" key of its own because "tiled" is never a member of
# ``deployed_services``, so the membership guard in ``_ensure_service_tokens``
# would skip it and the key would never mint.
#
# openobserve is included for a DIFFERENT reason than the others. Its compose
# template *does* carry an insecure ``${ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD:-Complexpass#123}``
# default, so a deploy does not fail without a real secret — left alone it
# silently comes up on a shared, publicly-known password. Because that store
# captures full agent conversation transcripts (every telemetry content gate
# defaults ON), minting a per-deploy ``ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD`` replaces the
# shared default with a strong secret that BOTH the container and the agent's
# telemetry resolver read from the same ``.env`` value (single source of truth).
# The agent's config references ``${ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD:-Complexpass#123}``, so
# it stays launchable before the first deploy and picks up the minted value on
# its next launch. The email is a username, not a secret (it has a sensible
# non-secret default), so only the password is minted. See
# ``_generate_openobserve_password`` for why a plain token recipe won't do.
#
# postgresql follows the openobserve rationale: its compose template carries an
# insecure ``${ARIEL_DB_PASSWORD:-ariel}`` default, so left alone the ARIEL
# store comes up on a shared, publicly-known password. Minting a per-deploy
# ``ARIEL_DB_PASSWORD`` replaces it with a strong secret that the container
# (POSTGRES_PASSWORD) and the agent's DSN (derived from the ``services.postgresql``
# block by ``resolve_ariel_dsn``, which substitutes the same
# ``${ARIEL_DB_PASSWORD:-ariel}``) read from the same ``.env`` value. An explicit
# ``ariel.database.uri`` still wins when a project sets one.
# NOTE: Postgres only reads POSTGRES_PASSWORD when *initializing* a fresh data
# volume — a pre-existing volume keeps its original password (same
# stale-volume caveat as openobserve; recreate the volume to adopt the minted
# value).
#
# mongodb is the archiver store, and follows the same shape one step further:
# its compose template carries an insecure ``${MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD:-osprey}``
# default, and the minted value has to reach THREE readers, not two — the
# container (MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD), the archiver_recorder service writing
# samples in-network, and the agent's own connector, whose config block names
# the variable rather than carrying a value
# (``archiver.mongodb_archiver.password_env: MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD``). All three
# resolve the same ``.env`` entry, which is what keeps one store openable by
# the process that writes it and the process that reads it. The seeder and
# ``osprey sim apply`` read it from the project ``.env`` explicitly rather than
# from an ambient environment.
# NOTE: mongod, like postgres, reads its root credentials only when
# initializing a fresh data volume — the same stale-volume caveat applies.

        ignore. Empty on the common paths (nothing minted, or nothing minted
        that a volume adopts), and the input to
        ``_preflight_stale_store_volumes``.

    ``osprey up`` passes the deployment repo's own ``.env`` explicitly; a caller
    that passes nothing falls back to a cwd-relative ``.env`` (see the
    assignment below). Everything the rest of this docstring says about "the
    ``.env``" is about the file the caller named.

    For any token var (per ``_SERVICE_TOKEN_VARS``, keyed by the deployed
    services present) unset — or present with an empty value — in BOTH the
    process env and that ``.env``,
    generate a strong random value (``_generate_token``: ``token_urlsafe(32)``
    unless the var registers a different alphabet in ``_VAR_GENERATORS``) and
    append it to ``.env``
    (``chmod 0o600``, matching the build-time convention). Existing non-empty
    values are never overwritten, so re-running ``osprey up`` is idempotent.
    No-op unless a token-requiring service is actually deployed.

    **An empty value is not a decision here.** Osprey's general rule is that an
    explicitly empty variable is the operator saying *leave this alone* — a
    blank ``NO_PROXY=`` is a real setting, and a missing line is not the same
    thing. These vars are the deliberate exception, because every name this loop
    can reach is a machine-generated secret with no meaningful empty state. An
    empty one does not switch a service's authentication off; it runs the
    service with no authentication at all, and for the three store passwords it
    hands the container back the published default its compose template
    interpolates with ``:-``. Nothing is expressible as ``TOKEN=`` that leaving
    the var unset does not express better, so the operator gives up nothing and
    a deploy stops coming up unauthenticated with nobody told. The same
    judgement is already made one function over, for the RE manager's
    control-socket keys — see ``_is_set`` inside
    :func:`_ensure_bluesky_qserver_zmq_keys`, which spells out that an empty
    value is not honoured there either. This brings the token path into
    agreement with it rather than adding a third convention.

    The exception is bounded by ``required_vars``, and that bound is what makes
    it safe: it is exactly ``_SERVICE_TOKEN_VARS`` filtered by
    ``deployed_services`` membership (built below, from a module constant no
    runtime path mutates), so the only names whose empty spelling is overridden
    are the machine-minted secrets that map declares. Nothing else travelling in
    this ``.env`` can reach the predicate — the proxy settings (``HTTP_PROXY``,
    ``NO_PROXY``), where a blank value *is* the setting, belong to neither
    ``_SERVICE_TOKEN_VARS`` nor ``_VALIDATE_ONLY_VARS``, and the validate-only
    loop below never mints anything at all.

    Whatever a value's origin, it is then checked at the boundary: one that
    matches a compose template's published default is refused by name
    (``_is_forbidden_value``), and one that fails a registered format constraint
    is refused too. A minted value satisfies both by construction, so either
    finding is always about a value an operator supplied.

    Minting over a blank also rewrites this process's copy of it. The deploy
    loads the project ``.env`` over its own environment before reaching here, so
    a blank line in that file leaves a stale empty variable behind that would
    outrank the newly appended line for compose's interpolation. The file is the
    source of truth and the environment is its mirror, so both are updated
    together; a name that was never in the environment stays out of it.

    One empty spelling is still left alone, because minting cannot repair it: a
    var the ``.env`` does not carry at all, exported empty in the deploying
    shell. That export is the operator's own, it outranks any ``--env-file``
    line a mint would write, and overwriting a shell the deploy does not own is
    not this function's business — so writing one would report a mint that
    changes nothing. It keeps the older treatment: on a loopback deploy the service
    fails closed on its own; on a deployment the build rendered as reachable
    off-host (a wildcard bind, or the host-networked web-terminal stack) we
    refuse rather than bind a fail-open-at-bind server to all interfaces.

    Minting is unconditional for every var a deployed service declares: these
    tokens authenticate *network callers* to a service's own HTTP boundary and
    are not a hardware-safety layer. Whether a plan or a write is permitted is
    decided at the connector (``writes_enabled`` plus the per-put channel
    limits), which every write path — agent-side and bridge-side alike — must
    still clear. No deploy-time value is read here for safety semantics.

    A mint lands once and stays there. Nothing is copied anywhere afterwards:
    the file written here IS the deployment's one secret store, sitting at the
    repo root beside the ``profile.yml`` that describes the stack, and it is the
    same file compose is pointed at (``--env-file <repo>/.env``). A second copy
    owned by the profile must never be written: two stores drift, and a rebuild
    reading the wrong one mints secrets the running containers reject. One
    directory, one file, no second copy to keep in step.

    Independently of the above, every var in ``_VALIDATE_ONLY_VARS``
    (e.g. ``ARIEL_DSN``) is checked against its ``_VAR_VALIDATORS`` constraint
    when present in the effective env — but never minted, and never required:
    this runs even when no deployed service pulls in any ``_SERVICE_TOKEN_VARS``
    entry at all, since a validate-only var's presence does not depend on
    ``deployed_services`` membership.

    A store qualifies on either of two independent grounds, because neither

    * *this run minted the credential* — the value is brand new and a volume
      that already exists never adopted it. The only rule that can speak for a

    * *the store's own container disagrees with ``.env``* — a running container
      holds the credential the volume actually has, so a ``.env`` that differs
      cannot authenticate no matter who wrote it or how long ago. This is the
      rule that recognises a deployment already in the broken state, where a
      previous run's mint is sitting in ``.env`` and nothing new is minted.

    Deliberately NOT a third ground: a surviving volume with no container to
    compare against and nothing minted. That is simply a stopped deployment —

    that setting separately.

    Never raises into a deploy: a missing/unreadable ``channel_limits.json``

    """Mint the RE Manager's control-socket CURVE keypair into the project ``.env``.

    The manager's 0MQ control socket is the one route to plan execution that
    does not pass the bridge's launch-token gate, and that gate is only
    meaningful if it is the sole way in. The socket publishes no port, but the
    queueserver container has to sit on ``osprey-network`` as well as the
    internal one, so key authentication — not network placement — is what
    keeps another container on that network from driving the manager directly.

    The two halves must pair, which is why this cannot ride on
    ``_ensure_service_tokens``: ``_VAR_GENERATORS``' recipes take no arguments
    and mint each variable independently, so there is no way to express "this
    value is derived from that one" — and two independently random keys are
    exactly a broken CURVE handshake. A pair-aware hook in that map would have
    to reach across variables mid-loop; a separate step is the smaller change,
    and it leaves that function's minting, exposure and validation semantics
    untouched.

    **Both halves are secrets.** The public key is not the usual
    "public keys are safe to publish" case: upstream ``bluesky-queueserver``
    clients authenticate with a fixed, publicly-known client keypair, so
    holding the manager's public key is by itself enough to reach its control
    socket. Both values therefore go into the 0600 ``.env`` and neither is
    ever logged — only the variable names are.

    Existing values win, in the same "process env, then ``.env``" precedence
    ``_ensure_service_tokens`` uses, with one repair: when only the private
    key is set, the public half is *derived* from it rather than minted, so an
    operator who supplied their own manager key gets a matching pair instead
    of a silent handshake failure. The reverse (a public key with no private
    half) cannot be repaired — a secret key is not recoverable from a public
    one — so it warns rather than fabricating a key that would not pair.

    **Plaintext is not a supported mode.** An explicitly empty private key is
    treated as unset, not as "encryption off": the compose template expands
    this variable with a ``:?`` guard, which fails on empty exactly as it does
    on unset, so an empty value cannot produce a running stack — only a
    confusing abort deep inside ``compose``. Refusing here turns that into an
    actionable message. The operator override story is to supply a valid pair
    of their own, never to switch encryption off.

    Raises into a deploy only for that one case — a deliberate empty value,
    which is unsatisfiable. Everything else (a malformed key, an unavailable
    ``zmq``) logs a warning and returns, leaving the ``:?`` guard to stop the
    deploy rather than this function.

    * A **stale pin** is the failure mode the layering makes possible. The

      of the day and then forgotten, rather than a value anybody chose for this
      host. The stack starts on the superseded value, looking healthy.

    is not deliberate. Deliberate overrides get a single info line naming the
    keys; the warning is reserved for stale pins (see

    Answering the stale-pin question needs the shared file's *previous*
    contents, so this both reads and advances the record at
    :data:`ENV_CHAIN_STATE_RELPATH`. It advances it with one deliberate
    exception: a key currently reported as stale keeps its recorded digest
    rather than adopting today's shared value. Without that, the warning would
    fire exactly once — the next deploy would find the shared value unchanged
    since the record and fall silent while the pin was still stale. Holding the
    entry back makes the report persist until the operator resolves it, either
    by dropping the key from ``.env`` or by setting it to a value of their own.

    that record back out of them.

    ``None`` means *no record*, which is not the same as "an empty chain". A

    Membership is a **build-time** decision. The rendered documents name the

    so a file added or removed afterwards changes nothing about what the stack
    reads. Adding ``.env.shared`` to a repo built without one does not put its
    values into the containers; removing it from a repo built with one points a
    rendered ``env_file:`` at a path that is gone.

    Neither failure announces itself. The first comes up healthy on values the

    """Warn when a shell export and the env chain disagree about a value.

    The chain under ``<repo>`` — ``.env.shared`` then ``.env``, later winning —
    is the deployment's one secret store, and every compose invocation is
    pointed at it explicitly (see :func:`_env_file_args`). But the env file is
    not the last word on document interpolation, and *which* word it is depends
    on the provider (see below). Either way a stale export means the stack can
    start on a value its volumes were never initialized with — an openobserve
    that will not accept the password in the chain, a database whose data
    directory answers to the chain's value while the container is handed
    another one.

    The same precedence the mint already designs to (``_ensure_service_tokens``
    skips a var the process env sets, so no divergent value is ever written
    into the chain): the export is honoured, the store is left intact, and
    nothing on either path tells the operator the two disagree. This is that
    telling.

    **Which side wins is provider-scoped, and inverted between the two.** Docker
    Compose substitutes the exported value — the env file is its lowest
    precedence source — while podman-compose reads its env file *first* and
    ignores the export. So the same divergence means "the stack runs on your
    shell's value" under one provider and "your export is being silently
    dropped" under the other, and a single wording could only be right for one
    of them. With no *provider* given, both are named rather than guessing:
    the ambiguity is the honest report, and the remedy that resolves it (unset
    the name) is the same either way.

    Only variables the rendered compose files actually interpolate are compared,
    against the merged chain — what the deployment's env files collectively say
    after ``.env`` has been laid over ``.env.shared``, which is the value
    compose is handed however the fragment is spelled. An exported name the
    chain does not set is not a divergence (there is nothing for it to
    contradict), and a chain key no compose file reads cannot change what
    starts.

    The chain's own layering is reported separately, at two severities, by
    :func:`_report_chain_overrides` — called from here so that one preflight
    covers everything the env chain can quietly get wrong.

    **A warning, never a refusal.** Exporting a variable over the store is a
    legitimate gesture — a one-off run against another host's credentials, a
    rotation in progress — and a deploy that refused it would break the escape
    hatch to protect people from using it.

    **Names only, never values.** Which variable diverged is the actionable
    fact; what either side holds is a secret, and a warning is the one place a
    secret would leak into a terminal, a CI log and a bug report at once. Same
    rule as :func:`osprey.utils.dotenv.compose_unsafe_vars` and the build's own
    divergence warning.

    :param compose_files: The compose files this deploy will start, in ``-f``
        order. Relative entries resolve against *repo_root*, exactly as
        :func:`osprey.deployment.compose_generator.compose_base_cmd` resolves
        them. Unreadable entries are skipped — a missing compose file is the
        start's own error to raise, not this advisory's.
    :param repo_root: The deployment repo root; both the compose project
        directory and the home of the env chain compose is pointed at.
    :param environ: The process environment to compare against. ``None`` reads
        the live one, overlaid with the shell values the CLI's entry-time
        ``.env`` load replaced (:func:`~osprey.utils.config.dotenv_shell_overrides`)
        — the comparison is against what the operator's shell actually
        exported, which the in-process override would otherwise have erased.

        for one, selecting which precedence the warning states. ``None`` names
        both.

    Exposure is a property of the build. The bind address is baked into every
    ``ports:`` entry the build wrote, and nothing is re-rendered on a start — so
    the only honest answer is the one the rendered files already give, and there
    is no flag that could change it. Making a deployment reachable is
    ``osprey set deployment.bind_address=0.0.0.0`` followed by a build.

    The answer feeds the empty-token refusal in :func:`_ensure_service_tokens`,
    which is why it is computed here rather than inferred there: an exposed
    deployment gets the fail-closed token rules on the strength of what it
    publishes, not on the strength of anything the operator typed.

    Three independent ways to be reachable, and each one counts on its own. A
    services binding on a wildcard address is the obvious one. The second is the
    web-terminal stack: every service in it runs ``network_mode: host`` and its
    nginx "binds every interface, unrestricted" (``docker-compose.web.yml.j2``),
    so a web deploy is off-host reachable with no published port anywhere in
    ``compose_files`` — which is exactly the case a wildcard-binding check alone
    would call private.

    The third is a services-stack service the build put on the host network. It
    publishes no port either, so only the interface it was rendered to bind says
    whether it is reachable (:func:`_host_network_bound_off_host`). The
    templates bind loopback there, which is what keeps the default host-mode
    deployment private — but the bind is overridable, and an overridden one is
    as reachable as any wildcard publication.

    Dev-ness is a property of the RENDER: ``osprey build --dev`` stages a wheel

    ``OSPREY_DEV`` build arg; a plain build emits the pinned
    ``osprey-framework==<version>`` install and nothing else. The rendered YAML
    is therefore the single source of truth for which flavor ``build/`` holds —
    read here rather than kept in side-channel bookkeeping that could disagree
    with it.

    Only services that install the framework at image-build time matter (their
    ``build.args`` carry ``OSPREY_VERSION``). Pure-image services and images
    built at start time (dispatch worker, personas) take their dev-ness from the

    """Stop this deployment and start it again from ``build/``.

    ``down`` then ``up``, not ``compose restart``. The difference is the whole
    point of the change: ``compose restart`` restarts each container against the
    definition it was CREATED with, so a rebuilt image, an edited compose file
    or a newly minted token reaches nothing until something recreates the
    container. This recreates them, which is what an operator who typed
    ``restart`` after a build is asking for.

    It starts ``build/`` as built, and re-renders nothing from ``profile.yml``,
    exactly like :func:`up_as_built` — including the one documented exception:
    a web-terminal deployment re-renders that stack's compose file, nginx
    config and landing page at every start, because those three follow the user
    roster rather than the build. The drift gate lives in the CLI, ahead of this
    call.

    The order inside is deliberate. Everything the start would refuse is read
    and settled BEFORE the ``down``, so a restart that cannot start does not
    stop the running stack on its way to saying so.

    Service tokens are re-minted on the way back up, into the repo's own
    ``.env`` — the same file every compose invocation is pointed at — because
    the start half is :func:`_start_as_built` unchanged.

    Args:
        repo_root: The deployment repo.
        detached: Run in detached mode.
        dev_mode: Stage the local osprey checkout into the images.
        keep_archiver_base: Leave a mismatched archiver base in place instead
            of rebuilding it (see :func:`_stage_archiver_store`).

    Raises:
        NoRenderedBuildError: When ``build/`` holds nothing to start. Nothing is
            stopped.
        RuntimeError: From the preflights or from the stop itself.
