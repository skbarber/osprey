"""Provision the OpenObserve ingest identity against a store that is already up.

Every other credential this deploy handles is one OSPREY chooses: the mint in
:func:`osprey.deployment.container_lifecycle._ensure_service_tokens` generates a
value, writes it into the project ``.env``, and compose hands it to the
container that will accept it. The ingest identity inverts that. It is an
OpenObserve **service account**, and a service account's token is issued by the
server: it does not exist until the store is running and has been asked to
create the account, so there is nothing to write before ``compose up`` and no
value for a generator to invent. Provisioning is therefore a *harvest*, and it
runs after the store is live.

The sequence is verify-then-heal, and it is idempotent by design because it runs
on every start:

1. wait for ``GET /healthz`` (running is not ready);
2. **verify** the token the ``.env`` already carries by making one read-only
   call as the ingest identity. A store that accepts it is a store that needs
   nothing, and the run says nothing at all;
3. **heal** as root, and only then: read the account back (``404`` means it was
   never created, or its data volume was replaced), create it when it is
   missing, and re-issue the token when the one the store holds does not
   authenticate. OpenObserve has no in-place rotation for a service account
   token, so re-issuing is delete plus create plus read back;
4. write the harvested token into the ``.env`` and say so.

Two properties of the store shape the code and are easy to get wrong:

* **its bodies are not reliably JSON.** A rejection is HTTP 401 with the bare
  string ``Unauthorized Access``; a successful ingest returns an EMPTY body; a
  malformed field is answered with a bare serde message. Nothing here calls
  ``.json()`` without tolerating a parse failure.
* **the identity lives in the data volume and the token lives in the ``.env``.**
  Recreating ``openobserve_data`` deletes the account while the ``.env`` keeps
  its now-dead secret, which is exactly the case step 3 repairs.

Nothing here is fatal. Telemetry is one panel of a control room, and a deploy
whose channels, plan runs and archive are all up should not be refused because
its ingest account could not be provisioned. Every failure warns with the one
thing to do about it, and the deploy carries on.

    raising, because a store that never came up is reported like every other

    The wait is in two phases, because the two ways this can fail deserve very
    different patience. A published port is bound by the runtime's own proxy as
