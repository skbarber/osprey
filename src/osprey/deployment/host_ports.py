"""Deploy-time host-port conflict preflight.

Generated OSPREY projects publish their service host ports on a fixed address
(``127.0.0.1`` by default). Bringing up a second project on the same host makes
``docker compose up`` collapse mid-start with a bare "address already in use",
with no diagnosis of which port, which service, or who is holding it. This
module parses the published ports out of the rendered compose files and, before
any container is touched, reports every collision with the exact config key to
change.

Two kinds of collision are detected:

1. **Duplicate** — two services in THIS deploy publish the same
   ``(host_ip, host_port)``. Purely static; found from the parsed bindings.
2. **External** — a TCP connect-probe finds something already listening on a
   published address. The holder is attributed by querying the container
   runtime; a listener that belongs to one of THIS project's own containers is
   not a conflict, so an idempotent redeploy stays green.

A service placed on the host's network namespace renders no ``ports:`` block at
all — it binds its port on the host directly — so parsing compose files alone
would leave exactly the ports two projects are most likely to fight over out of
the check. Those bindings are therefore *derived* from the rendered config (see
:func:`derive_host_network_bindings`) and join the same two checks.

    Such a service publishes nothing — compose has no port map to publish when
    the container shares the host's namespace — so its bound ports appear in no
    compose file and would escape the preflight entirely. That is exactly the
    collision a second project on one host hits first: both deploys bind the
    same dispatcher and worker ports, and the loser dies at startup with a bare
    "address already in use".

    The ports are derived the same way the templates derive them, from the same
    keys, so a project that moved them is checked where it actually binds:

    - the dispatcher binds ``services.event_dispatcher.port``, on the interface
      named by its optional ``bind`` override;
    - worker ``i`` (1-based) binds
      ``worker_port_base + (i - 1) * worker_port_stride``, one port per
      ``worker_count``;
    - every OTHER host-mode service block binds ``services.<name>.port`` — the
      same per-service convention :func:`_remedy_for_service` already names as
      the generic remedy — on its optional ``bind`` override. A facility
      template is free to bind something the framework cannot know about, so a
      host-mode block with no usable ``port`` key is *announced* as escaping
      the preflight rather than silently skipped: the whole failure mode this
      derivation exists for is a port that appears in no ``ports:`` block. The
      bundled outbound-only bridges (:data:`_HOST_MODE_PORTLESS_SERVICES`)
      bind nothing and are exempt from both the derivation and the warning.

    Derived bindings are labeled with the service's CONFIG key (``my_ioc_gw``),
    not a compose service name: the binding comes from the rendered config, and
    that spelling is what makes the generic remedy key correct as written.
