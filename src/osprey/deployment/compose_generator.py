    2. The config's ``project_root`` key — but only when it names a directory
       that exists here. A project built with ``--runtime-root`` records the
       path it will run at *inside a container* (``/app/<name>``), which is not
       a host path at all; taking it would pin compose to a directory the host
       does not have.
    3. The working directory. Every repo-scoped verb chdirs into the repo root
       before reaching a compose invocation, so this is correct — and it is what
       the whole deployment layer relied on implicitly before the contract
       existed.

    command OSPREY runs — ``up``, ``down``, ``restart``, ``rm``, ``build``,
    ``pull``, ``logs``, the web stack's own invocations — is built from here,
    so no path in any rendered compose file can resolve against a different
    base depending on which verb ran it.

    TWO SHAPES, ONE PROJECT DIRECTORY
    =================================

    Both providers OSPREY supports must end up resolving every relative path in
    every rendered compose file against the repo root. They are told so in
    different ways, because they parse different flags.

    Docker Compose v2 (and the default when no probe result is threaded down)::

        <runtime> compose [--progress plain]
            --project-directory <repo-root>
            -f <repo-root>/build/<file> ...
            [--env-file <repo-root>/.env.shared --env-file <repo-root>/.env]

    ``--project-directory`` is what makes the rest true. Without it compose
    derives the project directory from the FIRST ``-f`` file's location, so a
    services invocation resolved relative paths against ``build/services/``
    while the web stack's resolved them against wherever its file happened to
    be written — two bases for one deployment, and the reason the two stacks
    could never share an invocation. With the repo root pinned, one base holds
    for both, and every relative path in every template is spelled against it.

    podman-compose::

        <runtime> compose [--progress plain]
            -f <repo-root>/.osprey-compose.yml
            [--env-file <repo-root>/build/.env.merged]

    No podman-compose version parses ``--project-directory``, so the pin has to
    be made a property of the ``-f`` list instead: the rendered files are merged
    into ONE document at the repo root
    (:func:`~osprey.deployment.compose_merge.write_merged_compose`), which puts
    the only ``-f`` file's own directory at the root. That is where every
    version chdir's — the ones that follow ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_DIR`` and the ones
    that override it with the first compose file's dirname — so the same
    relative paths resolve to the same files on all of them. The environment
    half of the same pin is :func:`compose_provider_env`; a caller that builds
    this argv without it is handing the newer versions a project directory of
    wherever the operator happened to be standing.

    The ``--env-file`` fragment differs for the same kind of reason: repeated
    flags mean "merge these" to docker and "keep the last one" to
    podman-compose, so the podman shape is handed a single pre-merged file. Both
    fragments come from
    :func:`osprey.deployment.container_lifecycle._env_file_args`, which is also
    where the merged file is (re)generated.

    Neither shape uses compose ``profiles:``/``--profile``: podman-compose's
    support for them differs by version, and a service silently left out of a
    deploy is exactly the failure this seam exists to prevent.

    The runtime argv is taken as an argument rather than resolved here, for the
    same reason :func:`osprey.deployment.runtime_helper.with_plain_progress`
    takes one: each call site reaches its runtime through the
    ``get_runtime_command`` name bound in its own module, which is the seam the
    deploy tests patch. The probe result is passed in for the same reason.

    :param runtime_cmd: Resolved compose argv base, e.g. ``["docker", "compose"]``
        (optionally already carrying ``--progress plain``). Never mutated.
    :param compose_files: Compose files for this invocation, in ``-f`` order.
        For the podman-compose shape these are the inputs to the merge, in the
        same order — the merged document is rewritten on every invocation, so it
        always describes the files this invocation was given.
    :param repo_root: The deployment repo root — the compose project directory.
    :param env_file_args: An already-resolved ``--env-file`` fragment, for

    Called on the deploy path before any bind mount is created, for the
    directories several writers share: the facility-knowledge bundle (bound into
    every entitled web-terminal container read-write, and into the qmd sidecar
    read-only) and any other corpus the sidecar indexes.

    Two failures this prevents, in order of how often they bite:

    1. **Root-owned mount source.** Left to the container runtime, a rootful
       daemon creates a missing bind source owned by root. The host operator who
       authors the bundle can then no longer write it, and neither can a
       container that does not run as root. Pre-creating it here means the
       directory always exists, owned by whoever ran the deploy.
    2. **Cross-container invisibility.** See :data:`SHARED_CORPUS_DIR_MODE` —
       the setgid bit is what gives every writer's output one common group.

    GID STRATEGY, stated rather than implied, in two halves:

    * **Host side — the group is inherited, never invented.** This sets the
      setgid *mode*; it does not ``chown`` the directory to a numeric GID. A
      hardcoded GID is wrong on every host but the one it was chosen on, and
      changing a directory's group needs privileges the deploy path is not
      guaranteed to have. The shared group is therefore whatever group the
      deploying user's directory already carries, retargetable by an operator
      with one out-of-band ``chgrp`` and no code change.
    * **Container side — membership is granted explicitly.** setgid confers
      group OWNERSHIP of newly created files; it does NOT make any process a
      MEMBER of that group, and a container's process carries only the groups
      its image's ``/etc/group`` gives it. The returned gid is therefore emitted
      as ``group_add:`` on every service that mounts the corpus (see
      :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.render.render_web_terminals`),
      which is what actually gives those containers access. Without that half,
      access would hold only where the deploying user's uid happens to match the
      image's — an accident, not a property.

    Known limit, not worked around here: setgid fixes group ownership, while the
    permission BITS on each new file still come from the writing process's
    umask. A container writing under the common ``022`` creates ``rw-r--r--``
    files — group-readable, which is all the sidecar's indexing and another
    container's reading need, but not group-writable. Making one container able
    to overwrite another's individual files would need ``umask 002`` inside the
    image, which is an image property and not this function's to set.
