"""Factory reset for a deployment repo — the destructive end of the lifecycle.

``osprey reset`` returns a deployment to the state a fresh ``osprey init``
leaves behind, without touching the source zone: the stack is stopped, the
containers and volumes carrying this checkout's identity are removed along with
the images this deployment built, the agent's memory is destroyed, the tokens
``osprey up`` minted are stripped out of ``.env``, and every derived artifact —
``build/`` and the merged compose document a deploy writes at the repo root —
is deleted.
(Images are scoped differently, and the boundary below says how.)

**What survives is kept deliberately, and the printed plan says so out loud.**
``var/audit/`` — the safety audit log, the record of what the agent was asked to
do and what it did — survives a reset, because the reason to keep an audit trail
is strongest exactly when someone is wiping the thing it describes.
``--purge-audit`` destroys it under the same typed gate. And ``.env`` keeps
every value that was not minted by a deploy: the provider keys an operator
supplied are theirs, not this deployment's, and a reset that silently took them
would make a re-deploy impossible for reasons the operator could not see. The
web tier's credential files (:data:`WEB_CREDENTIAL_FILES`) survive on that same
principle — they are write-once, so what is in them is what an operator or one
earlier deploy put there — and they are disclosed for the opposite reason: a
reset that quietly left every account able to log in is as much a surprise as
one that quietly locked them all out.

SCOPING BOUNDARY — the safety core of this module
=================================================

``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`` is derived from the repo's *directory name*, so two
checkouts of one deployment on a single host — a clone beside the original, a
git worktree, a colleague's copy under another home directory — share a project
name, a volume namespace, and an image tag. A destructive verb scoped by project
name alone would reach into the other checkout's data.

So nothing here is removed on a project-name match. A container or volume is
removed only when it carries
:data:`~osprey.deployment.compose_generator.REPO_ID_LABEL` set to *this*
checkout's identity (:func:`~osprey.deployment.compose_generator.repo_identity`,
the single spelling of that rule, shared with the render that baked the label
in). Both conditions, never one:

* **Project name AND matching identity** — removed.
* **Project name, different identity** — this resource was created from a
  different repo PATH, which is all the hash proves and all the refusal claims.
  Usually that means another checkout; it equally means a directory the operator
  renamed or moved, and the message says both. Reset REFUSES outright
  (:class:`ForeignCheckoutError`), before the plan is confirmed and before
  anything at all is removed, naming that path *when a label records one*.
  Not skipped-with-a-warning: a same-name foreign resource means the operator
  may well be standing in the wrong directory, and continuing would remove
  *this* repo's data on that assumption.
* **Project name, no identity label at all** — NOT removed, and listed as such.
  Labels are applied at CREATE time, so a stack started before OSPREY labelled
  its resources carries none, and nothing can prove whose it is. The remedy
  differs by kind and both are stated where they are printed: a container gets
  its label back the moment something recreates it, but *a named volume takes
  labels only when it is first created and is never relabelled by a later
  deploy*, so an unlabelled volume can only ever be removed by hand.

Images are the one class this scoping cannot cover, and the plan says why.
``<project>:local`` and the persona tags are host-global and derived from the
project name alone: two same-named checkouts do not have one image each, they
share one image. There is no identity label to check because there is no
per-checkout image to put it on. Each candidate tag is instead individually
``image inspect``-verified against its own ``com.osprey.project`` label — the
same check ``nuke`` uses — so a same-named tag belonging to something that is
not an OSPREY deployment is never touched. The residual exposure is bounded and
one-directional: reset reaches image removal only when the identity scan found
no foreign resource under this project name, and what a shared tag's removal
costs another checkout is a rebuild, never data.

EXECUTION SHAPE
===============

Discovery is read-only and happens first, so the plan an operator confirms is
built from what the runtime actually has rather than from what the config
predicts. The plan object that is printed is the same object
:func:`execute_reset` iterates — every removal argv names an entry of it, and it
issues no argv for anything else.

Nothing is re-discovered after the confirmation. Stated precisely, because one
step necessarily re-reads its input: the ``.env`` rewrite has to open the file
again in order to write it, and it is handed the planned key set so that the
re-read decides only WHERE those keys sit, never WHICH keys go. A value minted
between the plan and the confirmation therefore survives — it was never shown,
so it was never agreed to. The rule the whole verb holds to is that the removal
set is fixed at plan time and can only ever shrink afterwards (a resource that
turns out to be already gone), never widen.

    and the ``.env`` rewrite is handed the planned key set rather than re-scanning
    for minted blocks — so the removal set can only shrink between the plan and
    the act (a resource that is already gone), never widen. That is what makes
    "what was printed is what was removed" true even when the runtime's state, or
    the ``.env``, changed underneath in between.

    Order, and why:

    1. ``down`` — stop the stack first, so nothing is holding a volume open and
       nothing writes to ``var/agent_data`` while it is being deleted. A ``down``
       that fails aborts the whole reset before anything is destroyed: a volume

       downstream while masking the real error.
    2. containers, then volumes, then images — dependents before dependencies,

    3. the filesystem: ``var/agent_data``, ``build/`` and the merged compose
       document (and ``var/audit`` under ``--purge-audit``), each removed and —
       for the state directories — left behind empty, so the repo has the shape
       a fresh ``osprey init`` gives it.
