"""Live per-service state for an image build, parsed from BuildKit's own stream.

A cold ``compose build`` runs for a quarter of an hour near-silent: the phase
reporter prints one line when it starts and one when it ends, and everything in
between goes to a spool file. BuildKit's plain-progress stream already carries
what an operator needs to tell that apart from a hang — which service is
working, which step it is on, and what that step is doing right now — so this
module keeps that state instead of discarding it. :mod:`osprey.cli.phase_reporter`
renders the result; nothing here touches a terminal.

:class:`BuildModel` is deliberately a pure model. It owns no thread, no clock
and no I/O: every line arrives through :meth:`BuildModel.feed` with the
timestamp already measured by the caller, which is what makes a fifteen-minute
build replayable from a fixture in milliseconds.

The stream is messier than it looks, and four of its shapes will silently
corrupt a naive parser:

* **Vertex numbers are not unique.** ``compose build`` numbers each service's
  sub-graph independently, so ``#7`` is ``[event-dispatcher 1/8]`` early and
  ``[bluesky-bridge 1/8]`` later. Attribution therefore follows the most recent
  header for a number, not the first one.
* **Headers repeat and steps arrive out of order.** A vertex re-emits its full
  header every time it resumes, and ``[ 2/13]`` can follow ``[ 5/13]``. The step
  index is read from the header; it is never inferred from arrival order.
* **Captions carry embedded carriage returns.** ``dpkg`` and ``pip`` redraw a
  progress line in place, so one physical line holds a dozen overwrites. Only
  the last one was ever visible, and only that one is kept.
* **Most continuation lines are not captions.** Six lines in ten carry either
  BuildKit's elapsed stopwatch (``3.551 Reading package lists...``) or a
  vertex's own status (``DONE 0.0s``, ``sha256:… 249B / 249B``). Passed
  through, they turn the table into a column of ``DONE 0.0s``; the stopwatch is
  stripped and the status lines only prove the service is still alive.

Anything unrecognized is dropped rather than guessed at. A stream with no
BuildKit headers at all — a podman provider with its own progress format —
leaves the model empty, which the renderer reads as "nothing to show" and falls
back to its plain step lines.
