"""Deploy-time project staleness advisory and the build-drift verdict.

``osprey build`` stamps provenance into ``.osprey-manifest.json`` — the
osprey version that rendered the project and a content hash of the resolved
preset/profile (``creation.preset_hash``). This module reads that provenance
back when the project is *deployed* and warns when the render predates the
installed framework or preset, with the exact rebuild command as the remedy.

Rationale: a rendered project is a generated artifact. Its ``config.yml``
self-describes what to deploy, so a stale render deploys "successfully" while
silently missing every service the preset gained since — with no error
anywhere. Every other drift check in the codebase renders *from*
``config.yml`` and therefore cannot see this; the comparison here is against
the installed preset instead.

Two readings of the same provenance live here, and they differ in severity:

- :func:`staleness_reasons` / :func:`warn_if_project_stale` — the legacy
  advisory over a rendered project directory. Warns loudly, never fails, and
  fails open: a project without a manifest deploys silently.
- :func:`check_drift` — the deployment-repo verdict the lifecycle verbs act
  on. ``up``/``restart`` refuse on it, ``status`` prints it, ``chat``/``query``
  warn on it. Here "cannot compare" is *not* silence: a build whose profile no
  longer parses, or which carries no fingerprint at all, is reported as
  ``UNRESOLVABLE`` so a start verb refuses rather than guessing. ``--as-built``
  is the documented escape from both refusals — ``build/`` is self-contained,
  so starting it as rendered stays a valid, knowing choice.

Both read the *same* fingerprint: ``compute_profile_hash`` over the resolved
profile document, the file material it names, and the host-variant overlay
``.env.variant`` selects, plus the ``creation.osprey_version`` stamp. The
variant is part of it because the overlay is part of what was rendered: without
it, editing the selected ``profiles/<host>.yml`` — or pointing the setting at a
different one — would leave ``build/`` reading CLEAN while it holds the render
of an overlay nobody is using any more. There is deliberately no second hash
mechanism — the per-key digests :func:`profile_fingerprint` derives are
diagnostic only, used to *name* what changed, never to decide whether
anything did.

    """Decide whether a deployment repo's ``build/`` still matches its source.

    The comparison recomputes the profile fingerprint now and holds it against
    the one ``osprey build`` stamped into the build manifest. Both sides come
    from the same machinery, so the answer is about content, not about
    timestamps, file order, or comments.

    Unlike the legacy advisory in this module, this does **not** fail open. A
    profile that no longer resolves, and a build that carries no fingerprint,
    are both ``UNRESOLVABLE``: silently starting a stack nobody can vouch for
    is the failure mode the refusal exists to prevent. ``--as-built`` remains
    the operator's way through, since ``build/`` is self-contained.

    Args:
        repo_root: The deployment repo root — the directory holding
            ``profile.yml``, ``build/`` and ``var/``.

    Returns:
        A report every lifecycle verb can act on; never raises.
