"""Dev-wheel artifact helpers: build, per-process cache, staging copy, and manifest.

A ``--dev`` deploy installs a locally-built osprey wheel into container build
contexts instead of the released PyPI pin. This module owns that wheel's whole
lifecycle: building it at most once per process
(:func:`_build_dev_wheel_cached`), caching the build across the many contexts a
single deploy stages (:data:`_wheel_build_cache`), copying it into a context
alongside its base-requirements manifest
(:func:`_copy_local_framework_for_override`,
:func:`_write_local_requirements_manifest`), and enumerating what staging added
so callers can clean up exactly that (:func:`_staged_dev_artifact_paths`).

The per-context *decision* to stage — gated on ``--dev`` and the presence of a
``Dockerfile`` — stays in :mod:`osprey.deployment.compose_generator`
(``_stage_dev_wheel_for_context``), where it is wired into the compose render
flow; that module re-exports the copy and cache-reset helpers below so existing
import and monkeypatch call sites keep resolving against it.

    This function builds a wheel package from the local osprey source and copies it

    copying source files, as it properly handles package structure and avoids namespace
    collisions with other packages.

    The wheel is built using the standard Python build process and can be installed
    in containers to override the PyPI version during development and testing.
    The build itself runs at most once per process (see
