    a literal here is a second, silent spelling of the same setting, and a

    ``base_dir`` names the same absolute path on both sides and must NOT be
    re-anchored under the project directory; a template-level
    ``{{ dir }}/{{ base }}`` concatenation cannot make that distinction.

    Known limit: a ``~``-relative ``base_dir`` is anchored here like any other
    relative path, while ``anchored_path`` expands it against the container's
    ``HOME`` — which the compose template sets to ``/data/claude-config``. Such
    a project's agent data therefore lands in the claude-config volume rather
    than the agent-data one: misfiled, but persisted by the claude-config volume,
    so this is not the unbacked-directory data loss above (the agent-data volume
    then mounts over an empty ``~`` directory and holds nothing). Left unhandled rather
    than expanded here because resolving it would mean spelling that ``HOME``
    path a second time in this module, free to drift from the template that

            — no assumption that ``config`` is a particular schema/dataclass type).

            with no clock/random/filesystem inputs — which is why the digest below
            arrives as a parameter instead of being read from disk here.
        auth_env_digest: sha256 hex digest of ``.env.auth``'s current content,
            emitted as the :data:`AUTH_ENV_DIGEST_LABEL` label on the auth
            sidecar's service so a content change becomes a service-DEFINITION
            change — the one recreate trigger every compose implementation
            honours. The deploy path computes it via
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.artifacts.write_web_terminal_artifacts`;
            ``None`` (the default, and the ``osprey scaffold web-terminals
            render`` path, which has no project root to digest) emits no label —
            harmless, because every ``osprey up`` re-renders through the
            artifacts seam with a current digest before its ``up``, so a
            label-less render can never reach a running stack stale.
        dispatcher_personas: Persona names whose project declares the EVENTS
            panel, and whose users therefore need the event dispatcher's bearer
            token. Resolved from disk by
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.personas_needing_dispatcher_token`
            and passed in for the same reason ``auth_env_digest`` is: this
            function reads no filesystem. Each such user gets
            ``EVENT_DISPATCHER_TOKEN`` in its OWN ``environment:`` block,
            interpolated by compose from the deploy ``.env`` — never written
            into this rendered artifact, and never into the shared
            ``.env.users``, which every user's container reads (see
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.env_production._build_env_production_subset`).
            That split IS the tier boundary: a read-only persona must not hold a
            credential that can fire triggers. ``None`` (the default, and the
            ``osprey scaffold web-terminals render`` path, which has no project
            root to resolve against) emits no token line at all.
        ariel_personas: Persona names whose project configures ARIEL, and whose
            users therefore need the Postgres password ``osprey up`` minted into
            the deploy ``.env`` (see
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.personas_needing_ariel_password`).
            Same placement and same reason as ``dispatcher_personas``: both ARIEL
            consumers inside the container — the panel's server and the ``ariel``
            MCP server — resolve their DSN through
            :func:`osprey.services.ariel_search.config.resolve_ariel_dsn`, which
            reads ``ARIEL_DB_PASSWORD`` from the environment and otherwise falls
            back to the shipped default, so a container that never receives it
            authenticates with the wrong password against a Postgres initialized
            with the minted one. ``None`` emits no line.
        launch_token_personas: Persona names entitled to arm a Bluesky queue
            start, resolved from disk by
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.personas_needing_launch_token`.
            Same placement and same reason as ``dispatcher_personas`` — see that
            argument for why a per-persona credential belongs in the per-user
            ``environment:`` block and never in the shared ``.env.users``.
            The tier boundary bites hardest here: ``BLUESKY_LAUNCH_TOKEN`` is
            what lets the ``bluesky`` MCP server arm a queue start without a
            second confirmation, so a read-only persona holding it would be able
            to move hardware. ``None`` emits no line.
        facility_bundle_personas: Persona names whose project names a
            ``facility_knowledge.bundle_path``, and whose container therefore
            gets the deployment's knowledge bundle bind-mounted (see
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.personas_needing_facility_bundle`).
            Resolved from disk and passed in for the same reason the credential
            sets are. Unlike them this grants a MOUNT rather than a secret, so it
            is not a tier boundary: the bundle is the same corpus every entitled
            persona reads, and the tier that matters for it is decided by what
            the agent inside is allowed to write. ``None`` emits no mount for
            any user.
        facility_bundle_gid: Group id of the bundle directory on the host,
            resolved from disk by
            :func:`osprey.deployment.compose_generator.shared_corpus_gid` and
            emitted as ``group_add:`` on every entitled service. This is the
            half of the sharing story that setgid alone cannot supply: the
            directory's setgid bit decides which group new files are OWNED by,
            but a container's process is a MEMBER of only the groups its image
            gives it, so without this the group bits grant nothing and access
            holds only where the deploying user's uid happens to equal the
            image's — an accident that breaks on any other host. ``None`` (the
            directory does not exist yet, or a platform with no gids) emits no
            ``group_add``, which is the honest render rather than a guessed
            group.

    Returns:
        Mapping of output-relative-path to rendered content, for exactly three
        artifacts: ``docker-compose.web.yml``, ``nginx/nginx.conf``, and
        ``nginx/landing.html``.

    ``localStorage``. So its palette is resolved here, at render time, and baked
    into the page:

    - ``web.theme`` naming a **family** (``"desy"``) yields TWO blocks: that
      family's dark values under ``:root``, and its light values under a
      ``prefers-color-scheme: light`` media query. Light/dark then follows each
      viewer's OS, which is the same thing the terminals behind this page do
      when configured with a bare family.
    - ``web.theme`` naming a **concrete id** (``"desy-light"``) yields ONE
      block and no media query — the deployment pinned a mode, and the landing
      page honors that pin exactly as the terminals do.

    ``{type: "users"}`` auto-populates one card per configured user, using the
    relative ``/u/<user>/`` path that nginx.conf.j2 (bind-nginx-reverse-proxy)
    reverse-proxies to that user's loopback upstream — so, unlike ``landing_url``,
    no deploy-host needs baking into the landing cards themselves. When a user
    resolves to a persona (:func:`resolve_personas` returns a non-``None``
    ``persona``), that card also carries an optional ``sublabel`` holding the
    persona name, shown as a secondary badge on the card; users with no persona
    in effect (every bare-string roster) omit the key entirely, so
    landing.html.j2's ``{% if item["sublabel"] %}`` guard renders them without
    one. ``{type: "links", label, links}`` passes ``links`` straight through as
    ``items`` (link cards never carry a ``sublabel``). Unrecognized/malformed
    group entries are dropped rather than raising: lint is the authoritative
    gate on schema well-formedness, this is just the render-time adapter.

    **One ``users`` entry can expand to more than one section.** A roster is not
    always a list of people: a deployment may also run a standalone service
    behind its own login — an ARIEL logbook terminal beside the operators, say.
    Those belong under their own heading rather than mixed in with the staff, so
    a persona may declare ``landing_group: <heading>`` in the catalog
    (:func:`resolve_personas` carries it onto each of its users). Users carrying
    one are lifted out of the default section into a section of that name,
    emitted after it in first-appearance roster order, and marked
    ``variant: "tray"`` — the cue landing.html.j2 renders as an accent-edged
    panel, so the page reads as people on top, services below. Everything else
    about those users is untouched; this is presentation only.

    ``{type: "users"}`` also takes an optional ``label`` overriding the default
    ``"Terminals"`` heading on the section that keeps the ungrouped users, so a
    deployment that splits its roster can name both halves. Sections other than
    the default never carry ``variant``, so a config that declares no
