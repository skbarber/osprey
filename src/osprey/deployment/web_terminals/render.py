#: block, since a facility serving the standard port should not have to
#: configure one. A host that cannot bind 443 — unprivileged, or already
#: carrying another deployment's perimeter — names its own port instead, and
#: every consumer of the seam follows the ``tls_port`` value
#: :func:`_auth_tls_context` derives: both ``listen`` lines, the cleartext
#: redirect, the external origin the IdP is registered against and the
#: perimeter deny-list. Defined here, beside the render that stamps it, and
#: imported by ``lint`` for its port-collision check — never restated there,
#: since two spellings of one default is exactly how a collision check comes to
#: reserve a port the template does not use.
TLS_LISTEN_PORT = 443

#: The port the ``https`` scheme itself implies, which a URL therefore omits.
#: Spelled apart from :data:`TLS_LISTEN_PORT` even though both are 443 today:
#: that one is this framework's default for an unset ``tls.port`` and is a
#: choice, while this one is what the scheme means and cannot be chosen.
#: Collapsing them would let a change to the default silently rewrite every

#: The authentication methods this deployment can actually serve: ``none``
#: (open — every terminal is navigation-only, nginx vouches for every request),

#: through its own ``?token=`` magic link), ``password`` (OSPREY-managed scrypt
#: hashes) and ``oidc`` (Authlib client against a facility IdP). Anything else
#: is a hard config error rather than a forward-compatible passthrough — nginx
#: would emit the ``auth_request`` seam against a sidecar that cannot answer for
#: that method, which does fail closed but only as an unactionable 403 on every
#: request. Consumers never compare against these names: they read the derived
#: booleans :func:`_auth_tls_context` returns beside ``auth_method``.
SUPPORTED_AUTH_METHODS = ("none", "token", "password", "oidc")

#: Layout slot the auth sidecar listens on when ``auth.port`` is unset. It sits
#: in the gateway tier, one above nginx and far below the per-user families
#: (which start a hundred ports up and grow with the roster), so a default-port
#: sidecar can't collide with user N's terminal; lint joins the effective value
#: into its port-collision check. Resolved per deployment rather than pinned
#: here — see :func:`_auth_tls_context`'s ``base``.
_AUTH_PORT_SLOT = "auth"

#: The auth sidecar's audit identity — the subdirectory of ``var/audit/`` it
#: binds and writes its login and denial events to. A FIXED name, unlike every
#: other identity in this file: the sidecar is one service, not a per-user one,
#: and the users its records name are their SUBJECTS rather than their writers.
#: Never a roster username, which is exactly why a user literally named
#: ``sidecar`` collides with it — that user's terminal would bind the same host
#: directory the sidecar writes its login events into, read-write. The render
#: refuses the collision outright (:func:`_check_roster_audit_identities`), and

#: (``web_terminals.reserved_audit_identity``).
AUTH_SIDECAR_AUDIT_IDENTITY = "sidecar"

#: like a persona has — but its records still live at ``var/audit/<identity>``
#: under its own root, so one shape describes every writer in the deployment.
_AUTH_SIDECAR_CONTAINER_ROOT = "/app"

#: keys, as in the service templates' ``osprey.project.name``). Compose bakes
#: ``env_file`` content into a container at CREATION time, and a
#: service-definition change is the only recreate trigger every compose
#: implementation honours — podman-compose in particular never recreates on a
#: content-only file change. Stamping the digest into the definition turns an

#: runs whatever ``auth.method`` says, and ``_validate_usernames`` gates it), so
#: on that path this rule is the looser of two and never the one that refuses.
#: It is kept separate because ``render_web_terminals`` is also called with no
#: mint behind it — by lint, by tests, by any caller passing
#: ``terminal_secrets`` for a roster it did not provision — and what turning a
#: name into a FILE makes newly dangerous is narrower than what makes it a bad
#: identity: a name that stops being one path component, ``../`` escaping the

#: ``-`` to ``_``, so ``alice.b`` would derive ``OSPREY_TERMINAL_SECRET_ALICE.B``.

#: the reference, leaves it in the snippet verbatim, and nginx refuses to start

    The substitution is QUOTED, which decides how a blank variable fails. envsubst

    a literal here is a second, silent spelling of the same setting, and a

    The join happens here rather than in the template because an absolute
    ``base_dir`` names the same absolute path on both sides and must NOT be
    re-anchored under the project directory; a template-level
    ``{{ dir }}/{{ base }}`` concatenation cannot make that distinction.

    Known limit: a ``~``-relative ``base_dir`` is anchored here like any other
    relative path, while ``anchored_path`` expands it against the container's
    ``HOME`` — which the compose template sets to ``/data/claude-config``. Such
    a project's agent data therefore lands in the claude-config volume rather
    than the agent-data one: misfiled, but persisted by the claude-config volume,
    so this is not the unbacked-directory data loss above (the agent-data volume
    then mounts over an empty ``~`` directory and holds nothing). Left unhandled rather
    than expanded here because resolving it would mean spelling that ``HOME``
    path a second time in this module, free to drift from the template that

            Deterministic: the same inputs always render the same three artifacts,
            with no clock/random/filesystem inputs — which is why the digest below
            arrives as a parameter instead of being read from disk here.
        auth_env_digest: sha256 hex digest of ``.env.auth``'s current content,
            emitted as the :data:`AUTH_ENV_DIGEST_LABEL` label on the auth
            sidecar's service so a content change becomes a service-DEFINITION

            harmless, because every ``osprey up`` re-renders through the
            artifacts seam with a current digest before its ``up``, so a
            label-less render can never reach a running stack stale.
        dispatcher_personas: Persona names whose project declares the EVENTS
            panel, and whose users therefore need the event dispatcher's bearer
            token. Resolved from disk by
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.personas_needing_dispatcher_token`
            and passed in for the same reason ``auth_env_digest`` is: this

            ``EVENT_DISPATCHER_TOKEN`` in its OWN ``environment:`` block,
            interpolated by compose from the deploy ``.env`` — never written
            into this rendered artifact, and never into the shared
            ``.env.users``, which every user's container reads (see
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.env_production._build_env_production_subset`).
            That split IS the tier boundary: a read-only persona must not hold a
            credential that can fire triggers. ``None`` (the default, and the
            ``osprey scaffold web-terminals render`` path, which has no project
            root to resolve against) emits no token line at all.
        ariel_personas: Persona names whose project configures ARIEL, and whose
            users therefore need the Postgres password ``osprey up`` minted into
            the deploy ``.env`` (see
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.personas_needing_ariel_password`).
            Same placement and same reason as ``dispatcher_personas``: both ARIEL
            consumers inside the container — the panel's server and the ``ariel``
            MCP server — resolve their DSN through
            :func:`osprey.services.ariel_search.config.resolve_ariel_dsn`, which
            reads ``ARIEL_DB_PASSWORD`` from the environment and otherwise falls
            back to the shipped default, so a container that never receives it
            authenticates with the wrong password against a Postgres initialized
            with the minted one. ``None`` emits no line.
        launch_token_personas: ``{lane: persona names}`` — which personas are
            entitled to arm a queue start on which plan lane, resolved from disk
            by
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.personas_needing_launch_token_by_lane`.
            Same placement and same reason as ``dispatcher_personas`` — see that
            argument for why a per-persona credential belongs in the per-user
            ``environment:`` block and never in the shared ``.env.users``.
            Keyed by lane because each lane is a whole bridge stack armed by its
            own ``<PREFIX>_LAUNCH_TOKEN``: a deployment whose baseline is a live
            machine arms its virtual-accelerator lane alone, and a persona
            entitled there must not also hold the live lane's token. The tier
            boundary bites hardest here: the token is what lets the ``bluesky``
            MCP server arm a queue start without a second confirmation, so a
            read-only persona holding it would be able to move hardware. A lane
            no persona may arm is absent from the map (an empty set grants the
            same nothing). ``None`` emits no line for any user.
        graphdb_personas: Persona names whose project configures a graph store,
            and whose users therefore need the Neo4j password ``osprey up``
            minted into the deploy ``.env`` (see
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.personas_needing_graphdb_password`).
            Same placement and same reason as ``dispatcher_personas``: the
            consumer is the ``graph`` MCP server inside the container, which
            resolves what to dial and with which password through
            :func:`osprey.deployment.graphdb_service.resolve_graphdb_connection`
            — that reads ``GRAPHDB_PASSWORD`` from the environment and otherwise
            falls back to the shipped default, so a container that never
            receives it authenticates with the wrong password against a store
            initialized with the minted one, and every graph query fails on
            auth. Unlike ``launch_token_personas`` this set is not a tier
            boundary: Neo4j has one write-capable account, and read-only-ness is
            enforced by that server's read transactions rather than by which
            persona holds the credential. ``None`` emits no line.
        facility_bundle_personas: Persona names whose project names a
            ``facility_knowledge.bundle_path``, and whose container therefore
            gets the deployment's knowledge bundle bind-mounted (see
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.personas_needing_facility_bundle`).
            Resolved from disk and passed in for the same reason the credential
            sets are. Unlike them this grants a MOUNT rather than a secret, so it
            is not a tier boundary: the bundle is the same corpus every entitled
            persona reads, and the tier that matters for it is decided by what
            the agent inside is allowed to write. ``None`` emits no mount for
            any user.
        facility_bundle_gid: Group id of the bundle directory on the host,
            resolved from disk by
            :func:`osprey.deployment.compose_generator.shared_corpus_gid` and
            emitted as ``group_add:`` on every entitled service. Setgid decides
            which group new files are OWNED by, not which groups a process
            belongs to, so membership has to be granted separately, and this
            gid is the RUNTIME half of that grant — it reaches the container's
            INITIAL process. In a framework-built image the membership the
            serving process keeps comes from the entrypoint's own root-phase
            ``/etc/group`` join for ``OSPREY_FACILITY_BUNDLE_DIR`` instead,
            because ``gosu`` re-derives supplementary groups from that file for
            the target user and discards whatever the runtime granted. The
            runtime half is what carries access where that join never runs: a
            container started with ``--user`` takes the entrypoint's non-root
            branch, which skips both the join and the drop, as does any image
            started without this framework's entrypoint at all. ``None`` (the
            directory does not exist yet, or a platform with no gids) emits no
            ``group_add``, which is the honest render rather than a guessed
            group.
        ariel_mirror_personas: Persona names whose project runs an ARIEL qmd
            export that writes a mirror, and whose container therefore gets the
            deployment's mirror directory bind-mounted at the path its own
            exporter writes (see
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.personas_needing_ariel_mirror`).
            Same placement and same reason as ``facility_bundle_personas``:
            a mount, not a secret, resolved from disk and passed in. Without it
            an entry enhanced inside that container is written into the
            container's writable layer — never indexed by the sidecar, gone at
            the next recreate. ``None`` emits no mount for any user.
        ariel_mirror_gid: Group id of the mirror directory on the host, for
            the same ``group_add:`` reason as ``facility_bundle_gid``. ``None``
            emits no group for it.
        archiver_password_personas: ``{persona_name: env_var_name}`` for the
            personas whose archiver connector authenticates with a password,
            resolved from disk by
            :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.personas_needing_archiver_password`.
            Same placement and same reason as ``dispatcher_personas``; a map
            rather than a set because the connector reads the variable its own
            ``archiver.<type>.password_env`` names, and the line emitted into
            the user's ``environment:`` block carries exactly that name (the
            control-assistant preset spells it ``MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD``, which
            ``osprey up`` mints). Without it the agent's every archiver read
            fails with "Environment variable '…' is not set" while the same
            project works on the single-user host path, which reads the whole
            deploy ``.env``. ``None`` emits no line.
        terminal_secrets: ``{username: operator secret}`` as provisioned into
            the deploy ``.env``, resolved from disk and passed in for the same
            reason ``auth_env_digest`` is. Supplying it adds one
            ``nginx/templates/secret-<user>.conf.template`` to the returned
            mapping (see :data:`NGINX_TEMPLATES_OUTPUT_DIR`) for each roster
            user whose location INJECTS one — the only ones an ``include`` ever
            reads (see :func:`_terminal_secret_artifacts`); the three artifacts
            render byte-identically either way. **Only the keys are used.** A value is read solely to refuse an absent one — no
            secret value enters any rendered artifact, which is why the snippet
            is an nginx *template* naming
            :func:`terminal_secret_env_var`'s variable rather than a rendered
            conf holding the secret. ``None`` (the default, and the ``osprey
            scaffold web-terminals render`` path, which has no deploy ``.env``
            to read) emits no snippets at all: the render stays exactly what it
            was before this carrier existed. The per-service variable NAME and
            external origin are threaded on every render regardless — neither is
            a secret, and the compose reference resolves to empty when the
            deploy ``.env`` holds nothing.

    Returns:
        Mapping of output-relative-path to rendered content: the three artifacts
        ``docker-compose.web.yml``, ``nginx/nginx.conf`` and
        ``nginx/landing.html``, plus — only when ``terminal_secrets`` is
        supplied — one ``nginx/templates/secret-<user>.conf.template`` per
        roster user whose location injects one. The write seam clears that directory
        first (see
        :func:`clear_nginx_templates_dir`), so a decommissioned user's snippet
        cannot survive a re-render.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``modules.web_terminals.nginx_port`` is set to something
            that is not an int (an unset one resolves to the layout's gateway
            slot), if a configured user can't resolve a full port-family set, if

      family's dark values under ``:root``, and its light values under a

      viewer's OS, which is the same thing the terminals behind this page do
      when configured with a bare family.
    - ``web.theme`` naming a **concrete id** (``"desy-light"``) yields ONE
      block and no media query — the deployment pinned a mode, and the landing
      page honors that pin exactly as the terminals do.

    """Build the one origin every absolute URL this deployment emits is derived from.

    Three consumers need an absolute URL that a browser will actually resolve:
    the landing link baked into each container (:func:`_landing_url`), the auth
    sidecar's OIDC ``redirect_uri``, and the ``OSPREY_TERMINAL_EXTERNAL_ORIGIN``
    each per-user app checks a mutating request's ``Origin`` against. All three
    must agree exactly — an IdP rejects a ``redirect_uri`` that isn't
    character-for-character the registered one, a landing link on a different
    origin would drop the session cookie, and an ``Origin`` that does not match
    is refused — so they come from here rather than being assembled three times.

    ``modules.web_terminals.external_origin`` WINS when set, and is returned
    verbatim. It exists because the derivation below describes only the topology
    where a browser talks to THIS nginx directly. A facility load balancer or
    ingress proxy terminating TLS in front of it (the shape
    ``auth.allow_insecure_http`` is documented for) is a supported deployment in
    which the browser's origin is the front terminator's — a different host, and
    usually a different scheme — and nothing derivable from this config can name
    it. Without the override every write from such a deployment is refused while
    the pages themselves load, which reads as a broken app rather than as a
    configuration gap.

    Otherwise the origin is derived. Scheme and port follow ``tls.enabled``:
    with TLS on, the TLS server is the sole content server (the plain listener
    only redirects to it), so the origin is ``https`` on ``tls.port``. The
    default 443 is left implicit — both the canonical origin serialization and
    the form an IdP client registration is normally written in — while any other
    ``tls.port`` is spelled out, because a browser reaching a non-default port
    sends it in the ``Origin`` header and an IdP would reject a
    ``redirect_uri`` that omitted it. With TLS off the origin is plain HTTP on
    the published ``nginx_port``. A default port left explicit here is not a
    mismatch: both ends of the ``Origin`` check normalize it away
    (:func:`osprey.interfaces.common_middleware._normalize_origin`).

    The derived host comes from ``deploy.fqdn``: the schema documents that field
    as reachable from developers' laptops (used in client-mode profiles),
    whereas ``deploy.host`` is only guaranteed SSH-resolvable (may be a bare
    `~/.ssh/config` alias, not a browser-reachable hostname).

        root: The parsed facility config (``modules.web_terminals.external_origin``
            and ``deploy.fqdn`` are read).

            no origin is configured.

    relative ``/u/<user>/`` path that nginx.conf.j2 (bind-nginx-reverse-proxy)
    reverse-proxies to that user's loopback upstream — so, unlike ``landing_url``,
    no deploy-host needs baking into the landing cards themselves. When a user
    resolves to a persona (:func:`resolve_personas` returns a non-``None``
    ``persona``), that card also carries an optional ``sublabel`` holding the

    in effect (every bare-string roster) omit the key entirely, so
    landing.html.j2's ``{% if item["sublabel"] %}`` guard renders them without
    one. Every user card also carries ``token_login`` (see :func:`_user_card`),
    the auth posture that user's terminal is entered under.
    ``{type: "links", label, links}`` passes ``links`` straight through as

    group entries are dropped rather than raising: lint is the authoritative
    gate on schema well-formedness, this is just the render-time adapter.

    **One ``users`` entry can expand to more than one section.** A roster is not
    always a list of people: a deployment may also run a standalone service
    behind its own login — an ARIEL logbook terminal beside the operators, say.
    Those belong under their own heading rather than mixed in with the staff, so
    a persona may declare ``landing_group: <heading>`` in the catalog
    (:func:`resolve_personas` carries it onto each of its users). Users carrying
    one are lifted out of the default section into a section of that name,
    emitted after it in first-appearance roster order, and marked
    ``variant: "tray"`` — the cue landing.html.j2 renders as an accent-edged
    panel, so the page reads as people on top, services below. Everything else
    about those users is untouched; this is presentation only.

    ``{type: "users"}`` also takes an optional ``label`` overriding the default
    ``"Terminals"`` heading on the section that keeps the ungrouped users, so a
    deployment that splits its roster can name both halves. Sections other than
    the default never carry ``variant``, so a config that declares no

    keys the nginx seam and the auth sidecar's compose service consume.

    This is the single place ``modules.web_terminals.auth`` is parsed: the nginx
    template, the compose overlay and the lint rules all read the keys returned
    here rather than the raw config, so there is one definition of what an
    ``auth`` stanza means. **This function renders nothing** — it derives values;
    the templates turn ``tls_enabled``/``tls_port``/``auth_method`` into the
    actual `listen <tls_port> ssl` / `auth_request` directives.

    Both stanzas remain entirely optional. ``tls`` defaults to off; ``auth``
    defaults to ``token``, today's magic-link posture. Every value is read defensively (wrong-typed entries
    fall back to their default, as everywhere else in this module — lint is the
    authoritative gate on schema well-formedness) with one exception: an
    ``auth.method`` string naming a method that does not exist raises, because
    the resulting deployment would emit an auth seam nothing can answer.

    The four methods and what they mean:

    * ``none`` — OPEN, navigation-only. Everyone who can reach nginx is
      trusted; nginx vouches for every request to a non-exempt terminal by
      injecting that user's terminal secret, so the landing page needs no
      login and no token. No sidecar.
    * ``token`` — the DEFAULT. No login wall and no sidecar; nginx injects
      nothing, so each terminal's own ``?token=`` -> cookie exchange is the one
      gate and a browser passes it once per user via the minted login URL.
    * ``password`` / ``oidc`` — a login wall: the auth sidecar answers every
      ``auth_request`` and nginx injects the secret only behind it.

    Every consumer decides on the derived booleans below rather than on the
    method name, so a new method cannot fork a branch somebody forgot:

    * ``sidecar_active`` — a sidecar service is rendered and every non-exempt
      location carries an ``auth_request`` (``password``/``oidc``).
    * ``inject_secret`` — nginx injects the per-user terminal secret on
      non-exempt locations (``password``/``oidc``/``none``; NOT ``token``).
    * ``walled`` — a login wall stands in front of the roster. Identical to
      ``sidecar_active``; spelled separately because its readers ask a
      different question (who has a login) than the sidecar's do.
    * ``token_exchange`` — the browser reaches every terminal through the
      per-user magic link (``token`` only).
    * ``open_perimeter`` — nginx vouches for every non-exempt terminal with no
      wall in front of it (``none`` only). Derived here rather than recombined
      as ``inject_secret and not sidecar_active`` by each reader, because it is
      the posture the perimeter stamp, the egress deploy gate and the lint rule
      all key on and a second spelling of it is a second thing to get wrong.

    Args:
        web_terminals: The already-unwrapped ``modules.web_terminals`` dict (as
            passed to :func:`render_web_terminals`'s Jinja contexts).
        base: The port base this deployment resolved, from
            :func:`osprey.port_layout.resolve_port_base`. Only consulted when
            ``auth.port`` is unset, in which case the sidecar takes the ``auth``

            default base, which is right only for the callers that read the
            derived booleans and never look at ``auth_port`` at all.

    Returns:

        :data:`SUPPORTED_AUTH_METHODS`, defaults to ``"token"``), the derived
        booleans
        ``sidecar_active``/``inject_secret``/``walled``/``token_exchange``/``open_perimeter``

    ``roles`` is the static half and applies in every auth posture: a roster
    entry's ``role:`` (carried through by
    :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.normalize_users`) names one
    of these, and the role names the catalog persona that entry runs as.
    ``claims`` is the OIDC half: it names the ID-token claim carrying group
    membership and maps that claim's VALUES onto the same role names.

    An absent stanza — which is every deployment written before roles existed —
    parses to the inert defaults (no roles, no claim, empty map). That is what
    keeps ``none``/``password``/``oidc``-without-claims deployments rendering
    exactly as they did.

    Wrong-typed containers are read defensively (a non-mapping
    ``authorization``, ``roles`` or ``claims`` becomes empty, as everywhere else
    in this module — lint is the authoritative gate on schema well-formedness),
    and a non-string role name is dropped rather than parsed, since no roster
    entry or claim value can name it. Three inputs raise instead, because each
    would bind a privilege SILENTLY WRONG rather than merely render an odd
    artifact:

    * **A role that names no persona.** Every entry carrying that role would
      fall back to the deployment's default persona — a different privilege set
      than the operator wrote, with nothing said about the substitution.
    * **A claim map entry that cannot name a declared role** (an undeclared
      name, or a key/value of a type no login can ever match). The mapping is
      dead config: a login the operator believes carries that role does not.
    * **Half a ``claims`` stanza** — a claim with no map, or a map with no
      claim. Neither half resolves anything on its own.

    What deliberately does NOT raise here: role-name charset and ``$``-bearing
    values are lint's (``web_terminals.invalid_role_charset``,
    ``web_terminals.authorization_unsafe_value``), and a role naming a persona
    that is not in the catalog is reported by lint's existing unknown-persona
    rule once the role resolves to one.

    Args:
        web_terminals: The already-unwrapped ``modules.web_terminals`` dict (as
            passed to :func:`render_web_terminals`'s Jinja contexts).

    Returns:
        A dict with three keys, all present whether or not the stanza is:

        ``authorization_roles``
            ``{role name: persona name}``, in declaration order; empty when no
            roles are declared. THE table the shared persona helper reads.
        ``authorization_claim``
            The ID-token claim name carrying group membership, or ``None`` when
            the deployment maps no claim.
        ``authorization_claim_map``
            ``{claim value: role name}``, every value naming a key of
            ``authorization_roles``; empty when no claim is mapped. Resolution
            INTERSECTS a login's claim values with this table's keys and fails
            closed on an empty or ambiguous intersection — never
            first-match-wins — so this table's iteration order carries no
            meaning.

        The returned tables are always new objects: no consumer can edit the
        deployment's config through the table it was handed.

    Two ways a name breaks it, both refused here:

    Scope, stated because the neighbouring gate's is different: this one is
