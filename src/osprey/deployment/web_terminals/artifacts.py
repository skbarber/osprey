"""Render-and-write seam for the multi-user web-terminal deployment artifacts.

:func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.render.render_web_terminals` produces the
three artifacts in memory (``docker-compose.web.yml``, ``nginx/nginx.conf``,
``nginx/landing.html``) as a ``{relative_path: content}`` mapping. This module is
the single place that decides *where on disk* those relative paths land, so every
consumer agrees on one location:

* ``osprey up`` renders and writes them at bring-up, then includes the web
  compose file in the ``compose up`` invocation.
* the lifecycle verbs (``decommission``/``prune``) re-render and re-write them after
  editing the roster, so the deployed nginx routing and compose services match the
  new roster.

If bring-up and the lifecycle verbs wrote to different directories, a decommission
would update artifacts that ``up`` never reads. Routing every writer through this
one helper makes that class of drift impossible.

class BashLaunchTokenConflictError(DeploymentError):
    """A persona would hold ``BLUESKY_LAUNCH_TOKEN`` while its agent may run a shell.

    ``BLUESKY_LAUNCH_TOKEN`` exists so a single chat approval is enough to arm a
    Bluesky queue start, which is physical accelerator hardware motion. That
    approval gates the ``queue_start`` MCP tool — and only that tool. An agent
    that may also run ``Bash`` can read the token straight out of its own
    environment and arm the queue with a plain HTTP call, reaching the same
    hardware with no approval prompt at any point. The chat gate is then
    decoration.

    So the two are refused *together* rather than shipped and documented: the
    deploy stops before a single web-terminal artifact is written, while the
    operator still has the context to fix it. Fail-closed, like
    :class:`~osprey.deployment.errors.ComposeInterpolationError` and for the same
    reason — a warning about this would scroll past and leave a stack running.

    Deliberately not a ``ValueError``. ``force_recreate_auth_sidecar`` catches
    ``(ValueError, OSError)`` around its best-effort re-render and downgrades it
    to a warning; a safety refusal that a credential rotation could swallow is
    not a refusal.

    Three boundaries this guard does **not** cover, none of them accidental:

    * **Persona-less roster entries are out of reach.** Both sides of the
      intersection are keyed on persona names, so a roster entry naming no
      persona — the zero-migration path, where the web image *is* the deploy
      project — appears in neither set and is not bound by this check.
      :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.render.render_web_terminals`
      answers that entry's entitlement independently, via
      :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.config_needs_launch_token`
      on the deploy config itself. This is consistent with the feature's scope:
      the single-user path already resolves this token today, so it is not new
      exposure — but a reader who assumes the guard covers every entitled
      container will be wrong.
    * **The check is render-scoped, not image-scoped.** It reads the rendered
      project directory, which equals the image's ``.claude/settings.json`` only
      as of that image's last build: ``COPY . /app/<project>/`` bakes the
      directory in, and the per-user compose services declare only ``image:``,
      with no ``build:`` stanza to rebuild one at start. A render that *adds* a
      ``Bash`` deny without an image rebuild therefore passes this guard while
      the running image is still permissive. That is why the remedy below says
      rebuild, not merely "restore the deny".
    * **It assumes the agent does not run in bypass-permissions mode.** An agent
      launched with permissions bypassed ignores its deny list wholesale, and a
      ``Bash`` deny then proves nothing. No such flag appears anywhere on the
      web-terminal launch path today, so the assumption holds — but nothing here
      would fail if a future change broke it.

    Args:
        personas: The offending persona names — every persona that is both
            entitled to the launch token and shipping a settings artifact that
            does not deny ``Bash``. All of them are named in the message; an
            operator fixing one at a time would otherwise redeploy once per
            offender to discover the next.

    The whole guard in one callable, because it runs at **three** points and the
    three must never be able to disagree about what a conflict is:

    * :func:`preflight_web_terminals` — the fail-fast gate. Refusing there is what
      keeps a conflicted deploy from paying for the minutes-long project-image
      build, the archiver/ARIEL store staging, and the minting *and printing* of
      ``.env.users`` and auth credentials for a stack that will never come up.
      That last part is the property ``preflight_web_terminals``' own docstring
      commits to, so the check belongs ahead of :func:`ensure_env_production`.
    * :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.lifecycle.decommission_user` — ahead
      of its ``config_replace_list`` roster edit. The seam below would refuse this
      path anyway, but only *after* the roster edit had been written, leaving
      ``config.yml`` updated, the artifacts stale, and the container and volume
      removal never run. It is handed the **post-removal** roster, and that is
      load-bearing rather than incidental: decommissioning the offending persona's
      own last user drops that persona from the referenced set and so must still
      succeed — it is the one remediation that needs no image rebuild. A future
      change that probes the pre-removal roster silently takes that away.
    * :func:`write_web_terminal_artifacts` — belt and braces, and the only cover
      for :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.provision.force_recreate_auth_sidecar`,
      whose pre-recreate re-render reaches the render seam through neither of the
      call sites above. The seam has to answer for itself.

    No call site is redundant; removing any one of them leaves a real path
    uncovered. The decommission check is the easiest to mistake for duplication,
    because the seam behind it means deleting it breaks no test about *safety* —
    only the one about ordering
    (``test_decommission_refuses_before_touching_the_roster_when_a_survivor_is_conflicted``).

    Two directories, deliberately, because the two kinds of file have opposite
    lifetimes. The artifacts are render output and land in ``<repo>/build``;
    ``.env.auth`` is a durable 0600 credential store and stays at the repo root,
