"""Seed per-user CLAUDE.md and skills into web-terminal containers.

Runs both as the ``osprey up`` post-up hook and standalone via ``osprey users
seed``, sharing one implementation driven directly off the parsed facility
config. Reads the on-disk ``build/docker/web-terminal-context/`` overlay tree
the build renders (:func:`_context_dir`) and reconciles each live user
container.

Contract:

* ``CLAUDE.md`` is REPLACED every run: the overlay tree's ``base.md``
  concatenated with the user's ``extra.md`` (or the legacy flat ``<user>.md``),
  piped into the container's ``/data/claude-config/CLAUDE.md`` (user scope —
  not gated by ``--setting-sources``, unlike skills). A user whose resolved
  persona sets ``seed_base: false`` is seeded from its ``extra.md`` alone, with
  no base prepend — the shared base is opt-out per persona (default on).
* ``skills/`` is idempotent and non-destructive via a ``.deploy-managed``
  sentinel dropped inside the container: only sentinel-bearing skill dirs are
  ever touched. A user's live-installed skill (e.g. ``osprey skills install``,
  no sentinel) always survives a reseed. Every overlay-shipped skill dir gets
  re-stamped; a previously-managed skill the overlay no longer ships is
  removed.
* A user whose container isn't up yet is skipped (logged), not fatal — the
  rest of the roster is still seeded.
* The overlay tree's ``base.md`` is required whenever at least one
  to-be-seeded user's persona keeps the base prepend (``seed_base: true``, the
  default); its absence then aborts the whole seed up front (a misconfiguration,
  not a per-user issue) — mirroring the bash source's ``exit 1``. When every
  seeded user opts out (``seed_base: false``), a missing base.md is not an error.

    A user whose container isn't up yet is logged and skipped (not fatal —
    seeding continues for the rest of the roster); the same is true of a
    single ready container whose seed fails, so long as at least one *other*
    ready container in this run succeeds. But when every container this run
    actually attempted (i.e. every container that existed and was execed into)
    fails, that is treated as a systemic misconfiguration — e.g. an image
    whose runtime user cannot be determined for the ownership handoff — rather
    than an isolated per-user issue, and raised so ``osprey up``/``osprey users seed``
    surfaces it instead of silently reporting success with nothing seeded.

    A missing ``base.md`` is a misconfiguration too, and not a per-user
    problem, so it aborts before any user is touched — but only when at least
    one to-be-seeded user's persona keeps the base prepend (``seed_base: true``,
    the default). When every seeded user opts out (``seed_base: false``), each
    is seeded from its ``extra.md`` alone and a missing base.md is tolerated.
    No-op if web terminals are disabled or the roster is empty (and ``user``
    was not given).

    Each user's skills target directory is derived from their resolved
    persona's ``container_project_dir`` (via :func:`personas.resolve_personas`,
    ``strict=True``) rather than a hardcoded ``<facility_prefix>-assistant``
    path, so a user on a non-default persona gets skills seeded into their
    own project's render zone (``<project>/build/.claude/skills``, the
    ``.claude/`` the CLI actually reads at project scope). ``CLAUDE.md`` seeding is unaffected by
    persona — the ``base.md``/``extra.md`` overlay convention and its target
    path are the same for every user regardless of persona.

    Args:
        config: Parsed facility config (a ``ConfigBuilder``
            raw-config dict).
        user: If given, seed only this user's container; a user not present in
            ``modules.web_terminals.users`` raises rather than silently
            no-op'ing. If ``None`` (default), seed every user on the roster.
        env: Environment for runtime subprocess calls. Defaults to
            ``runtime_env(config)`` (``os.environ`` pinned with
            ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME``).
        config_path: Path the ``config`` was loaded from, when the caller has
