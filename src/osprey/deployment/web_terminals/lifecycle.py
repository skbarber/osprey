"""Per-user web-terminal lifecycle verbs: decommission, prune, nuke, passwd.

This module owns the destructive side of multi-user web-terminal deployments —
removing a user's container/volumes and the roster entry, artifacts, and routing
that referenced them. It is deliberately built from a small set of exact-named,
composable primitives (:func:`remove_container`, :func:`remove_volume`,
:func:`remove_image`, :func:`archive_volume`, :func:`confirm_destroy`) so that
every runtime-mutating call in this file is auditable at a glance: no
``prune``, no ``-a``/``--all``, no label glob, no bare ``down -v`` — every
removal argv names exactly one resource, or (for :func:`nuke_stack`'s container
teardown) is an explicit ``compose -p <project> down`` naming exactly one
project. The one place this module *reads* runtime state in bulk is
:func:`prune_users`'s orphan discovery (``ps -a`` / ``volume ls``), which is
read-only and never itself a removal argv; :func:`nuke_stack`'s pre-removal
``image inspect`` calls are the same kind of read-only check.

:func:`decommission_user`, :func:`prune_users`, and :func:`nuke_stack` are the
three destructive verbs this module implements. :func:`rotate_user_password` is
the one non-destructive verb here: it changes a credential rather than removing
a resource, but it belongs with the others because it is reached the same way
(``osprey users <verb> <user>``) and needs the same roster/runtime gating.

Volume-scoping boundary (applies to :func:`prune_users`'s discovery and to
:func:`nuke_stack`'s per-user volume teardown alike): orphan discovery
(:func:`_discover_orphan_containers`, :func:`_discover_orphan_volumes`) filters
the runtime listing by the compose-assigned owning-project label
(``com.docker.compose.project=<project>``, matching exactly what
:func:`osprey.deployment.runtime_helper.runtime_env`'s ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME``
pins compose to stamp on every container/volume it creates) *before* any
name-based parsing — so two OSPREY deployments on the same host, even ones
whose project names happen to share a prefix or contain an underscore, can
never cross-match each other's containers or volumes. The printed plan + typed
confirmation every destructive verb here requires remains the operator's
backstop regardless: nothing is removed without the operator seeing the exact
resource names first.

REPO-ROOT CONTRACT. Everything a verb here touches follows ONE repo, the one
:func:`~osprey.deployment.compose_generator.resolve_repo_root` derives from the
``config_path`` the verb was handed, rather than the working directory:

* the ``.env``/``.env.auth`` credential files and the ``--archive`` tarball
  directory, which these verbs resolve themselves;
* the artifact re-render, the nginx reload, and the auth-sidecar recreate,
  which take the resolved repo as an explicit argument.

``config_path`` is the most authoritative input that resolver takes —
filesystem truth, unlike a ``project_root`` key that a ``--runtime-root`` build
rewrites to a container path — so a programmatic caller passing only
``config_path`` gets paths that agree with the config it passed, from any
working directory.

The recreate is in that list because it is the step that puts a credential
change into FORCE, and it was the last thing here resolving a root of its own:
against a repo it derived from the working directory it found no rendered
compose file, warned "not deployed", reconciled nothing, and returned — after
the roster edit and the credential purge had already succeeded. Threading the
repo (:func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.provision.force_recreate_auth_sidecar`'s
``repo_root``) is what makes the file on disk and the running sidecar agree
from any directory.

Image-scoping boundary (applies only to :func:`nuke_stack`'s persona-image
teardown): unlike containers and volumes, image tags are host-global — two
OSPREY deployments that happen to use identically-named personas would build
identically-named ``<persona.project>-<persona>:local`` tags. There is no
label-filtered *listing* equivalent to ``ps -a``/``volume ls`` for this (image
tags aren't compose-project-scoped), so each candidate tag is instead
individually verified with ``image inspect`` against its own
``com.osprey.project`` label (stamped by the local-mode image build,
:func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.persona_images.build_persona_images`) before it
is ever considered for removal — a missing or mismatched label means the tag
is skipped with a warning, not removed, since it may belong to a sibling
deployment.

    Order of operations, each a prerequisite for the next:

    1. Resolve the user against the roster; unknown user -> ``ValueError``, nothing

    2. If ``archive``/``purge`` was requested, gate on a typed confirmation
       *before touching anything* — a decline (or a blank/non-matching response
       without ``assume_yes``) must be a true no-op: roster, ``config.yml``,

       matters because roster/artifact/container changes are only cheaply

       declining must not leave the roster edited but the confirmation refused.
    3. Freeze the roster's current positional indices onto explicit ``index``

       re-resolves every survivor onto ``default_persona`` — a silent privilege
       change on the next render, in the direction of the default.
    4. Re-render the web-terminal artifacts from the updated config, so the
       deployed nginx route/compose service/landing card for the user disappear.
    5. Force-remove the user's exact-named container.
    6. Per ``archive``/``purge``, handle the user's two named volumes: retain

def nuke_stack(config_path: str | Path, *, assume_yes: bool = False) -> None:
    """Tear down this project's entire web-terminal + service stack.

    The most destructive verb in this module: unlike :func:`decommission_user`
    (one named user) and :func:`prune_users` (only off-roster orphans), ``nuke``
    removes *everything* this project owns — every web-terminal, nginx, and base
    service container, every named volume belonging to this project's web
    terminals (roster *and* off-roster/orphaned alike), and every roster
    persona's locally-built image — with no retain option.

    Containers are torn down with a single project-scoped ``compose -p <project>
    down`` rather than by enumerating container names one at a time: the base
    services (postgres, dispatch worker, event dispatcher, etc.) have no
    config-derived name list the way web-terminal users do, but every container
    this project ever started shares the same compose project (pinned by
    :func:`osprey.deployment.runtime_helper.runtime_env`'s
    ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME``), so an explicit ``-p <project>`` reaches exactly
    (and only) this project's containers without a wildcard, ``-a``/``--all``,
    or a container-name list that could drift out of sync with what is actually
    deployed. This is also why the volume set must include off-roster users:
    ``compose down`` removes an orphaned user's container right along with
    everyone else's (it doesn't consult the roster), so a volume set built from
    the roster alone would leave that user's two volumes behind — contradicting
    "tear down everything this project owns." The ``down`` never carries
    ``--volumes``/``-v``: volumes are removed
    afterwards, one exact name at a time, so the destroy argv for data is
    always provably exact-named (see the module docstring for the volume-
    scoping boundary this relies on).

    Image removal is deliberately the least trusting step: image tags
    (``<persona.project>-<persona>:local``) are host-global, not scoped to this
    project the way ``com.docker.compose.project``-labeled containers/volumes
    are, so a same-named tag could belong to an entirely different deployment.
    Every candidate tag is therefore ``image inspect``-verified against its own
    ``com.osprey.project`` label before removal (see the module docstring's
    image-scoping boundary); a missing tag is tolerated silently (nothing to
    remove), and a missing/mismatched label is skipped with a warning rather
    than removed.

    Order of operations:

    1. Load the config; resolve the project name and the roster's user names.
    2. Compute the volume teardown set: each roster user's two exact volume
       names (:func:`osprey.deployment.compose_generator.resolve_user_volume_names`),
       unioned with any off-roster/orphaned project volumes the runtime
       actually has (:func:`_discover_orphan_volumes`, the same read-only
       discovery :func:`prune_users` uses) — so a user who was decommissioned
       with the default retain policy, or hand-edited out of ``config.yml``,
       still gets their volumes torn down by ``nuke``.
    3. Compute the image teardown set: resolve the roster's personas leniently
       (:func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.resolve_personas` with
       ``strict=False`` — a stale/bad persona reference never blocks ``nuke``),
       collect the distinct ``:local``-suffixed image tags (registry-mode
       images and lenient-degraded entries never resolve to a ``:local`` tag,
       so they are never candidates), then ``image inspect`` each candidate and
       keep only the ones whose ``com.osprey.project`` label matches this
       deployment's project name.
    4. Print a plan (the project-scoped container teardown, the full exact
       volume list — roster and orphan, and the label-verified image list, plus
       a warning line for any candidate image skipped on label mismatch), then
       gate on a typed confirmation (unless ``assume_yes``) *before touching
       anything* — same ordering lesson as :func:`decommission_user`: a decline
       must be a true no-op, so nothing runs until confirmation succeeds.
    5. Run the project-scoped ``compose down`` (containers only). A non-zero
       exit aborts immediately, before any volume or image is touched —
       proceeding would just fail again downstream (volume "in use") while
       masking the real error, and the CLI would report success on a failed
       teardown.
    6. Remove each exact-named volume from the teardown set.
    7. Remove each label-verified exact-named image tag from the teardown set.

    Args:
        config_path: Path to the facility ``config.yml``.
        assume_yes: Skip the typed confirmation gate — the non-interactive/
            scripted path.

) -> None:
    """Put a roster removal into force on the running auth sidecar.

    Removing a user's container and roster entry is not enough when
    authentication is on. Three things outlive it, and each is closed here:

    1. **The departed user's credentials** stay in ``.env.auth``, so a re-added
       same-name user would silently inherit the previous holder's password.
       :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.auth_credentials.purge_auth_credentials`
       removes them.
    2. **The rendered nginx routes** for that user are already gone from
       ``nginx.conf`` on disk, but nginx is still serving the previous config —
       hence the reload, which only applies when the caller actually re-rendered.
    3. **The sidecar's own view**: its roster arrives as a compose ``environment``
       entry and its hashes through ``env_file``, BOTH of which compose baked
       into the container at creation time. Only a recreate re-reads them, which
       is also what kills the removed user's live session immediately rather
       than at its natural expiry.

    A no-op when ``auth.method`` is ``none``: there is no sidecar, no
    ``.env.auth``, and nothing about an unauthenticated deployment changes.

    Args:
        config: The deploy config (post-edit for a re-rendered caller).
        removed: Usernames whose credentials should be purged.
        rerendered: Whether the caller re-rendered the web-terminal artifacts.
            ``True`` (decommission) always reloads nginx — the re-rendered
            routes are on disk whatever else happens — and recreates the
            sidecar unless the purge failed having removed nothing: an
            unchanged ``.env.auth`` leaves the recreate nothing to put into
            force (see Raises). The roster in the sidecar's compose definition
            changed, so the recreate is required even if the user had no
            credentials to purge.
            ``False`` (prune, which removes only already-off-roster resources
            and re-renders nothing of its own — the recreate primitive
            re-renders just before recreating, so the fresh sidecar's digest
            label matches the purged file) recreates only when a purge actually
            changed ``.env.auth``, so a prune that found nothing to purge
            leaves every live terminal and session untouched.
        repo_root: The deployment repo ``.env.auth`` lives in, resolved by the
            caller from its ``config_path`` (see the module's REPO-ROOT
            CONTRACT). Passed in rather than re-derived here, and passed on to
            the sidecar recreate, so the purge, the nginx reload and the
            recreate all address the same repo.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If a credential purge or the sidecar recreate failed. A
            purge that failed *after* clearing someone else's credentials still
            recreates the sidecar first, so the part that did succeed is in
            force before the error is raised; the message then names only the
            users whose credentials survive.

    The verb behind ``osprey users passwd <user>``. Order of operations, each a
    prerequisite for the next:

    1. Gate on this deployment having an OSPREY-managed password to change at
       all. ``auth.method: none`` has no credentials, and under ``oidc`` the
       facility's identity provider holds them — writing a hash in either case
       would produce a credential nothing ever checks, while telling the
       operator their password had changed.
    2. Gate on the roster. An off-roster name keys a variable no rendered
       sidecar reads, so its "new password" could never be used.
    3. Gate on the container runtime, *before* anything is written, so a
       rotation cannot leave an operator holding a password that the deployment
       was never told about.
    4. Replace the stored hash (:func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.auth_credentials.set_auth_password`).
    5. Force-recreate the sidecar through the shared
       :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.provision.force_recreate_auth_sidecar`,
       so the new password works the moment this returns rather than at the next
       deploy. That primitive re-renders the artifacts first, so the recreated
       sidecar's digest label matches the ``.env.auth`` holding the new hash;
       it is a warning-and-no-op when nothing has been rendered at this project
       root, so rotating a password before the stack has ever been deployed
       still stores the hash rather than failing.

    Every one of that user's live sessions dies as a side effect — the session
    cookie carries the generation tag of the hash it was issued against — which
    is what makes this usable as a revocation: rotating a password ends the
    access it granted. No other user's session is affected.

) -> subprocess.CompletedProcess:
    """Project-scoped ``compose down`` — containers/networks only, never volumes.

    Built through the invocation seam like every other compose command — the
    pinned base plus the provider env — because a bare ``-p <project> down``
    is an argv only the docker shape can act on: podman-compose has no
    file-less, label-only ``down``, takes its project directory from the first
    ``-f`` file's dirname (or ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_DIR``, 1.4.1+), and exits
    non-zero, which aborted every nuke on a podman-compose host before it
    removed anything.

    ``-p <project>`` still pins the project name — compose resolves it against
    the ``com.docker.compose.project`` label every container this project ever
    started carries — and ``--remove-orphans`` keeps the file-less
    invocation's reach: containers of services no longer in the rendered files
    (a renamed roster, a dropped service) go down with the roster, matching
    the off-roster volume sweep beside this call. The subprocess environment
    is built WITHOUT ``COMPOSE_IGNORE_ORPHANS``: docker compose hard-errors on
    that variable combined with ``--remove-orphans`` rather than letting one
    win. Never passed ``--volumes``/``-v`` — volume destruction is the
    caller's responsibility, one exact name at a time (see :func:`nuke_stack`).

    A repo with no rendered compose files at all falls back to the bare
    file-less argv: there is nothing for the seam to address, and the docker
    shape is the one provider that can still act on labels alone.

    Does not raise on a non-zero exit and does not itself decide what a failure
    means — :func:`nuke_stack` is the caller that must inspect
    ``result.returncode`` and abort *before* touching any volume, since a volume
    removed out from under a container ``down`` failed to stop would just fail
    again downstream while masking the real error.

    Args:
        config: Raw deploy config, for the runtime, the provider probe and the
            env chain.
