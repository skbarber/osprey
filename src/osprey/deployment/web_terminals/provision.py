"""Host-side provisioning of multi-user web-terminal deployments.

Extracts the web-terminal-only provisioning logic ``osprey up`` runs
before and around the compose invocation for a ``modules.web_terminals``
deploy: per-persona local image builds (over the persona projects ``osprey
build`` rendered), ``.env.users`` generation for local-mode deploys, ``.env.auth``
credential provisioning and its fail-closed gate when authentication is on,
rootless-podman ``loginctl`` linger, the advisory post-up ``verify.sh`` smoke
check, and the dual-compose (backend-services + web stack) orchestration itself.

``osprey.deployment.container_lifecycle.deploy_up`` delegates the whole
web-terminal branch to :func:`deploy_up_web_terminals` here; everything generic
or shared with the plain (non-web) deploy path stays in ``container_lifecycle``.

    """Fail-fast web-terminal preflight, run BEFORE any image build.

    ``deploy_up`` invokes this ahead of its (minutes-long) project-image
    build so the deploy aborts that need no image at all — an
    unresolvable persona catalog, a persona that would hold
    ``BLUESKY_LAUNCH_TOKEN`` while its agent may also run a shell
    (:func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.artifacts.check_bash_launch_token_conflict`),
    a missing provider auth secret
    (:func:`ensure_env_production`'s fail-closed gate), a registry-mode
    deployment with no ``auth.image`` (:func:`_require_auth_sidecar_image`) and
    an auth credential that could not be established
    (:func:`_provision_auth_secrets`) — surface in seconds. Local mode first
    checks that every referenced persona has a rendered project (the credential
    sweep reads each rendered persona's ``config.yml``), exactly as the main
    provisioning path does, which is why the repo root is passed to both: the
    renders it looks for are the ones ``osprey build`` wrote into that repo's
    ``build/``.

    Auth provisioning runs LAST, and in both image-source modes: the sidecar's
    credentials are needed whatever the images come from, but minting them for
    a deploy that :func:`ensure_env_production` is about to abort would write
    (and print) passwords for a stack that never comes up.

    Every step is idempotent, so :func:`deploy_up_web_terminals` re-running
    the same sequence later is a cheap no-op: the persona check reads and
    writes nothing, and an existing ``.env.users`` is returned as-is. Auth
    provisioning is idempotent in the same sense — an established hash or secret
    is never rewritten. Assumes the project-root cwd every
    other step of ``osprey up`` already relies on.

    Nothing is returned: whatever this preflight (or an operator's hand-edit)
    did to ``.env.auth`` is picked up by the deploy's own re-render, which
    stamps the file's content digest into the sidecar's service definition
    (see :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.artifacts.write_web_terminal_artifacts`)

    A no-op when ``modules.web_terminals.auth.method`` is ``none`` (the

    deployment behaves byte-for-byte as it did before authentication existed.

    Otherwise, in this order:

    1. **Mint** — :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.auth_credentials.ensure_auth_credentials`
       for the roster (``password`` mode only: it is the sole method that
       consults a stored hash, and an ``oidc`` deployment must not accumulate
       passwords nobody will ever type), then
       :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.auth_credentials.ensure_auth_session_secrets`,
       which runs in EVERY method. The latter is not optional in ``oidc`` mode
       for two independent reasons: the sidecar 503s without a cookie-signing
       secret, and the sidecar's compose service declares ``env_file:
       .env.auth`` — ``compose up`` hard-fails when that file does not exist,
       so this call is also what brings the file into being on a fresh root.
       A password the mint has to invent is shown once — but only to a terminal;
       see :func:`_mint_echo` for where it goes otherwise and why.
    2. **Gate** — :func:`_raise_if_auth_provisioning_incomplete`, as a
       post-mint invariant. Deliberately after the mint, never instead of it:
       the question is not "was a credential configured?" but "does one exist
       now?", and only the mint can answer that.

    Nothing wraps the mint in ``try``/``except``: ``ensure_auth_credentials``
    raises (writing nothing) on a roster it cannot key — a charset violation,
    or two usernames colliding onto one credential variable — and that raise IS
    the deploy abort. ``osprey up`` never runs lint, so swallowing it would
    silently deploy a stack where one operator's password opens another's
    terminal.

    The method is read through
    :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.render._auth_tls_context` rather
    than off the raw stanza, so the deploy path and the rendered artifacts can
    never disagree about what ``auth`` means — and an unsupported method raises
    here as well, ahead of the render that would otherwise be the first to
    notice.

    Whether the mint added content is deliberately NOT reported: the deploy's
    re-render digests ``.env.auth`` into the sidecar's service definition, so
    compose itself detects any content change — authored here or hand-edited —

    Compose bakes ``env_file`` CONTENT into a container at creation time, and
    podman-compose never recreates a container whose service definition is
    unchanged — so after ``.env.auth`` changes, neither a plain ``up -d`` nor a
    restart puts the new credentials in force. Only a recreate does. (The
    deploy path needs no call here: it re-renders the compose file, whose
    digest label turns the content change into a service-definition change
    that compose itself acts on — see
    :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.artifacts.write_web_terminal_artifacts`.)

    One function because its callers — the paths that change ``.env.auth``
    WITHOUT issuing a plain ``up`` the label could act through — must all do
    it identically:

    1. the lifecycle verbs (``decommission_user``/``prune_users``), which purge
       a departed user's entries and must kill that user's sessions at once;
    2. ``osprey users passwd <user>``, so a rotated password takes effect
       immediately rather than at the next full deploy.

    Re-renders the artifacts (via :func:`write_web_terminal_artifacts`) before
    the recreate, so the container it creates carries the digest label of the
    exact ``.env.auth`` it bakes. Without this, every caller above recreates
    from a compose file rendered BEFORE its file mutation, leaving label !=
    sha256(baked env): the next ``osprey up`` re-renders the current digest,
    sees a definition change, and spuriously bounces an already-current sidecar
    — and, worse, a byte-exact revert of ``.env.auth`` to the pre-mutation
    content would render a digest MATCHING the stale label, so podman-compose
    would skip the recreate and silently keep serving the reverted-away
    credentials. The render is best-effort: if it fails, the recreate still
    runs against the existing compose file (a recreate always re-bakes the
    CURRENT file content — only the label lags, at the cost of one spurious
    bounce at the next deploy), because skipping the recreate over a render
    error would leave a purged user's password in force.

    Scoped to the single ``auth`` service: recreating the whole stack would
    bounce every live terminal for a change none of them can see.

    A no-op (with a warning) when the repo has no rendered
    ``build/docker-compose.web.yml`` — there is no stack to recreate, and
    failing here would turn "nothing was deployed yet" into a deploy error.
    One repo answers that probe, the pre-recreate re-render, and the compose
    argv: all three are taken from the ``repo_root`` resolved once at the top
    of this function, so the probe can only ever address the file the recreate
    runs against. Split, they diverge quietly — a probe made against the
    working directory answered "no" for a repo whose stack was rendered and
    running, so ``osprey users passwd`` warned, recreated nothing, and reported
    a rotation that was never put in force.

    :param config: Raw deploy config (selects the runtime and the pinned

        the lifecycle verbs (``passwd``, ``decommission``, ``prune``) pass since
        they are entered straight from the CLI.
    :param repo_root: The deployment repo this recreate acts on — the one whose
        ``build/`` is probed and re-rendered and whose root compose pins as the

      from ``.env`` when absent. Then :func:`build_persona_images` builds
      every referenced persona's ``<project>-<persona>:local`` image —
      called with :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.resolve_personas`'s

      configured at all) raises HERE, before any compose invocation, rather
      than surfacing as an opaque "no such image" failure at ``compose up``.
      Local mode's web-stack invocation then runs bare ``up -d`` — NO
      ``pull`` anywhere on this path. This is load-bearing, not an
      optimization: ``compose pull`` hard-fails (exit 1) on a local-only
      tag it can't find in any registry, the same trap the backend-services
      sub-invocation below already avoids for a service with no published
      upstream tag.

    WHY TWO INVOCATIONS, NOT ONE ``-f a -f b -f build/docker-compose.web.yml``:
    not path resolution. Compose resolves every *relative* path in
    every merged ``-f`` file (bind-mount sources, ``build:`` contexts,
    ``env_file:``) against ONE directory, and both invocations below pin
    that directory to the same repo root
    (:func:`~osprey.deployment.compose_generator.compose_base_cmd`), with every
    template spelled against it. Two files, one base — which is what makes the
    web file's ``env_file: .env.auth`` (repo root) and its ``./build/nginx/…``
    mounts (render zone) both resolve correctly from a single pin.

    What keeps them apart is the command SEQUENCE, not the paths: the web stack
    runs ``pull`` before ``up`` in registry mode, which the services stack must
    never do (a service with only a ``build:`` block has no upstream tag, and
    ``compose pull`` hard-fails on it), while ``dev_mode`` gives the services
    stack a ``build`` step the web stack has no use for. Merging the two behind
    one ``-f`` list would mean re-expressing that split as per-service argument
    lists; it is possible under the pinned base, and deliberately not done here.
    Splitting costs nothing functionally: the web stack runs every service under
    ``network_mode: host`` (see ``docker-compose.web.yml.j2``), so it never
    needed to join ``osprey-network`` from the services file anyway.

    The services sub-invocation only runs when a real service is deployed
    (``config["deployed_services"]`` non-empty): ``compose_files`` always
    includes the top-level ``build/services/docker-compose.yml`` (a bare
    network declaration, no ``services:`` key) even for a web-terminals-only
    deploy, and ``compose up`` on a file with zero services fails outright
    with ``no service selected`` — this is exactly why the *plain* non-web
    path's own early-return guards on ``deployed_services`` before ever
    reaching ``up``. It also never runs ``pull``: unlike the web stack's
    images (always registry-hosted — ``nginx:*-alpine`` and
    ``<registry>/web-terminal:latest``), a deployed service like
    ``event_dispatcher`` may declare only a ``build:`` block with no
    published upstream tag, and ``compose pull`` hard-fails (exit 1) on a
    buildable service compose can't find remotely — ``compose up`` builds it
    locally instead, exactly like the plain non-web path already relies on.

    This path always runs detached, regardless of the caller's ``--detached``
    flag: ``deploy_up``'s non-detached path ``os.execvpe``-replaces the current
    process (see below), which would make it impossible for a caller to run
    anything — e.g. the post-up hook this function ends with — after
    ``compose up`` returns. A web-terminal deploy needs that hook, so it can
    never take the execvpe path.

    Idempotency comes from compose's own reconciliation (``pull`` (registry
    mode only) + ``up -d`` for the web stack; plain ``up -d`` for the
    services stack, mirroring the non-web path): no bespoke digest/state
    diffing, and deliberately no ``--force-recreate`` on either invocation,
    so a no-op second run recreates zero containers. Each invocation is
    preceded by a ``rm -f`` stale-container preflight (see the inline
    comments for why it is service-scoped and why ``--remove-orphans`` is
    forbidden on this path); running containers are untouched, so the
    zero-recreate property holds. Under ``dev_mode`` the
    services ``up -d`` also carries ``--build``, mirroring the non-web
    path's dev-mode ``--build``: without it, a co-deployed backend service's
    cached image tag would keep running the stale code from its first
    build. The web stack never needs ``--build`` — none of its images have
    a ``build:`` block (registry mode) or is otherwise built with this
    module's own dev-wheel machinery (local mode — see
    :func:`build_persona_images`).

    :param config: Raw deploy config.
    :param compose_files: Compose files ``prepare_compose_files`` already
        resolved — always at least the top-level network-only file, even for
        a web-terminals-only deploy (see the ``deployed_services`` guard
        above for why that alone doesn't get an ``up`` invocation).
    :param dev_mode: Whether ``--dev`` was passed; appends ``--build`` to the
        services stack's ``up -d`` invocation when set, and is threaded into
        :func:`build_persona_images` (local mode) for its own dev-wheel
        staging.
    :param env: Base environment for the pull/up subprocesses (already has
        ``DEV_MODE`` applied by the caller when relevant); pinned with
        ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`` via :func:`runtime_env` before use here so
        both invocations share one project namespace — and so the volume
        namespace compose derives matches the project name baked into
        container labels.
    :param env_file_args: The ``["--env-file", ".env"]`` (or ``[]``) argv
        fragment ``deploy_up`` resolved via ``_env_file_args``; passed in
        rather than recomputed here so the "no .env" warning stays defined in
        one place and this module needs no import back into
        ``container_lifecycle``.
    :param provider: The compose provider ``deploy_up`` probed for, threaded
        down so both invocations below carry the shape the ``env_file_args``
        above were already resolved for. ``None`` probes again (memoized) —
        the fragment and the argv it is spliced into must never disagree about
        the provider, which is what a fragment threaded in without its provider
        would produce.
    :param repo_root: The deployment repo ``deploy_up`` resolved, threaded down
        for the same reason the fragment above is: it is the compose project
        directory both invocations are pinned to, and re-resolving it here can
        answer the working directory instead (see :func:`_resolved_repo_root`).
        ``None`` resolves it from ``config``.

    **Image drift** (podman only). ``podman-compose`` 1.0.6 treats a
    container as up-to-date whenever its service definition is unchanged, so
    a same-tag digest change (a re-pulled ``:latest``, or any moving tag)
    never triggers a recreate — ``up -d`` leaves the container running the
    previous image. This inspects, for each service the rendered
    ``docker-compose.web.yml`` declares, the image ID its ``image:``
    reference now resolves to versus the image ID its running container was
    created from. Gated to podman: ``docker compose`` already recreates a
    service after its image is re-pulled, so a second forced recreate would
    needlessly bounce a live terminal. Every inspection is advisory — a
    service whose image or container can't be inspected (missing image,
    container not yet created) is skipped, never aborting the deploy.

    A stale ``.env.auth`` is NOT this function's problem: the render

    trigger every compose implementation honours — verified on Docker Compose

    ``osprey down`` — and because their ``container_name``s are fixed
    host-global identifiers (``<prefix>-web-<user>``, ``<prefix>-nginx``),
    the NEXT web-terminals deploy on the host, from any project, dies at
    ``up`` with a container-name Conflict instead of reconciling.

    A no-op when the repo has no rendered ``build/docker-compose.web.yml``
    (nothing was ever deployed from here, or ``build/`` was wiped).
    Volumes are deliberately kept, mirroring the services
    ``down`` (no ``--volumes``): per-user claude-config/agent-data volumes
    are the durable user state ``osprey users remove`` manages.

    Best-effort: a failing web ``down`` is logged loudly but never raises —
    the caller's services ``down`` (which execvpe-replaces the process) must
    still run, or a broken web stack would leave the backend services
    running too.

    :param config: Raw deploy config (resolves the pinned compose project).
    :param env: Base environment to layer the ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`` pin
        onto, exactly like the ``up`` path's invocations.
    :param env_file_args: ``["--env-file", ".env"]`` (or ``[]``) argv
        fragment, resolved by the caller.
    :param provider: The compose provider the caller probed for; ``None``
        probes again (memoized), so the shape matches the fragment above.
    :param repo_root: The deployment repo being torn down — the one the caller
        resolved the fragment above against. ``None`` resolves it from
        ``config`` (see :func:`_resolved_repo_root`).
