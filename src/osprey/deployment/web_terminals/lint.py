"""Static validation for the ``modules.web_terminals`` multi-user stanza.

The multi-user web stack is derived entirely from ``users[]`` and the persona
catalog beside it, so "consistent" here means: every user resolves to exactly one
container with its own port family, every persona reference resolves to a catalog
entry, and nothing in the stack contends with another service for a host port.

Two surfaces call in, at different altitudes:

* :func:`lint_web_terminals` reads a **rendered project ``config.yml``** — the
  deploy-time view, where the ``services:`` block names every published host port
  and every persona project either exists on disk or is one ``osprey build``
  away. ``osprey scaffold web-terminals lint|render`` runs this one.
* :func:`lint_profile_config` reads a **build profile's ``config:`` block** — the
  authoring-time view, before anything is materialized. It runs the same checks
  minus the ones that can only be answered against a rendered project (see that
  function's docstring), so a profile can be validated without building it.

    A ``config:`` block is a flat bag of dotted keys (``modules.web_terminals``,
    ``facility.prefix``, ``services.openobserve.port``, …) applied over the
    rendered template, so it is nested into the shape the checks read before
    linting. Shallowest key first, so a deeper key refines the subtree a
    shallower one set rather than being overwritten by it — the same order
    ``osprey build`` applies them in.

    Two checks are skipped, because a profile cannot answer them yet:

    * **Persona project paths.** ``project_path`` resolves against the rendered
      project's directory, which does not exist at authoring time.
    * **``build_profile`` shape**, which rides on the same check.
      ``osprey init`` rewrites each catalog entry's preset name into the
      ``personas/<name>.yml`` delta it materializes beside the profile, so the
      value is only in its final form once that has happened.

    Both are enforced in full by :func:`lint_web_terminals` at deploy time.
    Cross-service port overlap is likewise checked only against the host ports
    the ``config:`` block itself declares; a service declared at profile top
    level joins the collision set once the project is rendered.

    ``profile_root`` is the directory the profile being linted lives in, and it
    is not optional in practice: a catalog entry's
    ``build_profile: personas/<name>.yml`` is relative to the profile, so
    without it this falls back to the working directory and a validate run from
    a subdirectory, or through ``--repo`` from outside the repo entirely, reads
    no persona delta at all and reports every persona as unprivileged. Pass it.

    Call this from a COMMAND, never from ``BuildProfile.validate()``. That
    method also runs during profile *resolution*, which ``osprey init``
    goes through, and these findings would then pre-empt that command's own
    persona validator — which reports every unusable catalog entry at once and
    names the file-name rule a persona name really has to meet. The engine

    ``None`` used to mean "cannot tell" and was treated as "holds nothing",
    which is the fail-OPEN direction on the one question this belt exists to
    answer. A catalog entry whose ``build_profile`` points at ``../admin.yml``
    is neither a delta lint may read nor a preset name that resolves, so it read
    as unprivileged — and a ``login: false`` entry pointed at it validated
    clean, built clean, and rendered an unauthenticated terminal holding the
    deployment-editing setup tool.

    Reported only where the answer would decide something, which is exactly the
    two rules this belt owns: the ``default_persona`` every unlabelled entry
    inherits, and an entry that opted out of the login wall. A privileged
    persona behind a login is not an exposure, so an unreadable one behind a
    login is not one either, and refusing it would fail builds over catalog
    entries whose real problem — an absent delta, a preset that does not
    resolve — is already reported, in better words, by the check that owns it.

    Three further narrowings, all deliberate:

    * The ``default_persona`` half is reported only where the deployment
      declares a privilege split (:func:`_deployment_declares_a_privilege_split`)
      — the same migration argument that makes the KNOWN version of that rule
      baseline-relative: an inherited default on a floorless deployment has no
      unprivileged tier to be re-pointed at. The ``login: false`` half is NOT so
      narrowed, for the same reason its known version is absolute: on a
      floorless deployment a persona nobody can read is one nobody can show
      holds less than everything, and that entry is served to anyone.
    * At rendered altitude the ``default_persona`` half is further gated on
      ``image_source: local``. A registry-mode host has no local persona render
      by design, so an unreadable default is that mode's normal state rather
      than drift, and no remedy the operator can execute exists there — the
      profile altitude, where the deltas live, owns that question. Again the
      ``login: false`` half is not gated: its subject is an entry that typed
      itself public, and its remedy is that entry's own key.
    * With ``auth.method: none`` an entry's own ``login`` key is inert, so no
      entry singled itself out; the deployment-wide exposure is advisory there
      (see
      :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.deployment_wide_privileged_exposure_problems`)
      and an ERROR on a persona that *might* be privileged would be a harder
      refusal than the one for a persona known to be. So the unreadable persona
      is reported as a WARN instead — not dropped. Under that posture a READABLE
      privileged persona still draws its own warning, and "cannot tell" must
      never be quieter than "known privileged"; skipping the advisory rung
      entirely was how one cell of the matrix (registry mode, no
      authentication) came to report nothing at all.

    **The remedy always includes a way out the operator holds.** The
    altitude-specific halves ("write the delta", "re-run ``osprey build``") both
    presuppose a document that can be made to resolve, which a deployment
    building its images in CI (``image_source: registry``, the default) cannot
    produce on the host it starts on. Wherever an entry's own ``login: false``
    is what put the persona at stake, ``login: true`` for that user is offered
    too — the same remedy the KNOWN version of this rule
    (:func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.unauthenticated_privileged_terminal_problems`)
    leads with, so the two halves of one rule do not disagree about their own
    remedy set.

    The belt behind the one build-time guard —
    :func:`osprey.cli.profile_cmd._privileged_persona_problems`, which
    :func:`~osprey.cli.profile_cmd._persona_profile_texts` raises at ``osprey
    init`` — catching the same two mistakes on the paths that guard does not sit
    on: a profile edited after ``osprey init`` (``osprey profile validate``,
    ``osprey build``) and a project already rendered (``osprey up``). Both rules
    and both messages come from
    :mod:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas`, so the belt and the brace
    cannot disagree about what counts as privileged or about what to do next.

    **The two rules read two different answers**, which is the one thing to know
    before reading the code below. The ``login: false`` rule is judged on what a
    persona ABSOLUTELY holds; the ``default_persona`` rule (and the advisory
    ``auth.method: none`` arm) on what it holds beyond its deployment's
    baseline. Exempting a floorless deployment from the first was a hole big
    enough to drive the whole belt through: delete the base tier's deny floor
    from a profile and every persona is at baseline, so a ``login: false`` admin
    terminal validated clean, built clean and linted clean while rendering a
    settings.json with nothing denied. See
    :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.privileges_beyond_baseline`
    for why the other rules keep the relative reading.

    **An unauthenticated privileged terminal is an ERROR at BOTH altitudes.**
    The exposure is the same one either way — a card on the landing page that
    opens into a terminal that can edit the deployment — and the rendered
    altitude is the only place a hand-edited ``config.yml`` is ever read, so a
    warning there is a finding the surfaces that gate on errors discard. A
    render that predates the base tier's deny floor is refused too, and the
    message says so and says to rebuild: this release changes the image's
    entrypoint and privilege split anyway, so every deployment is re-rendering
    regardless, and "rebuild" is a remedy an operator can carry out rather than
    a rule with no way back.

    A privileged ``default_persona`` stays advisory against a RENDERED project.
    It is an authoring mistake, not an open door — the entries that inherit it
    are still behind whatever wall the deployment has, and the ones that are not
    are reported by the rule above, by name. Refusing the start of a running
    stack over the shape of its roster would stop a shift to fix a profile.
    ``osprey up`` prints warnings as advisories, so it is said out loud either
    way, and rebuilding turns it into the error it is at profile altitude.

    * **Existence.** The directory must exist and hold a ``Dockerfile`` and a
      ``config.yml`` whose own ``project_name`` equals the catalog ``project``
      (a mismatch silently produces a dead mount, since the per-svc
      ``container_project_dir`` derivation is keyed on the catalog's ``project``,

    That is the ordinary state of a persona added since the last build, and the
    ordinary command clears it: ``osprey build`` renders one project per delta.
    It is not an error because nothing is misconfigured; it is not merely
    informational because ``osprey up`` refuses to start until the render is
    there. A *partially* rendered directory that exists but is missing its

    Args:
        root: The whole parsed config — the gate reads the ``auth`` posture off
