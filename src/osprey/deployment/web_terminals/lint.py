"""Static validation for the ``modules.web_terminals`` multi-user stanza.

The multi-user web stack is derived entirely from ``users[]`` and the persona
catalog beside it, so "consistent" here means: every user resolves to exactly one
container with its own port family, every persona reference resolves to a catalog
entry, and nothing in the stack contends with another service for a host port.

Two surfaces call in, at different altitudes:

* :func:`lint_web_terminals` reads a **rendered project ``config.yml``** — the
  deploy-time view, where the ``services:`` block names every published host port
  and every persona project either exists on disk or is one ``osprey build``
  away. ``osprey scaffold web-terminals lint|render`` runs this one.
* :func:`lint_profile_config` reads a **build profile's ``config:`` block** — the
  authoring-time view, before anything is materialized. It runs the same checks
  minus the ones that can only be answered against a rendered project (see that
  function's docstring), so a profile can be validated without building it.

    A ``config:`` block is a flat bag of dotted keys (``modules.web_terminals``,

    rendered template, so it is nested into the shape the checks read before
    linting. Shallowest key first, so a deeper key refines the subtree a
    shallower one set rather than being overwritten by it — the same order
    ``osprey build`` applies them in.

    Two checks are skipped, because a profile cannot answer them yet:

    * **Persona project paths.** ``project_path`` resolves against the rendered
      project's directory, which does not exist at authoring time.
    * **``build_profile`` shape**, which rides on the same check.
      ``osprey init`` rewrites each catalog entry's preset name into the
      ``personas/<name>.yml`` delta it materializes beside the profile, so the
      value is only in its final form once that has happened.

    Both are enforced in full by :func:`lint_web_terminals` at deploy time.
    Cross-service port overlap is likewise checked only against the host ports
    the ``config:`` block itself declares; a service declared at profile top
    level joins the collision set once the project is rendered.

    Call this from a COMMAND, never from ``BuildProfile.validate()``. That
    method also runs during profile *resolution*, which ``osprey init``
    goes through, and these findings would then pre-empt that command's own

    while the in-container **mount target** is derived from the DEPLOY config's
    ``bundle_path`` anchored on that persona's project directory. Where the two
    values disagree, a persona is entitled and gets the deployment's bundle bound
    at the deployment's path — while its OKF panel and ``facility_knowledge`` MCP
    server both read the persona's path, which nothing mounted.

    The result is an empty bundle with no error anywhere: the panel lists no
    concepts, the agent's knowledge tools return nothing, and every layer reports
    success. Nothing at runtime can tell that apart from a facility that simply
    has not written any concepts yet, which is why it is caught here.

    An ERROR rather than a warning: unlike a persona that is merely unrendered,
    nothing an operator does later resolves this. The two keys have to be made to
    agree.

    Read from disk on the same terms as :func:`_check_persona_project_paths` —
    ``project_path`` resolved against the working directory, an unreadable or
    unrendered project contributing nothing, since a persona that has not been
    built yet is already reported by that check.

    ``project_path`` names the directory ``osprey up`` builds a persona's
    image from. Two invariants are enforced here:

    * **Name invariant.** When ``project_path`` is set, its basename must equal
      the catalog entry's ``project``. ``osprey build`` names each persona render
      ``<repo>-<delta stem>`` and writes it into ``build/``, so a basename that
      disagrees with ``project`` would leave the render in one directory while
      the catalog builds/mounts
      another — a dead path at runtime. A mismatch is an ERROR regardless of
      whether the directory exists yet.
    * **Existence.** The directory must exist and hold a ``Dockerfile`` and a
      ``config.yml`` whose own ``project_name`` equals the catalog ``project``
      (a mismatch silently produces a dead mount, since the per-svc
      ``container_project_dir`` derivation is keyed on the catalog's ``project``,
      not on anything read from the persona's own ``config.yml``).

    Existence is relaxed to a WARNING — never waived — for a ``project_path``
    that does not exist yet but whose entry carries a usable ``build_profile``.
    That is the ordinary state of a persona added since the last build, and the
    ordinary command clears it: ``osprey build`` renders one project per delta.
    It is not an error because nothing is misconfigured; it is not merely
    informational because ``osprey up`` refuses to start until the render is
    there. A *partially* rendered directory that exists but is missing its
    ``Dockerfile``/``config.yml`` stays an ERROR — a half-written render is a
    broken build rather than an absent one.
