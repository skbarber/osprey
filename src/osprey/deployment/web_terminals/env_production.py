    """Move a leftover ``.env.production`` onto :data:`USERS_ENV_FILENAME`.

    Called once per ``osprey up``, before anything reads the file (see
    ``_start_stack``). The artifact is gitignored and never regenerated when
    present, so a deployment that predates the rename carries the operator's
    only copy of the web tier's runtime secrets under the old name — losing it
    would silently fall through to "registry-mode deploys expect this file"
    (see :func:`ensure_env_production`) on a host that had a working deploy
    minutes earlier.

    Both files can exist at once, and which one is authoritative is not a
    guess: registry-mode CI renders a fresh ``.env.users`` on the host just
    before ``osprey up``, while the old file — gitignored, so untouched by the
    ``git reset --hard`` that precedes a CI checkout — survives from an earlier
    pipeline. The new file is therefore always kept, and the leftover must stop
    looking like a second source of truth. Either way the operator gets one
    line naming both paths.

    Getting there costs a rename, not a delete. The reasoning above is about
    OSPREY's OWN artifact, and it is sound about one — but this function
    identifies that artifact by filename alone, and a file at that name need
    never have been OSPREY's: another tool on the host may keep its own secrets
    under the same spelling, on a deployment that never had a pre-rename
    ``.env.users`` at all. A delete cannot tell the two cases apart, so on the
    second one it destroys the operator's only copy on the strength of a
    filename match, during an ``osprey up`` that asked nothing and warned about
    nothing. Moving the leftover to :data:`SUPERSEDED_USERS_ENV_FILENAME` buys
    the whole of what the delete bought — nothing is left at the old name for a
    later reader to mistake for the live file — and costs an operator one
    ``rm`` instead of a restore from backup.

    The set-aside name is fixed rather than timestamped (see
    :data:`SUPERSEDED_USERS_ENV_FILENAME`), so a copy may already be sitting
    there from an earlier deploy. When one is, the EARLIER copy is kept
    untouched and the rename is skipped: it is the copy closer to the last
    deployment that worked, and overwriting it would lose exactly what this
    branch exists to preserve. The leftover stays where it is, and the one
    reported line names both paths.

    A moved file lands at mode ``0600`` whatever it carried before, matching
    every other write of this artifact — the set-aside copy included, since it
    still holds live secrets and a rename would otherwise carry a
    world-readable mode along with it.

    - ``llm.api_key_env_var`` — the LLM provider key, unconditional.
    - ``claude_code_secret_vars`` — the auth-secret vars resolved by

      of the deploy config and of every referenced persona project), passed

      :func:`ensure_env_production`'s call, not this function's.
    - ``modules.olog.{username,password}_env_var`` — the electronic-logbook
      account, only if ``modules.olog.enabled``.
    - ``modules.wiki_search.token_env_var`` — the wiki credential, only if
      ``modules.wiki_search.enabled``.
    - ``ARIEL_DSN`` — only if ``modules.ariel.enabled``, from
      ``modules.ariel.dsn`` directly. Unlike every entry above this is read
      from ``config``, not ``dotenv``: the DSN is itself a literal config
      value, not the *name* of an env var holding one.
    - ``ZO_ROOT_USER_EMAIL`` — the observability store's account NAME, copied
      when the chain sets it and silently skipped otherwise. A fixed key rather
      than a config-declared one, like the two entries below: the shipped
      telemetry block references it under this spelling and ``osprey up``
      writes it into the deploy env chain under it too. An account name is not
      a secret; it is here because a terminal that emits telemetry has to name
      the same account the store was configured with, and the reference's own
      fallback address is the wrong one on any deploy that set this.
    - ``TZ`` — always, from ``facility.timezone`` (default ``"UTC"``, matching
      the schema's own documented default), likewise a literal config value.

    The store's PASSWORD is deliberately not here beside its account name.
    ``ZO_ROOT_USER_PASSWORD`` is the observability store's single admin
    credential — the same value the store container itself is configured with —
    so a copy in this rosterwide file would grant every persona, read-only ones
    included, admin read of every transcript the store holds. It stays out for
    the same reason the service tokens do (see below), and
    :func:`_telemetry_credential_requirements` exists to REPORT a config that
    depends on it rather than to satisfy one.

    NEVER included, by construction (this function never reads them at all):
    build-time credentials — the CI provider token, the container-registry
    login, every external-project pull token — and the tokens OSPREY's own
    deployed services authenticate to each other with
    (``EVENT_DISPATCHER_TOKEN``, ``DISPATCH_WORKER_TOKEN``,
    ``BLUESKY_LAUNCH_TOKEN`` and the rest of ``_SERVICE_TOKEN_VARS`` in
    :mod:`osprey.deployment.container_lifecycle`, minted per deploy under
    those fixed names). Build-time credentials are nothing a web terminal
    presents to anyone; the containers that need a service token read the deploy
    ``.env`` the main compose file hands them.

    The reason the SERVICE tokens are excluded is narrower, and it is about this
    file rather than about the tokens: ``.env.users`` is a single file
    handed to EVERY per-user container alike. It cannot say "alice but not bob",
    so anything placed here is granted to every persona in the roster —
    including read-only ones, whose entire purpose is not to hold write-capable
    credentials. A per-user entitlement therefore has to be expressed somewhere
    that can distinguish users, and that is the per-user ``environment:`` block
    in ``docker-compose.web.yml``. See
    :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.render.render_web_terminals`, whose
    ``dispatcher_personas``, ``ariel_personas`` and ``launch_token_personas``
    arguments each carry the subset of the roster entitled to one credential —
    ``EVENT_DISPATCHER_TOKEN``, ``ARIEL_DB_PASSWORD`` and
    ``BLUESKY_LAUNCH_TOKEN`` respectively — emitted into that user's own
    ``environment:`` block and interpolated by compose from the deploy ``.env``,
    so the secret never lands in a rendered artifact either.

    So this is NOT the claim that no web terminal ever presents a service token —
    the EVENTS panel's proxy presents the dispatcher token server-side, so the
    browser never holds it, and the ``bluesky`` MCP server presents the launch
    token to the bridge from inside the terminal container. It is the narrower
    and still-load-bearing claim that no
    service token is granted *rosterwide from here*. Note what that buys and
    what it does not: a container that receives one of these tokens shares its
    process namespace with the agent, which can read it, so every grant is a
    deliberate per-persona decision and never a default.

    ``BLUESKY_LAUNCH_TOKEN`` is the sharpest case, because it arms a queue start
    — an agent that holds it can put hardware in motion. Its entitlement
    predicate,
    :func:`osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.config_needs_launch_token`,
    requires BOTH ``control_system.writes_enabled: true`` AND an enabled
    ``bluesky`` MCP server in that persona's own rendered config. A read-only
    persona is spelled ``writes_enabled: false``, so it cannot satisfy that pair
    and can never be handed the token. That guarantee exists only because the
    grant is per-persona; a copy of the token in this file would hand it to
    exactly the personas the predicate is there to exclude.

    One nuance applies to all three credentials alike. A roster entry that names
    no persona — the zero-migration path, where the web image IS the deploy
    project — consults no persona set at all; the render answers it straight
    from the deploy config, via ``config_needs_launch_token``,
    ``config_needs_dispatcher_token`` or ``config_needs_ariel_password``. An
    empty persona set therefore does NOT mean "this credential is granted
    nowhere": persona-less entries are decided independently of it.

    This is the security spec for this function: a var absent from the
    enumerated list above can never appear in the returned dict, regardless of
    what the input env chain contains.

      refusal with its own remedy and not this one.

    Pure: it parses the env chain and each referenced persona's rendered

    ``docker-compose.web.yml`` (see :func:`deploy_up_web_terminals`) declares
    ``env_file: .env.users`` unconditionally, so compose hard-fails before
    a single container starts if that file is missing. This resolves it up
    front, with different rules per ``modules.web_terminals.image_source``
    (default ``"registry"``):

    - **Already present** (either mode): returned as-is, untouched. This is
      always checked first, so an operator-authored or previously-generated
      file is never clobbered. When the config declares LLM credentials
      (``llm.api_key_env_var`` or any ``claude_code.provider`` in play — see
      :func:`_claude_code_auth_secret_vars`) and the existing file contains
      *none* of them, a warning names the missing var(s) — a stale file from
      before a provider change otherwise produces web terminals that fail
      authentication with nothing in the deploy output to say why.
    - **Registry mode, absent**: raises. Registry-mode deploys expect the file
      to have been rendered already by ``osprey users env``,
      which the emitted CI pipeline's deploy job runs
      on the host between ``osprey build`` and ``osprey up``. This
      function only exists-checks in that mode, it never generates, because
      there is no local env chain this system is licensed to treat as the
      authoritative source of a registry-mode deploy's secrets.
    - **Local mode, absent, an env-chain file present**: generated via
      :func:`_build_env_production_subset` (the module-conditional subset,
      including every ``claude_code`` auth secret resolved by
      :func:`_claude_code_auth_secret_vars`) and written with mode ``0600``
      from the moment the file is created — the same permission convention
      :func:`_ensure_service_tokens` uses for minted tokens. A *required*
      ``claude_code`` auth secret absent from the whole chain raises instead
      of generating: the resulting file would produce healthy-looking terminals
      that fail authentication on their first prompt (authoring
      ``.env.users`` directly remains the bypass for deploys that
      authenticate another way). A telemetry password reference that carries no
      default of its own (see :func:`_telemetry_credential_requirements`) joins
      the same gate: the variable it names is reported when the chain does not
      set it, and is never written into the generated file either way.
    - **Local mode, absent, the whole chain absent too**: raises, before any
      compose invocation — there is nothing to generate from and no file to
      fall back on.

    Values come from the merged env chain — :func:`osprey.utils.dotenv.merge_chain`
    reads ``.env.shared`` then ``.env``, so a key both files set takes the
    ``.env`` value and a key only the shared defaults carry is still delivered.
    The chain on disk is the whole source: the ambient process/shell
    environment is never read (unlike :func:`_ensure_service_tokens`'s
