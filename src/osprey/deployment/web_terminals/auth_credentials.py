"""Deploy-time provisioning of per-user web-terminal auth credentials.

Owns ``.env.auth``: the 0600 project-root file holding one
``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_HASH_<USER>`` entry per roster user, referenced ONLY by the
auth sidecar's compose ``env_file`` so an auth secret never reaches a per-user
agent container. :func:`ensure_auth_credentials` establishes a hash for every
roster user; :func:`purge_auth_credentials` removes a departed user's entries so
a re-added same-name user gets a fresh credential rather than inheriting the
previous holder's password.

Provisioning follows the "existing value wins, append what's missing"
convention of the service-token writer
(``osprey.deployment.container_lifecycle._ensure_service_tokens``): re-running a
deploy never rewrites a hash that is already there, so the operation is
idempotent and pre-existing sessions survive a routine deploy.

Two namespaces live under the ``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_`` stem and are deliberately
kept in different files: plaintext ``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_<USER>`` is read from the
project ``.env`` as a convenience input and is hashed on the way in, while
``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_HASH_<USER>`` is written to (and read from) ``.env.auth``.
Only the latter is ever handed to a container, so a plaintext password set for
convenience never ships.

Username validity is enforced *here* as a hard raise rather than left to lint:
``osprey up`` never runs lint, and two usernames that normalize onto one
env-var suffix (``alice-b`` and ``alice_b``) would silently share a single hash
— one operator's password opening the other's terminal, the exact isolation
failure this feature exists to prevent.

    Per user, in precedence order:

    1. An ``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_HASH_<USER>`` entry already in ``.env.auth`` is kept
       untouched — re-deploying is idempotent and does not invalidate sessions.
       An entry present but *empty* (``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_HASH_ALICE=``) does not
       count as established: that user falls through to the steps below and the
       freshly written entry, appended after the empty one, is the one the
       parser returns (last assignment wins). An empty value would otherwise
       leave a roster user permanently unable to log in.
    2. Otherwise a plaintext ``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_<USER>`` in the project ``.env``
       is hashed in. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed before hashing,
       so a value padded by an editor or a copy-paste hashes to what the
       operator will actually type at the login prompt; a password whose real
       content is only whitespace is treated as absent. The plaintext stays in
       ``.env`` (which no container receives on the auth path) and is never
       echoed: the operator already knows it.
    3. Otherwise a random password is minted, hashed, and printed **once**.
       That print is the only moment the password exists in cleartext output;
       it is never logged, and only its hash is persisted, so it cannot be
       recovered afterwards.

    Neither the process environment nor ``.env`` is consulted for a *hash*: the
    sidecar reads its credentials solely from ``.env.auth`` via compose
    ``env_file``, so a hash visible only to this process would suppress the mint
    and leave the user unable to log in. Likewise a plaintext password is read
    only from the project ``.env`` file, never from the process environment — a
    stray exported variable must not silently become a deployed credential.

    A write failure (read-only ``.env.auth``, unwritable project root) is
    reported through ``missing`` rather than raised, so the deploy path's
    fail-closed gate produces the abort with its own context. Nothing is printed
    for a password that could not be persisted.

    Args:
        usernames: Roster usernames, typically ``entry["name"]`` for each
            ``normalize_users`` entry. Order is preserved; a name repeated
            verbatim is one user listed twice and is processed once.

    Existing values always win, making this idempotent — re-minting would

    must be minted a fresh credential instead of silently inheriting the
    departed user's password. Both the hash entry and any plaintext entry that
    was placed in ``.env.auth`` by hand are removed; every other line —
    comments, blank lines, other users' entries — is preserved line-for-line.
    Line *content* is untouched, but the file is rewritten with LF endings and
    a trailing newline, so CRLF input is normalized on the way out.

    The rewrite is atomic (temporary file plus rename) so an interrupted purge
    cannot leave a truncated credential file, and the replacement is 0600 like
    the original.

    Unlike :func:`ensure_auth_credentials` this does not validate ``username``:
    removing entries for a name the roster should never have accepted is always
    safe, and a lifecycle teardown must not be blocked by the departing user's
    spelling.

    Args:
        username: The roster username whose entries should be removed.
        project_root: Directory holding ``.env.auth``.

    Returns:
        ``True`` if the file changed, ``False`` if it was absent or held no
        entry for that user. The deploy path force-recreates the sidecar on
        ``True`` for the same reason :attr:`AuthCredentialsResult.changed`
        exists.

    The rotation entry point behind ``osprey users passwd <user>``, and the only
    operation in this module that deliberately overwrites an established
    credential — :func:`ensure_auth_credentials` exists precisely never to do
    that.

    **Replaces in place; never appends.** The user's existing entry is
    substituted where it already sits — every other line, including other users'
    entries, the signing secrets and the headers, is preserved byte for byte —
    and the file is rewritten exactly once. Appending a second entry would also
    "work", since the parser takes the last assignment, but every rotation would
    leave the superseded credential sitting in the file: correctness would rest
    on parse order rather than on content, a hash an operator believed retired
    would still be readable, and a facility rotating on a schedule would grow
    this file without bound.

    Whitespace is stripped before hashing, matching the plaintext path in
    :func:`ensure_auth_credentials`, so a password set through ``.env`` and one
    set here behave identically at the login prompt.

    Every live session of that user dies as a consequence, with no revocation
    bookkeeping: a session cookie carries the credential-generation tag of the
    hash it was issued against (see
    :func:`osprey.services.auth_sidecar.passwords.generation_tag`), and a new
    hash necessarily produces a different tag.

    **This function RAISES on a write failure, and that is a deliberate
    divergence from the rest of this module — do not "harmonize" it.**
    :func:`ensure_auth_credentials` and :func:`ensure_auth_session_secrets`
    report through a ``missing`` tuple because they run on the deploy path,
    where a fail-closed gate downstream owns the abort and can name the whole
    deployment's context. Nothing downstream owns this one: it is reached from
    an interactive command, and an operator who was just prompted for a
    password must never be told it took effect when the file could not be
    written. Because the replacement is a single atomic rewrite, a failure
    leaves the file exactly as it was — the old password keeps working, which
    is the state the raised error describes.

    The password is never logged, and never appears in a return value or an
    exception message.

    Args:
        username: Roster username whose password is being replaced.
        password: The new cleartext password; hashed here and never stored.
        project_root: Directory holding ``.env.auth``.

    Returns:
        The path of the ``.env.auth`` that now holds the new hash. Returning at
        all means the credential is in force once the sidecar is recreated,
        which is the caller's next obligation.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If ``username`` is outside the roster charset, or if
            ``.env.auth`` could not be written — the message says plainly that
