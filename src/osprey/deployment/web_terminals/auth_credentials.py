"""Deploy-time provisioning of per-user web-terminal auth credentials.

Owns ``.env.auth``: the 0600 project-root file holding one
``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_HASH_<USER>`` entry per roster user, referenced ONLY by the
auth sidecar's compose ``env_file`` so an auth secret never reaches a per-user
agent container. :func:`ensure_auth_credentials` establishes a hash for every
roster user; :func:`purge_auth_credentials` removes a departed user's entries so
a re-added same-name user gets a fresh credential rather than inheriting the
previous holder's password.

Provisioning follows the "existing value wins, append what's missing"
convention of the service-token writer
(``osprey.deployment.container_lifecycle._ensure_service_tokens``): re-running a
deploy never rewrites a hash that is already there, so the operation is
idempotent and pre-existing sessions survive a routine deploy.

Two namespaces live under the ``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_`` stem and are deliberately
kept in different files: plaintext ``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_<USER>`` is read from the
project ``.env`` as a convenience input and is hashed on the way in, while
``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_HASH_<USER>`` is written to (and read from) ``.env.auth``.
Only the latter is ever handed to a container, so a plaintext password set for
convenience never ships.

One further per-user secret lives here without living in ``.env.auth``: the
web-terminal handshake secret (:func:`ensure_terminal_secrets`), keyed
``OSPREY_TERMINAL_SECRET_<USER>`` and minted into the deploy ``.env``. It is
provisioned by the same "existing value wins" rule and by the same suffix
mapping, which is why it is written beside its siblings rather than in a module
of its own — but it is a different *file*, because two services (nginx and that
user's own terminal) must both read it, and ``.env.auth`` exists precisely to be
mounted by neither.

Username validity is enforced *here* as a hard raise rather than left to lint:
``osprey up`` never runs lint, and two usernames that normalize onto one
env-var suffix (``alice-b`` and ``alice_b``) would silently share a single hash
— one operator's password opening the other's terminal, the exact isolation
failure this feature exists to prevent.

       An entry present but *empty* (``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_HASH_ALICE=``) does not
       count as established: that user falls through to the steps below and the
       freshly written entry, appended after the empty one, is the one the
       parser returns (last assignment wins). An empty value would otherwise
       leave a roster user permanently unable to log in.
    2. Otherwise a plaintext ``OSPREY_AUTH_PW_<USER>`` in the project ``.env``
       is hashed in. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed before hashing,
       so a value padded by an editor or a copy-paste hashes to what the
       operator will actually type at the login prompt; a password whose real
       content is only whitespace is treated as absent. The plaintext stays in
       ``.env`` (which no container receives on the auth path) and is never
       echoed: the operator already knows it.
    3. Otherwise a random password is minted, hashed, and printed **once**.
       That print is the only moment the password exists in cleartext output;
       it is never logged, and only its hash is persisted, so it cannot be
       recovered afterwards.

    Neither the process environment nor ``.env`` is consulted for a *hash*: the
    sidecar reads its credentials solely from ``.env.auth`` via compose
    ``env_file``, so a hash visible only to this process would suppress the mint
    and leave the user unable to log in. Likewise a plaintext password is read
    only from the project ``.env`` file, never from the process environment — a
    stray exported variable must not silently become a deployed credential.

    A write failure (read-only ``.env.auth``, unwritable project root) is
    reported through ``missing`` rather than raised, so the deploy path's
    fail-closed gate produces the abort with its own context. Nothing is printed

    Both secrets are minted through the shared service-token recipe
    (``token_urlsafe(32)``, 256 bits) rather than a private generator here, and
    the effective value is checked against the same registered-constraint

    ``OSPREY_AUTH_STATE_SECRET`` is minted unconditionally even though the
    sidecar only requires it in ``oidc`` mode, so that switching a deployment's
    method to ``oidc`` cannot 503 on a secret nobody remembered to add.

    Existing values always win, making this idempotent — re-minting would
    invalidate every live session. The one exception is a present-but-empty (or
    whitespace-only) value, which is re-minted: the sidecar strips and rejects
    such a value as missing configuration and answers every request with 503,

    same judgement ``_ensure_service_tokens`` makes about the tokens it mints —
    a machine-generated secret has no meaningful empty state, so a blank is a
    blank rather than a decision to honour.

    The deploy ``.env`` is append-only to
    :func:`~osprey.utils.dotenv.append_profile_env` — a key already in the file
    is never rewritten, which is what protects an operator's secrets from a
    re-deploy. This is the one narrow exception to that, and it works by
    *removal* rather than by rewriting a value: the callers either have nothing
    to preserve (a departed user's secret) or are about to append a replacement
    (a blank value that must be re-minted), and a line that is gone cannot be
    the one a later parse returns.

    ALL assignments of a target variable go, not just the last one. A file where
    the same variable is assigned twice would otherwise keep a superseded line
    that a differently-ordered reader could still pick up.

    Comments, blank lines, and every other variable's lines are preserved
    verbatim. The rewrite goes through
    :func:`~osprey.utils.dotenv.atomic_write`, so a reader sees either the whole

    function enforces on a file holding facility secrets.

    The read, the filter and the replace happen under

    :func:`~osprey.utils.dotenv.append_profile_env` takes, which is the whole
    point. The deploy ``.env`` is appended to by several unrelated writers
    (``osprey up`` persisting a minted service token, ``osprey build`` writing
    its derived keys, profile seeding), and a locked append landing between an
    unlocked read here and its replace would be discarded without a trace. The
    lock is re-entrant, so a caller that already holds it — to make a drop and
    the append that replaces it one critical section — is not blocked here.

    The emptiness check runs BEFORE the lock: a file with nothing to remove is
    not rewritten at all, so it needs no lock, and taking one would create a
    ``.lock`` file (and fail on a read-only directory) for a call that does

    The per-user half of the terminal's own front door: nginx stamps this value
    onto every request it proxies to that user's terminal, and the terminal
    refuses anything arriving without it. One secret per user rather than one
    per deployment, so a value leaked from one container cannot be replayed
    against a neighbour's terminal.

    Written to the deploy ``.env``, NOT to ``.env.auth``. Both nginx and the
    per-user terminal must read it, and ``.env.auth`` is by construction the
    file only the auth sidecar mounts; the deploy ``.env`` is what compose
    interpolates ``${OSPREY_TERMINAL_SECRET_<USER>}`` from for both services.

    Called on the deploy preflight path for EVERY deployment, including one with
    one without a sidecar. Authentication decides who may reach a terminal
    through the front door; this secret decides that the front door is the only
    way in at all, which an auth-off multi-user deployment needs just as much —
    arguably more, since nothing else stands between one user's browser and
    another user's terminal port.

    Per user, in precedence order:

    1. A non-empty value already in the deploy ``.env`` wins and is left exactly
       as it is. Re-deploying is therefore idempotent, and an operator who
       pinned a secret by hand keeps it.
    2. A present-but-empty (or whitespace-only) value is RE-MINTED, and its
       existing line(s) are removed first — ``append_profile_env`` would
       otherwise refuse to touch a key already in the file, leaving the user
       with a blank secret their terminal reads as "no secret configured". A
       machine-generated secret has no meaningful empty state, the same
       judgement :func:`ensure_auth_session_secrets` makes about the signing
       secrets.
    3. Otherwise a fresh secret is minted through the shared service-token
       recipe (``token_urlsafe(32)``, 256 bits), so it is generated and checked
       exactly like every other deploy-time secret and picks up any constraint
       registered for it later.

    Neither the process environment nor any other file is consulted: compose
    interpolates the compose file's ``${...}`` references from the deploy
    ``.env``, so a value visible only to this process is not the one that will
    be in force, and suppressing the mint on account of it would deploy a
    terminal whose secret nobody holds.

    A write failure is reported through ``missing`` rather than raised, matching
    :func:`ensure_auth_credentials` and :func:`ensure_auth_session_secrets` so
    the deploy gate owns the abort and can name the deployment's context.

    Args:
        project_root: Directory holding the deploy ``.env``.

    Returns:

        which were already established, and which are still unusable.

    Called when a user is decommissioned or pruned: a re-added same-name user
    must be minted a fresh credential instead of silently inheriting the
    departed user's password. Both the hash entry and any plaintext entry that
    was placed in ``.env.auth`` by hand are removed; every other line —
    comments, blank lines, other users' entries — is preserved line-for-line.
    Line *content* is untouched, but the file is rewritten with LF endings and
    a trailing newline, so CRLF input is normalized on the way out.

    The rewrite is atomic (temporary file plus rename) so an interrupted purge
    cannot leave a truncated credential file, and the replacement is 0600 like
    the original.

    Unlike :func:`ensure_auth_credentials` this does not validate ``username``:
    removing entries for a name the roster should never have accepted is always
    safe, and a lifecycle teardown must not be blocked by the departing user's
    spelling.

        username: The roster username whose entries should be removed.

    The rotation entry point behind ``osprey users passwd <user>``, and the only
    operation in this module that deliberately overwrites an established
    credential — :func:`ensure_auth_credentials` exists precisely never to do
    that.

    **Replaces in place; never appends.** The user's existing entry is
    substituted where it already sits — every other line, including other users'
    entries, the signing secrets and the headers, is preserved byte for byte —
    and the file is rewritten exactly once. Appending a second entry would also
    "work", since the parser takes the last assignment, but every rotation would
    leave the superseded credential sitting in the file: correctness would rest
    on parse order rather than on content, a hash an operator believed retired
    would still be readable, and a facility rotating on a schedule would grow
    this file without bound.

    Whitespace is stripped before hashing, matching the plaintext path in
    :func:`ensure_auth_credentials`, so a password set through ``.env`` and one
    set here behave identically at the login prompt.

    Every live session of that user dies as a consequence, with no revocation
    bookkeeping: a session cookie carries the credential-generation tag of the
    hash it was issued against (see
    :func:`osprey.services.auth_sidecar.passwords.generation_tag`), and a new
    hash necessarily produces a different tag.

    **This function RAISES on a write failure, and that is a deliberate
    divergence from the rest of this module — do not "harmonize" it.**
    :func:`ensure_auth_credentials` and :func:`ensure_auth_session_secrets`
    report through a ``missing`` tuple because they run on the deploy path,
    where a fail-closed gate downstream owns the abort and can name the whole
    deployment's context. Nothing downstream owns this one: it is reached from
    an interactive command, and an operator who was just prompted for a
    password must never be told it took effect when the file could not be
    written. Because the replacement is a single atomic rewrite, a failure
    leaves the file exactly as it was — the old password keeps working, which
    is the state the raised error describes.

    The password is never logged, and never appears in a return value or an
    exception message.

    Args:
        username: Roster username whose password is being replaced.
        password: The new cleartext password; hashed here and never stored.
        project_root: Directory holding ``.env.auth``.

    Returns:
        The path of the ``.env.auth`` that now holds the new hash. Returning at
        all means the credential is in force once the sidecar is recreated,
        which is the caller's next obligation.

        RuntimeError: If ``username`` is outside the roster charset, or if
            ``.env.auth`` could not be written — the message says plainly that
