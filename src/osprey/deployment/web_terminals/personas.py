"""Roster and persona identity resolution for multi-user web terminal deployments.

Turns the raw ``modules.web_terminals`` roster into explicit per-user identity:
normalized ``{"name", "index"}`` entries (:func:`normalize_users`) and fully
resolved image/project/container-dir identity per user
(:func:`resolve_personas`). Callers that write the roster *back* to

(:func:`env_var_suffix_collisions`), which credential provisioning, the auth
sidecar and lint share so a user's credentials are keyed identically everywhere.

def normalize_users(users_raw: Any) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Normalize ``modules.web_terminals.users`` into explicit ``{"name", "index"}`` dicts.

    This is the canonical users-normalizer for the module; render.py delegates to it
    directly rather than re-parsing the raw roster itself. Its purpose is to let a
    decommission migration *freeze* a bare roster's positional indices onto explicit
    ``index`` fields before removing a user — once frozen, deleting an earlier entry
    can no longer shift a later user's port allocation, because the survivor's index
    no longer depends on its position in the list.

    Legacy bare strings (``"alice"``) normalize to ``{"name": "alice", "index":
    <raw list position>}``, matching the fallback ``render.py`` already uses so
    ports stay identical to what an all-strings roster produces.
    Already-explicit object entries (``{"name": ..., "index": ...}``) pass through
    with their explicit index preserved, regardless of list position. This makes
    the function idempotent: normalizing an already-normalized list is a no-op,
    which is what lets the freeze step be applied without checking whether a
    roster has already been frozen.

    An object entry's optional ``display_name`` (a human-facing window/tab title,
    surfaced downstream as the per-user ``OSPREY_WEB_APP_NAME``) is carried through
    onto the normalized entry when it is a string, and dropped defensively
    otherwise (a non-string ``display_name`` is a config typo, reported separately
    by lint). Bare-string entries never carry one. Keeping this passthrough here
    means the normalized entry stays the single object :func:`resolve_personas`
    reads a user's identity off of, rather than re-deriving the field from the raw
    roster the way ``persona`` is.

    An object entry's optional ``theme`` (that user's default web UI theme --
    a theme family like ``desy`` or a concrete id like ``desy-light``, surfaced
    downstream as the per-user ``OSPREY_WEB_THEME``) is carried through on
    exactly the same terms. Validity of the *value* is not checked here: the
    web terminal resolves it at startup and warns+falls back on an unknown one,
    and lint reports a non-string separately.

    An object entry's optional ``oidc_subject`` (the value of the configured OIDC
    claim -- ``sub`` by default -- that identifies this roster user at the IdP) is
    carried through on the same terms, with one deliberate difference: an *empty*
    string is dropped along with every non-string, where ``display_name`` and
    ``theme`` would keep it. This field is an authorization mapping, not a
    cosmetic one -- carrying ``""`` through would let an identity whose claim is
    missing or empty match a roster user. Dropping it instead leaves that user
    with no mapping at all, which the callback answers with 403. Only the
    *non-secret* side of the mapping ever lives in config.yml; password hashes
    never do (they live in ``.env.auth``, keyed by :func:`env_var_suffix`).

    An object entry's optional ``login`` (whether this entry sits behind the
    deployment's login wall when authentication is enabled) is carried through
    only when it is the literal boolean ``False`` — the one value that changes
    anything. ``true``, absence, and every malformed spelling all mean "login
    required", so dropping them is both the fail-closed reading and what keeps
    a config typo from silently opening an entry to the world (lint reports
    the typo separately). See :func:`entry_requires_login` for the single
    consumer-side reading of the carried key.

    Malformed entries — anything that isn't a string, and any dict missing a
    string ``name`` or an int ``index`` — are dropped rather than raising
    (well-formedness is lint.py's job). ``bool`` is a subclass of ``int`` in
    Python, so a dict entry
    like ``{"name": "alice", "index": True}`` would technically satisfy
    ``isinstance(index, int)``; this function deliberately treats ``bool`` as an
    invalid index type and drops such entries, since ``index: true/false`` in a
    facility config is a config typo (e.g. a YAML boolean where an int was meant),
    not a meaningful index.

    Args:
        users_raw: The raw ``modules.web_terminals.users`` value. Anything other
            than a list (including ``None``) is treated as an empty roster.

    surviving entry's ``persona`` field (which :func:`normalize_users` discards)
    from the raw roster by matching on ``name``.

    A ``persona`` reference resolves in this order: the entry's own ``persona:``
    key, else ``modules.web_terminals.default_persona``, else ``None`` (no persona
    system in effect for this entry at all — every config predating persona
    catalogs resolves this way for every entry). Resolving against the catalog
    (``modules.web_terminals.personas.<name>: {project, project_path,
    build_profile}``) then follows these naming rules. In registry mode every
    image carries the tag :func:`resolve_image_tag` resolves from
    ``modules.web_terminals.image_tag`` (``<tag>`` below, default ``latest``);
    local ``:local`` images are unaffected by that field:

    * **No persona in effect** (``persona`` is ``None``): the facility defaults —
      ``image`` is ``<registry_url>/web-terminal:<tag>`` (unsuffixed, the same
      string the compose template names directly whenever ``<tag>`` is its
      ``latest`` default),
      ``project`` and ``container_project_dir`` are ``<facility_prefix>-assistant``
      / ``/app/<facility_prefix>-assistant``. This is the zero-migration path: a
      config with no ``personas`` catalog at all resolves every entry here.
    * **Default persona** (resolved ``persona`` equals ``default_persona``, and
      a catalog entry exists for it): registry mode keeps the same un-suffixed
      ``<registry_url>/web-terminal:<tag>`` image (so the default persona's
      *image* never changes when a catalog is introduced); local mode still
      builds ``<persona.project>-<persona>:local`` like every other persona.
      ``container_project_dir`` is ``/app/<project>`` from the catalog entry,
      exactly as for any other persona: the image is built FROM that project, so
      pinning the directory to the facility default would name a path that
      image does not have. A catalog that gives the default persona a project
      other than ``<facility_prefix>-assistant`` therefore moves where its
      users' agent-data volume mounts — the volume itself is unchanged and
      keeps its contents, but they are no longer at the path the container
      reads.
    * **Non-default persona**: registry mode uses
      ``<registry_url>/web-terminal-<persona>:<tag>``; local mode uses
      ``<persona.project>-<persona>:local`` (same rule as the default persona);
      ``container_project_dir`` is derived from the persona's own
      ``/app/<project>``.

        facility_prefix: ``facility.prefix``, used for the zero-migration /
            default-persona project dir and image (``<prefix>-assistant``).
        strict: When ``True`` (render/build/seed callers), an unresolvable
            persona reference — an explicit or inherited ``persona:`` naming a
            catalog entry that doesn't exist, or ``image_source: local`` with no
            catalog/``default_persona`` configured at all — raises
            ``ValueError``. When ``False`` (lifecycle verbs), the same
            conditions degrade gracefully: an unresolved entry falls back to the
            zero-migration values (so a stale/bad persona reference never blocks
            ``decommission``/``prune``/``nuke``) instead of raising.

    Returns:
        One ``{"name", "index", "persona", "image", "project",
        "container_project_dir", "extra_mounts", "seed_base"}`` dict per
        surviving :func:`normalize_users` entry, in the same order. ``persona``
        is the resolved catalog key, or ``None`` when no persona is in effect for
        that entry. ``extra_mounts`` is the persona's ``extra_mounts`` list
        (compose volume strings applied to every user of that persona),
        defaulting to ``[]`` — both when no persona is in effect and when the
        catalog entry sets none. ``seed_base`` is the catalog entry's
        ``seed_base`` (a bool; anything else is defensively coerced to
        ``True``), and always ``True`` for the zero-migration / lenient-degrade
        paths — it controls whether the shared base context is prepended when
        seeding this entry's ``CLAUDE.md``. Optional ``"display_name"`` and
        ``"theme"`` keys are added — carried through from
        :func:`normalize_users` — only when the entry declared a non-empty string
        one (render emits them as ``OSPREY_WEB_APP_NAME`` and
        ``OSPREY_WEB_THEME``); each is omitted entirely otherwise, so a roster
        declaring neither resolves byte-identically to before these fields
        existed. An optional ``"oidc_subject"`` key rides through on the same
        terms, so the auth sidecar's roster→identity mapping is read off the same
        resolved entry as everything else rather than re-derived from the raw
        roster. An optional ``"login": False`` marker rides through likewise —
        present only when the roster entry opted out of the login wall (see

    does not rebuild (rebuilding is a separate operator step), so a persona's
    config edited after its last build does not change what its image actually
    ships. A caller that asked the config instead would see a permission set
    that has never been rendered: an operator who removed ``Bash`` from
    ``remove_deny`` would read as safe while the running image still permits the
    shell.

    The scope of that claim is the rendered project directory, which is what
    ``COPY . /app/<project>/`` bakes into the persona image — so what this reads
    equals the image's own ``.claude/settings.json`` **as of that image's last

    :func:`settings_json_denies_bash`. Membership is inclusive for the same
    fail-closed reason: a persona with no ``project_path``, or one whose project
    is not rendered, is reported here as not denying ``Bash``. That never
    over-blocks a deploy, since a persona whose project is missing cannot
    satisfy :func:`config_needs_launch_token` either and so drops out of the
    intersection anyway.

    Args:
        config: The parsed deploy config.
        project_root: Deploy project root; relative ``project_path`` values
            resolve against it.

    Returns:
        The subset of referenced persona names whose rendered
        ``.claude/settings.json`` does not deny the shell.
