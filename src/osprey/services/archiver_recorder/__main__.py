"""Container entry point: ``python -m osprey.services.archiver_recorder``.

Startup is deliberately fail-fast. Everything the recorder cannot invent — the
config, the store, the credential, the channel list — is resolved here, before
the loop begins, so a misconfigured deployment says so in ``docker logs``
within seconds instead of running as a service that quietly writes nothing.

What is NOT fatal here is the control system being something other than the one
recorded: that is the ordinary state of a mock deployment, and the service is
supposed to sit there idling until someone flips it.
