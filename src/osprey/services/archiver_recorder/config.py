"""What the recorder reads out of a deployment's rendered ``config.yml``.

Two blocks, both written by the profile's ``va_archiver:`` block (see
``osprey/cli/build_profile_archiver.py``) and neither duplicated here:

* ``archiver.mongodb_archiver.*`` — where the store is and how to authenticate,
  the same keys ``MongoDBArchiverConnector`` reads, so the writer and the reader
  cannot end up pointed at different collections.
* ``va_archiver.*`` — the cadences and retention spans that decide the shape of
  what gets written.

Nothing in this package carries a default for either. A missing key is an
error naming the key, not a silent fallback: a recorder that invented its own
cadence would write an archive whose density disagreed with the seeded half of
the very same collection, and nothing downstream would notice.

One value here does not come from the file: the store's address. The rendered
connection block is written for the HOST side — the agent runs there and reaches
the store on loopback at its published port — which inside the compose network
names this container's own loopback. The compose template hands the container
the store's network alias and container port instead, and those win.

That override is NOT defined here. It is read through
``MongoDBArchiverConnector``'s :func:`~osprey.connectors.archiver.mongodb_archiver_connector.address_overrides`,
where the contract is stated, so this service and the agent's connector cannot
drift apart on the variable names, on what an empty value means, or on how the
port is typed. Two readers of one convention have to agree on its edges.

Settings are resolved once. The one thing re-read on every poll is
:class:`RecordingFacts` — who is on the other end of the Channel Access
connection — and it is read out of the same file through the same resolvers the
roster and the target switch use, for the same reason: a guard that works out
privately what the reader it guards resolves can disagree with it, and the
disagreement is the bypass.

    Nothing here asks whether ``live`` is secretly something else — the stand-in
    is its own ``standin`` target, and an operator on it is told ``standin``.
    The question is whose history the store this recorder writes into already
    holds, and that is
    :func:`~osprey_connectors.standin.archive_belongs_to_standin`: a deployment
    that stood a stand-in up *and* runs this recorder records the stand-in,
    because the machine whose present is sampled and the machine whose past was
    seeded are then the same one. Neither conjunct is restated here — the
    recorder's compose entry and the deploy-time seed bind to that same
    predicate, and three readings of one question are three chances to disagree
    about a single collection.

    The predicate decides *whether*; the derivation decides *where*, and it
    reads the ``standin`` target — its own ``control_system.connector.live_standin``
    block — never the facility's authored ``epics`` block, which always means
    the real machine. The endpoint is derived by

    and judged by
    :func:`~osprey.mcp_server.control_system.target_eligibility.endpoint_is_live_standin`,
    the same step the roster's label is minted through, so a recorder cannot
    believe it is sampling a stand-in while an operator is told otherwise.

    A ``standin`` block whose gateways have been moved off this host is a real
    machine, whatever the deployment once stood up, and recording it into a
    synthesized past is the one thing an archive must never hold — so that
