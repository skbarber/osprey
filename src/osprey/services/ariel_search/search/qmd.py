"""ARIEL hybrid search module, backed by the qmd sidecar.

Answers a search request from the qmd sidecar's ARIEL mirror collection rather
than from Postgres. The sidecar indexes the markdown tree that the ``qmd_export``
enhancement writes — one ``<mirror>/YYYY/MM/<percent-encoded entry_id>.md`` file
per row — so a hit names a file, not a database row, and this module's job is to
turn the one into the other.

Four properties of that job are load-bearing:

**qmd ranks, Postgres is authoritative.** A hit contributes exactly two things:
its position in the ranking and its snippet. Every field the caller sees is
re-read from ``enhanced_entries`` by primary key, so a mirror file that has
drifted from its row cannot put stale text in front of an operator. A hit whose
row is gone is dropped: the index is a copy of the database and is allowed to lag
it.

**The document names itself; the reported path does not.** Hydration reads the
``entry_id`` out of the hit's title, which is the ``# Entry <entry_id>`` heading
the mirror writer put in the document. It deliberately does **not** invert the
path qmd reports, because qmd does not report the filename it indexed: it
slugifies it, mapping both ``%`` and ``_`` to ``-``, collapsing runs and dropping
a leading one. Inverting that is lossy twice over — an id needing any escape
comes back as a key no row has, and ``beam_current_setpoint`` and
``beam-current-setpoint`` collapse onto a single reported path, so inverting it
hydrates one of them to the *other's* row. A wrong entry in front of an operator
is worse than a missing one, so a hit whose title declares no identifier is
dropped rather than guessed at, and a path that disagrees with the title is
logged.

**Post-filters over-fetch.** Date, author and source-system filters cannot be
pushed into the qmd query — the sidecar indexes prose, not columns — so they run
after hydration. Fetching exactly ``max_results`` candidates and then filtering
would starve the result set, so a filtered query asks the sidecar for
:data:`OVERFETCH_FACTOR` times as many hits, capped at
:data:`MAX_FETCH_LIMIT`.

**Reranking is the deployment's choice, not this module's.** qmd's LLM reranker
reads every candidate, so a reranked query is markedly slower than a plain one,
at a cost driven by the candidate pool that grows far more slowly than the
corpus does. One key — ``search_modules.hybrid.settings.rerank`` — governs both
surfaces this module serves: the agent-facing tool, whose ``rerank`` argument
overrides the key for the one call, and the search panel, whose toggle opens
showing the configured value and whose click overrides it for that session's
later searches, until Reset, rather than changing the config. The default is
qmd's own (``True``), because an agent has no interactive budget to blow; a
deployment that wants the fast path sets the key to ``false``. Reranking is also not load-bearing for correctness: a query whose
rerank fails degrades to the non-reranked ordering rather than failing.

        probability** — do not threshold it. ``snippets`` carries qmd's
        line-numbered, match-centered excerpt, or is empty when the sidecar
        supplied none.

        With `query_expansion`: a `ModuleOutput` carrying those same tuples as
        `entries` and the applied expansion groups as `expansion`. The shape is
        conditional so that direct callers keep the return value they have
        always received; the service unwraps either form.

        A `ModuleOutput` is also returned — with or without an expansion —

    writes ``# Entry <entry_id>`` as the document's first line and qmd surfaces
    that heading verbatim, so the identifier arrives as the writer spelled it.

    The value is used **as-is and never percent-decoded**. The heading carries
    the raw identifier, not the encoded filename, so decoding it would corrupt
    every id that merely looks encoded — ``a%2Fb`` would silently become ``a/b``.
