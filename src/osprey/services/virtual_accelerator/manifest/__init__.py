"""Namespace-union manifest generator for the PyAT virtual accelerator.

The Control Assistant Tutorial's channel-finder databases already define the
channel namespace the virtual accelerator must serve: the tutorial ships
three interchangeable file "paradigm" formats (in_context, hierarchical,
middle_layer) that describe the same set of PV addresses under the grammar
``{ring}:{system}:{family}:{device}:{field}:{subfield}``. The ``graph``
paradigm is deliberately not among them -- it answers from a seeded store
rather than a tier file, so it contributes no manifest source.

This package expands all three file formats at their build-resolved tier,
verifies they agree, unions in the scenario-seed ``machine.json`` channels,
reconciles the machine-state template against the result, and classifies
every address into a physics-fidelity partition (pyat-coupled / sp-echo /
static-noisy) plus an EPICS record type. The served channel set is derived
from these sources -- never hand-listed.

See :func:`build.build_manifest` for the entry point.
