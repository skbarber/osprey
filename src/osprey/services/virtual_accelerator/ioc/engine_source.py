"""Drives partition (c) ("static/noisy") IOC records from the in-image
SimulationEngine, and detects scenario switches on the bind-mounted scenario
state directory.

Partition (c) is everything the record factory (``serving.pvdb``) builds as a
plain read-only record with no wired write behavior -- GOLDEN references,
STATUS flags, temperatures, pressures, and any other channel with no lattice
physics and no SP->RB echo pairing. This module is their only value source:
on each poll tick it reads the effective value for every partition-(c)
address through the SAME :class:`~osprey.simulation.engine.SimulationEngine`
used by the mock connector (never a second implementation -- see the module
docstring on ``engine.py``), and pushes it onto the record with ``.set()``.

Not every partition-(c) address is necessarily defined in the bind-mounted
``machine.json`` (only a scenario-relevant subset is -- see
``machine-json-lattice-augment``); addresses the engine doesn't serve fall
back to the same generic channel-taxonomy synthesis the mock connector itself uses
for unknown channels (``osprey.connectors.channel_taxonomy.classify_channel``), so mock
and VA present identical values for anything neither one has real data for.

Scenario-switch detection deliberately does its own (mtime, content-hash)
comparison of ``active_scenarios`` in addition to the engine's own internal
mtime-only tracking: the data directory is bind-mounted (not a single file)
specifically so an atomic-rename swap survives the mount, but the replacement
file's mtime can still collide with the replaced one at the host filesystem's
mtime granularity. The content hash is strictly more sensitive than mtime
alone and catches that edge case.

    """Poll-driven bridge from a :class:`SimulationEngine` to a set of
    partition-(c) IOC records.

    Args:
        engine: The in-image simulation engine, already loaded from the
            bind-mounted ``machine.json``.
        channels: The namespace-union manifest's ``channels`` list (or any
            subset covering the addresses in ``static_noisy_records``) --
            used to look up each address's ``record_type``/``noise`` flag for
            the legacy-fallback synthesis path.
        static_noisy_records: The ``static_noisy`` dict from
            :func:`serving.pvdb.build_serving_pvdb` -- address -> read-only
            record shim. This instance drives exactly these records; addresses in
            ``channels`` that aren't also keys here are ignored.
        data_dir: The bind-mounted ``data/simulation/`` directory (the mount
            unit holding ``machine.json``).
        state_dir: Directory holding the ``active_scenarios`` file, read fresh
            on every poll tick -- never through a cached file handle, so a
            directory-level atomic-rename swap is always observed. Defaults to
            ``data_dir`` (the single-directory layout). The VA entrypoint points it
            at the separately mounted ``_agent_data/simulation/`` the host
            writes, and passes the SAME directory to the engine, so the two
            never disagree about which scenarios are active.
        noise_level: Relative noise fraction for the legacy-fallback
            synthesis path (mirrors ``MockConnector``'s own default).
        setpoint_echo_records: Optional ``address -> record`` map of sp-echo
            READBACK records whose current values are synced into the engine
            (``engine.write``) at the top of every poll tick, BEFORE the
            driven records are computed. This is what lets a machine-file
            expression channel (e.g. a camera response curve) depend on the
            latest accepted setpoint state when the engine is the only
            physics in the process -- the no-lattice entrypoint path wires
            it. With a PhysicsBridge, physics coupling flows through the
            bridge instead and this stays ``None`` (the default; behaviour
            unchanged). Addresses the engine does not serve are dropped at
            construction.
