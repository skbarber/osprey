"""Manifest -> co-hosted process-variable database, plus the record shims.

The serving layer hands a Channel Access server one *process-variable
database* (``pvdb``): a plain ``{name: spec}`` dict describing every PV's
type, element count, initial value and display limits. This module is the
only place that translates the namespace-union channel manifest
(``manifest.build_manifest()["channels"]``) into that shape. It owns no
physics, opens no socket, and imports neither the CA server library nor the
LUME serving package -- it produces data plus a thin per-channel shim, and
the runner injects both into the server it hosts.

Two consumers already exist and are deliberately not changed by this module:
``ioc.engine_source.EngineSource`` (1 Hz telemetry) and
``ioc.physics_bridge.PhysicsBridge`` (BPM readbacks after a solve). Both
drive their records through exactly two calls -- ``record.set(value)`` and
``record.get()`` -- so :class:`PVRecord` reproduces that surface and they
plug in unchanged. That surface is also what makes the second transport
free: a value source pushes once, and the shim fans that one push out to
every view of the address, so neither source knows how many transports it
is feeding.

Four properties of the served database are contracts, not preferences:

* **The channel set is closed.** One PV per manifest channel, no more, no
  fewer: the pinned counts (348 SR magnet ``:SP`` / 348 paired ``:RB`` /
  144 BPM readings / 2,908 channels total) are what clients, the channel
  finder databases and the safety limits file all agree on. This module
  adds no diagnostic or control PV of its own.
* **Drive limits are not alarm limits.** ``drive_limits`` becomes
  ``lolim``/``hilim`` (the CA *control/display* band, what DRVL/DRVH mean
  to a client). The alarm-limit keys (``lolo``/``low``/``high``/``hihi``)
  are never emitted, so a value clamped to the top of its band reads back
  ``NO_ALARM`` rather than a limit violation -- clamping is a normal,
  non-alarming outcome. Leaving those four keys unset is exactly what
  disables the server's alarm evaluation: it only compares against them
  when ``lolo < hihi`` (resp. ``low < high``), which the shared default of
  0.0 never satisfies.
* **No PV uses the server's own ``scan`` field.** A scanning PV is polled
  by the server and is *skipped* by the driver-side monitor post, so a
  served value pushed with :meth:`PVRecord.set` on a scanning PV would
  silently never reach a subscriber. Every value here is driver-posted;
  none is server-scanned.
* **No channel type moves on one transport and not the other.** Some of
  these addresses are served twice: on Channel Access from this database,
  and on PVA because the same address is also a model variable. Every push
  through :meth:`PVRecord.set` reaches both, so a BPM reading, a telemetry
  value and a setpoint echo all move together wherever they are watched --
  and :meth:`ServingRecords.attach_driver` reconciles them at boot, because
  the two servers seed their first value from different places. A view that
  tracked setpoints but not readings, or agreed only once something moved,
  would be worse than one that tracked nothing: it would *look* correct.
