"""The runner that serves the virtual accelerator's whole namespace.

One process, one model, one Channel Access server. :class:`CohostRunner`
takes the serving package's runner -- which knows how to serve a
:class:`~lume.model.LUMEModel`'s own variables -- and co-hosts the
facility's entire channel manifest alongside them, so a client sees one
namespace of ~2,900 channels rather than the handful a model happens to
describe. Everything specific to that arrangement is here; what a write to
a setpoint *means* is in
:mod:`~osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.serving.write_path`, which
imports no server library and is therefore testable without one.

**This module imports the CA server extension.** It is reached lazily
(``serving.runner``, never an eager re-export) precisely so that importing
the serving package stays cheap; see the package docstring.

Four decisions shape the subclass:

*The Channel Access namespace is contributed whole.* Every served CA PV
comes from the manifest-derived database, including the addresses that also
happen to be model variables. The base class would otherwise build a second
CA PV per model variable, from a spec derived from the variable rather than
from the manifest's record-type table -- a duplicate name that the database
merge rejects outright, and, were it not rejected, a BPM served without the
display precision its metre-scale readings need and without the boot value
the physics bridge pushed into the manifest's own spec. So the CA half of
the base class's per-variable PV creation is suppressed and the model's
variables are served on PVA alone.

*No served value derives from a model read.* The run loop's output pass --
read every variable back after a cycle and publish it -- is suppressed
entirely. Readings reach their PVs from the physics bridge instead, which
applies each BPM's seeded readout error to the value it pushes. Publishing
``model.get`` alongside that would overwrite the reading with the truth it
is supposed to differ from, and would do it a fraction of a second later, so
the divergence would come and go rather than hold.

*Every model access happens on the run loop's thread.* The model is
explicitly not thread-safe: two threads writing through it interleave their
lattice mutations and its rollback restores whichever snapshot it happens to
hold. The server thread therefore never touches it -- a co-hosted setpoint
write is enqueued and completed later from the loop -- and the physics hook
is reached through the model wrapper, so it too runs there.

*The runner claims no name of its own.* Control PVs are off: nothing is
served that the facility's channel manifest does not describe.

The model's variables are served on **both** transports -- co-hosted on CA,
natively on PVA -- and keeping those two views of one address in step is the
write path's job, not a model read's: every setpoint PV's put handler is
replaced with one that routes into the same write path the CA driver uses,
and every value that path publishes is committed on both views. So a write
arriving on either transport moves both, and a refused write moves neither.

The one place the two transports differ is how a client is told its write
finished, and there they differ for good reason: Channel Access completion
carries no status, so a refusal is signalled by an alarm and by the absence
of movement, while a PVA put is completed with the model's own error string.

What a client *reads* is synchronised by the same route rather than by a
second mechanism of its own. A BPM reading reaches its Channel Access PV
through the record shim the physics bridge pushes into, and that shim is
handed this module's publisher when its driver is attached, so one push
moves both views. Attaching also reconciles the two onto their boot values,
which are otherwise seeded from different places: Channel Access from the
manifest's PV specs, each PVA channel from the model variable it was built
from. So no channel this module serves moves on one transport and not on
the other -- not a setpoint, not its echo, and not a reading.
