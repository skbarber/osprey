"""Corrector-kick closed-orbit response for the ALS-U AR lattice.

Provides orbit_response(corrector_name, current) -> {bpm_name: (x_m, y_m)}:
applies one corrector's current through the same current->strength formula
:mod:`ioc.physics_bridge` uses (delegated to
:class:`~osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.lattice.strengths.StrengthMap`,
which sets ``KickAngle[plane] = I / AMPS_PER_RADIAN_KICK`` absolute), re-solves
the closed orbit with the guarded :func:`~.solve.solve_orbit` helper, and
returns every BPM's (x, y) reading in meters, keyed by its flat FamName (e.g.
"BPM01"). Sharing both the ring source (`build_ring`) and the strength-map
code path with the bridge is deliberate: it is what lets the ORM crosscheck
prove this oracle and the live IOC agree because they run the same model, not
two independently-written ones.

``solve_orbit`` guards against the unstable-lattice failure mode described in
`solve.py`'s docstring (non-finite/unstable closed orbit surfaces as
`OrbitSolveError`, not a silently-returned garbage orbit); this oracle lets
that exception propagate to its caller uncaught -- a corrector current that
destabilizes the ring has no valid model-oracle answer.
