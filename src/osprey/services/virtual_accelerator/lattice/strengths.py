"""Ring-facing current<->strength mapping for the ALS-U AR virtual accelerator.

Owns the per-device nominal-current baseline (read from the scenario-seed
``machine.json``, no hardcoded currents) and the current->strength formulas
for every magnet and corrector family in the real ring. This module is
deliberately decoupled from the serving layer -- it never imports anything
from :mod:`osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.ioc` or
:mod:`osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.serving` -- so any physics server
can consume it identically.

Apply-current semantics (per family):

- ``HCM``/``VCM`` correctors: ``KickAngle[plane] = I / AMPS_PER_RADIAN_KICK``
  (absolute). Each corrector is its own single-plane element in the real
  ring (see :mod:`osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.lattice.response`):
  an ``HCM`` element writes ``KickAngle[0]``, a ``VCM`` element writes
  ``KickAngle[1]``.
- ``QF``/``QD``/``QFA`` quadrupoles: ``K = K_baked * I / I_nom`` (the baked
  gradient scaled by the fractional current).
- ``DIPOLE``: ``PolynomB[0] = (I / I_nom - 1) * BendingAngle / Length``.
  This is a trim-coil model: the real AR dipoles are combined-function
  bends (nonzero baked ``PolynomB[1]`` gradient), and this only perturbs the
  pure-dipole field-error term (``PolynomB[0]``) -- the baked bending angle
  and gradient are held fixed. At nominal current the field error is
  exactly zero.
- ``SF``/``SD``/``SHF``/``SHD`` sextupoles: ``PolynomB[2] = h_baked * I /
  I_nom`` (the baked sextupole strength scaled by the fractional current).

Baked strengths are snapshotted once, from the ring passed to
:class:`StrengthMap`'s constructor, before any current is applied.

The element-level write-rollback primitives (:class:`ElementState`,
:func:`snapshot_element`, :func:`restore_element`) are facility-agnostic and
live in :mod:`lume_pyat.simulator`; they are re-exported here so a caller
already holding this module for the mapping does not need a second import
to roll a write back.
