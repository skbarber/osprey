"""Seed-time schema snapshot, baked into the graph agent's rendered prompt.

The facility-knowledge-graph agent — and the channel finder in its graph
paradigm, which reads the same store — needs the store's vocabulary: labels,
relationship types, property spellings — before it can write a Cypher query
that returns rows instead of a confident zero. At run time that vocabulary
comes from the ``get_schema`` and ``example_queries`` tools; this module moves
the common case earlier, so a fresh subagent starts already knowing it. Each
agent file is baked with the example catalogue its own server serves.

**The seeder owns the baked block, not the build.** ``osprey build`` renders
the agent prompt before any store exists, so it ships a placeholder that tells
the agent to call the tools. Whichever verb then touches the store — the
deploy-time staging step on every ``osprey up``, or ``osprey knowledge
seed-graph`` — captures the schema *from the live store it just verified* and
rewrites the placeholder in every rendered agent file. Sync between prompt and
store is therefore by construction: the writer of one is the writer of the
other, stamped with the same seed-marker checksum, and a rebuild that resets
the block to the placeholder self-heals on the next ``up``.

The capture is **complete where the tool samples**: ``get_schema`` bounds its
per-label property scan because it answers live queries on request, while this
capture runs once per seed and can afford the full walk. Both go through
:func:`collect_schema`, so the bookkeeping exclusions cannot drift apart.

**Three things are captured, and the block says which is which.** The schema
(:func:`collect_schema`); the facility's own class synonyms
(:func:`collect_vocabulary`), which are authored in its ontology rather than
hard-coded here, so a corpus spelling its classes differently gets its own
spellings; and one specimen device (:func:`resolve_example_values`) whose real
name, section and address are substituted into the curated examples. Each of
the latter two is queried under its own guard: a store that answers the schema
but not them still deploys, the examples keep their shipped literals, and the
block labels those *framework defaults* rather than passing them off as facts
about this corpus.

The tools stay registered regardless. They are the recovery path when a query
returns zero rows for a name the snapshot lists (a store re-seeded out of
band), and the only path on a render whose store was never seeded.

    A file without the marker pair is never appended to. One that still shows
    a trace of the section — the heading, or a lone marker — has been
    hand-edited, and growing an unmarked section in someone's edited prompt is
    worse than leaving the tools to answer at run time, so it is reported and
    left alone. One with no trace at all never shipped the section (the
    channel finder outside its graph paradigm) and is skipped quietly.

    Returns:
        The files now carrying their block (rewritten or already current).
