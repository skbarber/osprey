"""Neo4j/neosemantics graph-store seeding primitives.

Pure functions over an already-open neo4j **driver session**.  Nothing here
reads project config, resolves a TTL path, or decides policy: the connection is
resolved by :mod:`osprey.deployment.graphdb_service` and the five-state seeding
vocabulary (seeded / unchanged / differs / unmanaged-partial / overwritten) is
assembled by the callers — ``osprey knowledge seed-graph`` and the deploy-time
``_stage_graphdb_store`` staging step — from the primitives below.  Keeping the
policy out of this module is what lets both consumers behave identically.

**neo4j is imported lazily** (inside :func:`open_session`), never at module top,
mirroring the ``rdflib`` treatment in :mod:`.ttl_seeder`: importing this module
must not pull the driver into the runtime read path's ``sys.modules``, which is
guarded by ``tests/services/facility_knowledge/test_import_isolation.py``.

Driver-API constraint: the repo's ``neo4j>=5.20`` floor resolves to the 6.x
driver line while the server it dials is pinned to ``neo4j:5.26-community``.
Only APIs present in *both* lines are used — ``session.run()`` and
``result.consume()``/``result.single()``, never ``Session.read_transaction`` /
``Session.write_transaction`` (removed in 6.0).

The canonical n10s graph config and the NARAD prefix table are spelled exactly
once, here, and are taken verbatim from the als-ontology prototype's
``neo4j/init/01-init-constraints.cypher``.  Bootstrap diffs a store's live
config against :data:`N10S_GRAPH_CONFIG` rather than silently skipping
``graphconfig.init``, so a store initialized under older settings is reported
instead of quietly serving a graph shaped differently from what the queries
assume.

#:   ``narad_p:sPositionM`` rather than a mangled URI.
#: * ``handleMultival='ARRAY'`` restricted by ``multivalPropList`` to
#:   ``skos:altLabel`` — the one predicate in the NARAD vocabulary that
#:   genuinely repeats, since an ontology class carries a handful of synonyms
#:   ("bend", "bending magnet", "dipole").  Those land as a Cypher list the
#:   synonym lookups can search element by element.  The prop list is what keeps
#:   the rest of the graph scalar (``.sectionCode = 'GTL'``, not ``['GTL']``):
#:   ARRAY on its own would wrap *every* property in a list and rewrite every
#:   query.
#: * ``keepLangTag=False`` — the ALS data carries no language tags.
#: * ``handleRDFTypes='LABELS_AND_NODES'`` — every ``rdf:type`` becomes both a
#:   ``:Resource`` label and a typed node, which is what the class-hierarchy
#:   rollup queries traverse.
