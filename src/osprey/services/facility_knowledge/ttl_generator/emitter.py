"""Turtle serialisation of the generated demo-machine knowledge graph.

Turns a :class:`~osprey.services.facility_knowledge.ttl_generator.model.GraphModel`
plus an :class:`~osprey.services.facility_knowledge.ttl_generator.ontology_map.OntologyMap`
into a NARAD-convention Turtle file that ``osprey knowledge seed-graph`` can
import into the graph store.

The output follows the NARAD convention triple-for-triple in *shape* — the
convention the als-ontology project defines, which is what the graph tools'
Cypher is written against: the same prefixes, the same predicate spellings,
devices carrying the identity and position
properties, ``narad_sem:ChannelBinding`` nodes carrying ``bindingId`` /
``confidence`` / ``fullPv`` / ``protocol`` and one of
``narad_p:readsSignal`` / ``narad_p:writesSignal``, ``narad_sem:SemanticSignal``
individuals, and an ``owl:Class`` hierarchy joined by ``rdfs:subClassOf``.

**System.** Every device also carries ``narad_p:system`` — the raw system
token of its address (``MAG``, ``DIAG``, ``VAC``).  It is the coarsest grouping
the address grammar offers, so a question like "how many vacuum devices are
there" is one property filter rather than a family-by-family enumeration.  It is
the token itself, not the prose: ``narad_p:systemDescription`` carries the text.

**Facility.** ``narad_p:facility`` is read off ``GraphModel.facility`` — the
token the model's identifiers were minted with.  This module keeps no facility
constant of its own, so the literal and the IRIs beside it cannot disagree.

**Extra properties.** A device or binding may carry the facility's own scalar
properties (``extra_properties`` on either node).  They are emitted after the
node's fixed triples, in sorted key order, as ``narad_p:`` literals chosen from
the Python type, and their names join :data:`PROPERTY_NAMES` in the vocabulary
block through :func:`declared_property_names`.  A node without them emits
exactly the bytes it did before extras existed.

**Prose.** When the model carries description text, bindings also get
``narad_p:description`` / ``fieldDescription`` / ``subfieldDescription`` and
devices get ``familyDescription`` / ``systemDescription`` / ``ringDescription``.
Each is a distinct predicate carrying at most one value per node — neosemantics
collapses repeated values of one predicate, so two texts under one name would
lose data on import.  ``narad_sem:SemanticSignal`` carries no description text
by design: a signal is keyed ``(FAMILY, FIELD, SUBFIELD)`` without a ring, while
the prose is ring-qualified, so only the binding's six-token address resolves it
unambiguously.  Description fields left ``None`` emit nothing at all.

Those are the *Turtle-side* spellings.  neosemantics maps them to uppercase
relationship types (``HASBINDING``, ``READSSIGNAL``, …) when it imports the
file; those uppercase names belong to the Cypher projection only and must never
appear here.

**Determinism.** The same model always serialises to the same bytes.  Nothing is
left to a library's iteration order: the triples are assembled in an explicit
order, subjects are emitted in that order, predicates are sorted by IRI with
``rdf:type`` pinned first, and multiple objects of one predicate are sorted by
their lexical value.  That matters because the seed marker in the graph store is
a checksum over the Turtle text, so unstable output would make every deploy look
like a corpus change.

**Lazy rdflib.** ``rdflib`` is imported inside the functions that need it, never
at module top level — :func:`serialize_turtle` and :func:`write_turtle` do not
need it at all.  ``tests/services/facility_knowledge/test_import_isolation.py``
guards the discipline for the whole package.

    **Direction provenance.**  ``build-ttl`` knows which rule produced the

    between them.  A deployment emitting through the library API therefore
