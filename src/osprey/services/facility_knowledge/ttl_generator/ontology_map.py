"""FAMILY-to-class table and class hierarchy for the generated knowledge graph.

The channel database says a device belongs to the ``DIPOLE`` family; the graph
store needs it typed as ``narad_sem:Dipole``, and needs to know that a Dipole is
a Magnet and a Magnet is an AcceleratorDevice.  This module holds that table.

The table itself is data, not code: :data:`DEMO_ONTOLOGY_FILENAME` ships next to
this module and :func:`load_demo_ontology` reads it.  The shipped
``demo_ontology.json`` is compiled from ``demo_ontology.yaml``, a LinkML schema
in this same directory, by ``osprey knowledge compile-ontology``, and must not
be edited by hand.  A facility with its own vocabulary points
:func:`load_ontology`'s ``--ontology`` at its own compiled or hand-written JSON
table instead of editing the generator.

The demo table copies its class hierarchy edge-for-edge from the NARAD
shared-semantics vocabulary the als-ontology project defines, so a query that
rolls devices up to ``narad_sem:Magnet`` on any NARAD graph rolls the analogous
devices up on the demo graph.  The file's own ``_comment`` block records where
the demo machine has no exact NARAD class and which nearest class stands in.

This module is **pure**: no ``rdflib``, no ``neo4j`` — the contract
``test_import_isolation.py`` enforces.  It reads one JSON file and nothing else.
