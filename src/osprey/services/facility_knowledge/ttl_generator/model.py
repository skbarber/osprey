"""Pure data model for the demo-machine knowledge graph.

Turns the expanded channel map of the control_assistant hierarchical channel
database into the three node populations a NARAD-convention Turtle file needs:

* :class:`Device` — one per ``(RING, SYSTEM, FAMILY, DEVICE)`` tuple.
* :class:`ChannelBinding` — one per channel address.
* :class:`SignalGroup` — one per ``(FAMILY, FIELD, SUBFIELD)`` combination; the
  ``narad_sem:SemanticSignal`` individuals the bindings point at.

This module is **pure**: standard library plus the (stdlib-only) seeder package,
for its NARAD prefix table — no ``rdflib``, no filesystem access, no
configuration lookups.  (Validating an extra property reads the emitter's list
of built-in property names, lazily, because that list is the Turtle side's to
own; the emitter is stdlib-only too.)  Serialisation and the read/write
direction of each signal group are decided elsewhere;
:attr:`SignalGroup.direction` is the slot a later pass fills in (see
:meth:`GraphModel.with_directions`).

Everything is deterministic.  The same channel map always produces the same
model regardless of dict insertion order, because every collection is sorted by
an explicit key.  That matters downstream: the seed marker in the graph store
is a checksum over the generated Turtle text, so unstable ordering would make
every deploy look like a corpus change.

The address grammar is the six-token colon form used by the demo machine::

    RING:SYSTEM:FAMILY:DEVICE:FIELD:SUBFIELD
    SR:MAG:DIPOLE:01:CURRENT:SP
    SR:VAC:GAUGE:SR01:PRESSURE:RB

    One group is minted per ``(FAMILY, FIELD, SUBFIELD)`` combination, so every

    and assert it holds for all members.

    A group carries no prose by design.  The hierarchical tree's field and
    subfield text is ring-qualified, and a group's key has no ring in it — the
    same ``(FAMILY, FIELD, SUBFIELD)`` in two rings would offer two texts.  The
    prose therefore hangs off :class:`ChannelBinding`, whose address resolves
    every text exactly.

    Prose is optional and purely additive: with both description arguments left

    the keys alone describe.  When prose is supplied it is attached by **exact
    join** — an address or path the caller has no text for keeps ``None``
    rather than borrowing a neighbour's.

    Args:
        channel_map: The expanded map from
            :class:`~osprey.services.channel_finder.databases.hierarchical.HierarchicalChannelDatabase`.
            Only the **keys** are read — they are the colon-grammar addresses —

        facility: Facility token to mint every IRI and identifier with, and the
            token the returned model carries.  Defaults to :data:`FACILITY`, so
            the shipped demo corpus is unchanged.  Two models with different
            tokens can be built in one process: nothing is stored globally.
        hierarchy_descriptions: Prose from the hierarchical tree, as returned by
            :func:`resolve_hierarchy_descriptions`.  Its ring, system and family
            maps land on :class:`Device`; its field and subfield maps land on
            :class:`ChannelBinding`, which is the only node whose key carries
            the ring the text is qualified by.
        binding_descriptions: Per-channel prose keyed by full six-token address,
            for :attr:`ChannelBinding.description`.
        device_properties: The facility's own scalar properties per device,
            keyed by the four-token device address (``SR:MAG:DIPOLE:01``).  Each
            value is a mapping of property name to ``str`` / ``int`` / ``float``,
            normalised into :attr:`Device.extra_properties`.  The join is exact,
            as the prose joins are: a device the caller has no values for keeps
            an empty carrier, and a key naming no device reaches nothing.
        binding_properties: The same, per channel, keyed by full six-token
            address, for :attr:`ChannelBinding.extra_properties`.

    Returns:
        The derived :class:`GraphModel`.
