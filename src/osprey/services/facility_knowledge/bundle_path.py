"""Single resolution rule for ``facility_knowledge.bundle_path``.

Three consumers read that one config key — the ``osprey_facility_knowledge``
MCP server, the ``osprey knowledge`` CLI, and the OKF knowledge panel — and
they must land on the same directory or a valid relative value silently means
different bundles in different places. :func:`resolve_bundle_path` is that one
rule for this key: it delegates to
:func:`osprey.utils.config_paths.resolve_config_relative_path`, the framework's
rule for every config-relative path — expand ``~``, then resolve a
still-relative value against the project root (the repo, not its ``build/``
render), which is what the config template and
``how-to/facility-knowledge/okf-bundle.rst`` promise and what the compose
layer binds into every container.
