"""Prepares a validated session-tier plan for contribution to a permanent catalog.

This module is thin glue, not a contribution engine: it never opens a pull/merge
request, never commits, and never touches ``plan_loader.py``'s directory
layers or trust order. All it does is (1) refuse to hand off a session plan
whose *current* on-disk content lacks a passing validation record — the same
check the load gate and the launch gate perform — and (2)
copy that plan's exact bytes into a checkout of the repo that owns the target
``preset``/``facility`` plan directory, so the file is ready to ``git add``.

**The contribution workflow this glue supports:**

1. Author + validate a session plan (``write_plan`` / ``validate_plan``),
   then run it a few times via ``launch_run`` until it looks worth keeping.
2. Call :func:`prepare_contribution` with the plan's ``name`` and a filesystem
   path to a checkout of the repo that owns the target catalog directory —
   one of the directories already listed in ``bluesky.plan_dirs`` (config.yml,
   ``preset`` tier) or ``BLUESKY_PLAN_DIRS`` (env, ``facility`` tier); see
   ``plan_loader.py``'s module docstring for the tier mapping. This raises
   unless the plan has a passing validation record for its exact current
   content.
3. Call :func:`stage_contribution` on the result to write the file into that
   checkout.
4. Use the existing **``osprey-contribute``** skill (branch → commit → push
   → PR, GitHub Flow) to open the PR/MR proposing the addition — exactly as
   for any other change to that repo. This module supplies the file and a
   suggested branch name / PR title / PR body; it does not re-implement any
   part of that workflow.

**The trust boundary — read this before wiring anything to auto-contribute:**
Nothing in this module (or step 1-3 above) raises the plan's provenance.
A staged file sitting in a target repo's working tree, or even a pushed
branch with an open PR, is still exactly as trusted as it was in the
session: unreviewed. Provenance rises from ``session`` to ``preset``/
``facility`` **only** at the moment a human reviews and merges that PR/MR
into the branch the deployment actually serves plans from. The merge is the
trust boundary — not this module, not validation, not the PR being open.
