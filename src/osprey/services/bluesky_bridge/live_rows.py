"""Bounded live-row buffer for run data still in flight or just completed.

The ``GET /runs/{id}/data`` route needs a source of truth for run data before
(or in place of) a Tiled server. Scans run in the queueserver worker, which
publishes its document stream over 0MQ; the bridge's document plane
(``document_plane.py``) subscribes to that stream and feeds the plain-dict
callback below, which keeps translated rows in a bounded buffer. This module is
deliberately import-clean of bluesky, so it can be unit-tested with synthetic
documents and no worker at all. Generalizes the concept in BELLA's
``services/experiment_config/live_rows.py``: this version has no
GEECS-specific legacy column mapping, and explicitly RETAINS completed runs
rather than evicting at a small run count, so a read arriving after the plan
finishes still succeeds without a Tiled server.

Document handling (bluesky's plain-dict document protocol):

- ``start``: begins a new buffer for ``doc["uid"]`` — or for the recorder's
  explicit ``key``, when the caller keys buffers by something other than the
  RunEngine's own uid (see :class:`LiveRowRecorder`) — marked partial, and
  stamped with the recorder's opaque ``plan`` value if it was given one.
- ``event``: each event's ``doc["data"]`` becomes one row; columns are
  discovered incrementally in first-seen order across events. A key seen for
  the first time extends the column list and backfills every already-stored
  row with ``None`` in that column, so all stored rows stay aligned to the
  current column list; a later event missing an already-known column simply
  records ``None`` for it.
- ``stop``: flips ``partial`` to ``False``. This is the ONLY thing that ends
  the "still filling in" state — a buffer that never gets a stop doc (e.g.
  the process crashed mid-run) stays partial forever, which is the honest
  answer.

Bounding uses two independent knobs:

- ``_MAX_ROWS_PER_RUN``: a hard cap on stored rows per run, so a runaway plan
  cannot grow the buffer without limit. ``total_seen`` keeps counting every
  event past this cap — the ``row_count`` on the run-data route reports this
  *true* total
  even when the tail beyond the cap was never stored (a documented trade-off
  for a pathological never-ending run, not the common case).
- ``_MAX_RUNS``: number of run buffers retained at all, oldest-evicted
  (insertion-ordered ``OrderedDict``, ``move_to_end`` on every write) once
  exceeded. This is what lets a completed run's data survive to be read
  later — unlike BELLA's demo-day ``_MAX_RUNS = 4``, Phase 2 sets this much
  higher since there is no Tiled fallback yet.

The recorder itself never raises: every document is handled inside a
try/except so a recorder bug can never abort a run (mirrors the runner
seam's own safety contract) — a bug here loses live-read fidelity for that
run, not the run itself.

    One instance per run (mirrors BELLA's contract): it must see the run's

    through the stream.

    Args:
        key: Buffer key to record under, instead of the start document's own
            ``uid``. The document plane (``document_plane.py``) sets it to the
            OSPREY run id carried in the start document, because a run executed
            in the queueserver container has a RunEngine uid the bridge never
            chose and cannot map back to the item an operator enqueued. Left
            ``None``, the run uid IS the identity the read path looks up —
            which is the honest key for a run that carries no OSPREY id.
        plan: Which plan produced this run, carried alongside its rows so a
            reader that has only a run id can tell what the columns mean. The
            value is opaque here: this module stores it and hands it back in
            :func:`get`, and never interprets, validates, or copies it. The
            document plane extracts it from the start document (mirroring
            ``key``), which keeps this module testable with synthetic
            documents. ``None`` for a run whose start document carried no plan
            stamp — an honest "not known", never a placeholder.
