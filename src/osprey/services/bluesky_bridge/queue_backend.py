"""Stateless adapter over bluesky-queueserver's RE manager.

The bridge is the sole facade in front of the queue server: panels, MCP tools,
and the agent never see a qserver API. This module is the one place that speaks
it. Everything here is a thin, typed translation of
``bluesky-queueserver-api``'s ``REManagerAPI`` — the manager (and the Redis it
persists to) is the single source of truth for queue and history, so this class
deliberately caches nothing about them. The only state it owns is the client
handle, the resolved connector type, and the environment-lifecycle policy.

Two responsibilities beyond pass-through:

**Environment ownership.** Queueserver's worker environment is opened and closed
by the bridge and nobody else — it is never exposed to panels or MCP. The bridge
opens it at startup (with bounded retry; connecting devices can take tens of
seconds) when the resolved ``control_system.type`` is EPICS-like, and never on a
mock deployment, where a closed environment is the correct, healthy steady
state. :meth:`QueueBackend.ensure_environment` is both the startup call and the
re-open path when something else closed the environment underneath a deployment
that is supposed to be able to execute.

**Capability derivation.** :meth:`QueueBackend.capability` answers "can plans
actually execute in this deployment, and if not, why not" as a machine-readable
record. It is fail-closed in every direction: an unreadable project config, an
unconfigured manager, and an unreachable manager all yield
``can_execute: False`` with distinct reason codes, so no deployment can ever
advertise an execution ability it does not have.

**Emergency abort.** :meth:`QueueBackend.abort` is the one place where this
module composes several manager calls into a single operator-facing operation,
because upstream's Run Engine will not abort a plan that is still running — it
must be paused first. Everything that composition needs to get right (which
pause option, how long to wait, what "already paused" and "it finished while we
were pausing" mean) is stated in that method's docstring.

All failures leave this module as one of the :class:`QueueBackendError`
subclasses below, each carrying a stable ``reason`` code; the route layer maps
the type to an HTTP status and puts the code on the wire.

    async def abort(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Abort the plan that is running RIGHT NOW, leaving the queue stopped.

        This is the emergency halt, and the only operation in this module that
        composes several manager calls. Upstream will not abort a plan that is
        still running: ``re_abort`` (like ``re_stop``/``re_halt``) acts only on
        a Run Engine that is already **paused**, so the sequence is

        1. ``status(reload=True)`` — fresh, never the client's ~0.5 s cache. The
           whole decision below turns on the manager's live state, and acting on
           a half-second-old read is exactly the class of bug that makes a halt
           lie.
        2. If the Run Engine is already paused, skip straight to step 4 (a human
           may have paused it from qserver's own console).
        3. Otherwise, if the queue is active, ``re_pause(option="immediate")``
           and then poll ``status(reload=True)`` every ``abort_poll_interval``
           for up to ``abort_pause_polls`` polls, re-issuing the pause on each
           poll that still shows an active-but-unpaused manager. Re-issuing
           covers the ``starting_queue`` window, where the first pause is
           refused because the plan has not begun yet; an immediate pause that
           already landed is not re-applied, because the loop exits the moment
           the state reads ``paused``.
        4. ``re_abort`` — the plan's remaining points are discarded and the
           queue is left stopped.
        5. One final ``status(reload=True)`` purely to report the state. A
           failure here is swallowed: the abort has already been accepted, and
           turning a reporting failure into a 503 would tell the operator the
           machine did not stop when it did.

        Not active at all (idle, or an environment-lifecycle state) raises
        :class:`NothingRunningError` rather than issuing anything — an honest
        "there is nothing to stop", not a failure. If the plan ENDS while the
        pause is being chased, the poll sees ``idle`` and raises the same error,
        which is again the truth: nothing is running now.

        Returns:
            ``{"aborted": True, "abort_pending", "paused_first", "manager_state",
            "msg"}``. ``abort_pending`` is True when the manager had not yet
            settled out of an active state at the moment of the final read — the
            abort is accepted and unwinding, not finished. ``msg`` is the
            manager's own sentence, relayed rather than rewritten.

        Raises:
            NothingRunningError: No plan was under way (409 at the route layer).
            AbortPauseTimeoutError: The Run Engine never paused, so nothing was
                aborted and the plan may still be running.
            QueueUnavailableError: The manager stopped answering.
            QueueRequestRejectedError: The manager reached the paused state but
                refused the abort itself.

        Submitted with ``run_in_background=True``, which is what makes the call

        Which functions may be called at all is the manager's permissions to
        decide, not this module's — an unpermitted name is refused by the
