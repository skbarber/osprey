"""Run records, projected from the queue server's own item state.

The bridge does not execute plans — the queueserver worker does (see
``qserver_startup.py``). A run is therefore not an object this process owns and
mutates through a lifecycle; it is a *view* over three things the manager
already holds: the pending queue, the running item, and the history. Each is
keyed back to OSPREY by the run id the enqueue path stamps into the item's
metadata (``queue_backend.RUN_ID_META_KEY``), which is also the key the
document plane buffers live rows under — so one id joins the queue, the live
data, and the durable Tiled record.

This module is the projection alone. It takes already-fetched manager
documents and returns the record shape ``GET /runs`` and ``GET /runs/{id}``
publish; it opens no connections and raises no ``HTTPException``. Keeping the
I/O in the route layer is what makes every status-mapping decision below
testable against a literal manager document, with no manager and no app.

Items the manager holds that carry no OSPREY run id are deliberately absent
from these records: something enqueued out-of-band (a ``qserver`` CLI, another
client) has no id for ``GET /runs/{id}`` to answer on, and inventing one would
make two id spaces look like one. ``GET /queue`` is the complete view of what
the manager is holding, and shows those items unfiltered.

    pushes a COPY back to the FRONT of the queue under a NEW ``item_uid``, so
    the operator can decide whether to run it again. That copy keeps the
    ``result`` block, and it keeps the same OSPREY run id.

    That matters here because `_ordered_records` walks the queue BEFORE history
    and emits each run id once: without this, the requeued copy SHADOWS the
    correct history record, and a plan a human just emergency-aborted is
    published as ``pending`` — as work that has not happened yet — while

    ``stopped``, failed → ``error``, anything unrecognized → ``error``,
