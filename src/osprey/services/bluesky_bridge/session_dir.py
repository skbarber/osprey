"""Resolves the bridge-owned, writable session-plan directory.

An authored (session-tier) plan file is the one thing the bridge itself
writes, rather than merely discovers — every directory layer
``plan_loader.py`` otherwise scans (``shipped``/``preset``/``facility``) is
operator-supplied and read-only from the bridge's point of view. This module
is the single place that resolves *where* an authored plan file lives, so
both the write path (``POST /plans/session``) and the discovery path
(``plan_loader.py``'s session-tier directory layer) agree on the same
directory without either hardcoding it.

Ephemeral by design, like the run registry (``runs.py``) and the validation
record store (``validation_record.py``): the default directory has no deploy
volume behind it, so a container rebuild/restart loses every session plan
along with the (equally in-memory) validation records that referenced them —
consistent with the bridge's existing "stateless except explicit, documented
exceptions" posture. A deploy that wants session plans to survive a restart
sets ``BLUESKY_SESSION_PLAN_DIR`` to a mounted, writable path.
