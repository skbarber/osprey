"""Shipped plan: ``orm``, an orbit-response-matrix sweep.

Discovered via the layered directory catalog's ``shipped`` tier (a folder
scan of this package's ``plans_core/`` dir — see ``plan_loader.py``): kick
each corrector channel, one at a time, either side of the working point it
was already holding, reading every BPM channel at each point, then put it
back.

Device-agnostic: ``correctors``/``readbacks`` are resolved by string name against
whatever ``devices`` dict the bridge passes in; nothing here names a facility
PV or a fixed device set. Both fields declare their channel role, so every
consumer — the load gate, the enqueue pre-check, the dry run, the pre-flight
trajectory — reads what this plan drives and what it reads rather than
guessing it from a field name.

This plan opens its own run, so it stamps its own run metadata through
``scan_metadata()``: the channels it moves and reads, and the total point
count (one point per corrector per swept current). No dimensionality hint —
the sweeps are serial and per-corrector, not one continuous traversal, so
there is no truthful value for one.

    corrector's hysteresis/offset); ``monodirectional`` spans ``[0, span_a]``

    """Build the orbit-response-matrix sweep generator.

    For each corrector in turn: read where it is already sitting, sweep it
    over ``num`` kicks evenly spaced across the range ``sweep`` selects —
    ``[-span_a, +span_a]`` (bidirectional) or ``[0, +span_a]``
    (monodirectional) — and put it back. Each kick is applied *relative to
    that corrector's own pre-scan working point*, and at each point the plan
    ``trigger_and_read``-s every corrector together with every BPM channel
    in one bundle, so each point emits exactly one event carrying the driven
    corrector's current alongside every BPM reading.

    **Relative, because a machine with beam in it is not at zero.** A ring
    running corrected orbit holds every corrector at a nonzero
    orbit-correction working point. Sweeping absolute currents about zero
    would measure the response about a point the machine is not at, and
    "restoring" to a literal 0 A would drop the entire correction the ring
    was holding — on a stored beam, that is the orbit gone. Reading each
    corrector's working point costs one extra read per corrector and makes
    the plan mean the same thing on a real ring as on a virtual accelerator
    whose correctors happen to idle at zero.

    The read is `bps.rd`, so the working point is the corrector's own
    readback — which is the right value to restore under this bridge's
    device contract, where a settable's ``set()`` does not complete until
    the readback agrees with the demand (see ``devices/connector.py``'s
    ``ConnectorSettable``). It happens BEFORE the ``try``, so a corrector
    whose read fails is never entered at all and the restore below can never
    run without a target.

    Each corrector is restored to its recorded working point once its own
    sweep finishes, including on abort (the ``try``/``finally`` runs on
    ``GeneratorExit`` too) — a restore failure is caught and logged rather
    than allowed to replace an in-flight sweep exception.

    The run this opens is stamped with ``scan_metadata()``: the correctors it
    moves, the BPMs it reads, and ``num`` points per corrector across every
    corrector. Sweeps are serial and per-corrector rather than one continuous
    traversal, so no dimensionality hint is declared.

    Raises:
        ValueError: A corrector read back a non-finite working point. Every
            setpoint derived from it would be non-finite too, and a NaN
            demand is not something a limits check can refuse (``nan <
            low`` and ``nan > high`` are both false), so it would reach the
            IOC and only then fail as a readback-settle timeout. Refusing
            here means no write is attempted at all.

def render(window: RowWindow, params: PARAMS) -> Figure:
    """The `orm` plan's own view of a run: sweep traces, then the fitted matrix.

    Panel order is stable, so a live figure grows rather than rearranging:

    1. One **sweep trace** panel per corrector that has recorded a point --
       every BPM reading against that corrector's own current. These always
       appear, for a `monodirectional` sweep as readily as a `bidirectional`
       one and for a run three points in as readily as a finished one.
    2. Once at least one corrector's sweep has completed, the **response
       matrix** heatmap (BPMs against correctors, labelled with the real device
       names), then the **corrector** and **BPM anomaly score** bars from
       `orm_analysis`'s peer-structure detectors.

    Rows are attributed to correctors by acquisition index -- corrector ``j``'s
    samples are ``rows[j * num : (j + 1) * num]``, which is what this plan's
    `build_plan` emits -- so the caller owes emission order with nothing dropped
    from the front. ``window.rows_complete`` is what says whether that holds:
    ``False`` means the rows are a prefix of the run (the bridge's live buffer
    hit its per-run cap; no figure source ever hands this plan a middle or a
    tail). There the traces still stand -- a prefix keeps each corrector's
    slice where it belongs, and each trace is a claim about individual rows --
    but the matrix and anomaly panels are suppressed, because a peer-comparison
    score computed over whichever correctors fit is a statement about the cut,
    not about the machine. An annotation on the first panel says so, quoting
    ``window.total_seen`` for how much of the run went undrawn.

    **Never raises.** A figure is a view, not a result: any internal failure
    degrades to the traces alone, and a failure in those to a figure with no
    panels, so the route always has something to serve.

    **`partial` and `source` are placeholders the route overwrites.** This
    function sees rows, not their provenance, so it returns ``partial=True,
    source="live"`` unconditionally and the figure route stamps the truth onto
    both on every path. ``True`` is the honest direction for the placeholder: a
    forgotten overwrite costs a client extra polling, never a false "settled".

    Args:
        window: The run's event `data` dicts in emission order, and whether
            they are all of them (`RowWindow`).
        params: The parameters the run was launched with.

    Returns:
        A `Figure` whose panels are as complete as the rows allow.
