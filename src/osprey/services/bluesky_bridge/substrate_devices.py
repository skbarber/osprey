"""Canonical derivation of the bluesky bridge's EPICS-substrate plan devices.

Single source of truth for turning a *built project's own*
``data/channel_limits.json`` into the bridge's EPICS-substrate device set
(``BLUESKY_EPICS_SUBSTRATE`` / ``BLUESKY_EPICS_SETPOINTS`` / ``_READBACKS`` — see
``osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.devices._specs_from_env`` for the format
those env vars carry). Correctors are restricted to the pyat-coupled SR
HCM/VCM ``:SP``/``:RB`` partition (a write actually steers the beam via the
AT lattice model); BPMs are the pyat-coupled SR ``DIAG:BPM`` readbacks. Never
a hardcoded preset channel — always derived from the deployed project's own
data.

Device name == channel address
------------------------------

Each device is keyed by the address it drives or reads -- a corrector by its
``:SP`` address, a BPM by its read address -- not by a synthetic
``corrector_01``/``bpm_01`` label. This is deliberate: channel-finder output
IS the worker namespace. The addresses an agent discovers are exactly the
names a plan may reference, so there is no second, agent-invisible namespace
to translate through and no discovery surface that has to be kept in sync
with this derivation.

The conscious trade-off is in queueserver's device-permission patterns
(``user_group_permissions.yaml``'s ``allowed_devices``/``forbidden_devices``).
``:`` is that mini-language's own component separator and is not escapable,
so an address cannot be written *literally* in a rule. A rule may still
target exactly one address-named device, but only by wildcarding each colon
--- ``:?^SR.MAG.HCM.01.CURRENT.SP$:depth=1`` selects that one device, since
``.`` matches ``:`` --- or by falling back to a catch-all like
``:?.*:depth=5``, which is what this project ships.

Beware the fail-open trap when writing such a rule: a pattern that attempts
a literal (or backslash-escaped) colon address raises inside
``load_allowed_plans_and_devices``, which catches every exception and falls
back to the *unfiltered* device set -- so an operator reaching for a tighter
rule can silently end up with allow-everything.

That is accepted rather than worked around: as ``user_group_permissions.
yaml``'s own header states, the permission layer is not the safety boundary
and must not be mistaken for one. Every write a plan performs still passes
the connector's per-put reference monitor and the bridge's arming + limits
facade, which are the boundary.

Deploy caveat: ``container_lifecycle._ensure_bluesky_substrate_env`` never
overwrites an already-set value, so a project keeps whatever
``BLUESKY_EPICS_SETPOINTS``/``_READBACKS`` its ``.env`` already holds until those
lines are removed. Fresh deploys get the address names automatically.

Two consumers share this module (DRY, one derivation):

- ``osprey.deployment.container_lifecycle`` (``_ensure_bluesky_substrate_env``),
  which auto-configures a VA-backed Bluesky stack's ``.env`` on ``osprey up``
  so the bridge starts in substrate mode with real channel names,
  turn-key.
- ``tests/e2e/_orm_stack.py``, whose ``select_correctors``/``select_bpms``/
  ``write_substrate_env`` delegate here instead of re-deriving the same logic.

Host/deploy-side only — NOT part of the bridge's own container import
surface. This module imports ``osprey.services.virtual_accelerator.manifest``
(``classify_partition``/``PARTITION_PYAT_COUPLED``) -- the same
virtual-accelerator/channel-finder coupling ``_specs_from_env``'s module
docstring says the bridge's substrate branch must never take on directly
(the bridge is meant to stay control-system agnostic; the PV list reaches it
only via ``BLUESKY_EPICS_SETPOINTS``/``_READBACKS``). Nothing under
``osprey.services.bluesky_bridge`` that runs *inside* the bridge container
(``app.py``, ``devices/*``) may import this module — it lives alongside the
bridge's device code only because it is conceptually about the bridge's
devices, not because it shares the bridge's runtime import surface. It runs
only from the host-side deploy/CLI process and from tests.
