"""The bridge's half of the document plane: a 0MQ proxy feeding the live-row buffer.

No plan runs inside this process. The RunEngine lives in the
``queueserver`` container (``qserver_startup.py``), which subscribes a
``bluesky.callbacks.zmq`` ``Publisher`` to it; this module runs the other end —
the ``Proxy`` that Publisher connects to, plus a ``RemoteDispatcher`` that
turns the republished stream back into rows in the existing ``live_rows``
buffer. That is how ``GET /runs/{id}/data`` keeps serving live data for a plan
the bridge is not executing.

**The proxy is the binding element.** The bridge binds both sockets and the
worker connects to the in-side, which is what makes key authentication
possible in the first place: the queueserver container is necessarily
dual-homed (it needs the accelerator network for Channel Access and Tiled), so
network placement alone protects nothing. CurveZMQ ``ServerCurve`` on the
in-side, with a pinned directory of accepted client public keys, is the only
thing standing between this socket and a rogue container injecting forged run
documents. Consequently, a configured-but-unauthenticatable document plane
does NOT fall back to an unencrypted socket — it does not come up at all, and
the bridge degrades to "no live rows" (Tiled still serves completed runs).

**Buffers are keyed by OSPREY's run id, not the RunEngine's uid.** The run uid
is chosen inside the worker; the bridge never sees it before the fact and
cannot map it back to the queue item an operator enqueued. The enqueue path
threads OSPREY's own run id through queueserver item metadata
(``queue_backend.RUN_ID_META_KEY``), queueserver merges that metadata into the
run's start document, and :class:`RunDocumentRouter` reads it back out there.
A start document without it (someone drove the worker directly) falls back to
the run uid, so such a run is still recorded — just under the only identity it
has. The same metadata path carries the plan stamp
(``queue_backend.PLAN_META_KEY``), read out here and handed to the recorder so
a run's rows stay self-describing for a reader holding only its id. Because a
run id can be reused — re-running an interrupted item keeps it — a start
document also invalidates any settled figure cached under that id
(``figure_cache.evict``), which is what lets the figure route trust its cache
without re-reading the source to check.

**Progress is computed here, not in the worker.** ``rows_seen`` comes from the
live buffer's true event count; the denominator is the point count the run
declares in its own metadata, read off its start document as that document
lands. A run that declares nothing has no denominator: the progress record
reports ``rows_seen`` with a ``None`` fraction — an honest "still going, total
unknown" rather than a fabricated one.

Nothing is inferred from the parameters an item was enqueued with, so an item
that is queued but has not started yet has no denominator at all. That gap is
the deliberate price of the contract: inferring a count from parameter shapes
meant deciding what a plan *does* from what its fields are *called*, which is
right until a plan names a field the way the rules did not expect and the
operator watches a confidently wrong progress bar. The run is the only party
that knows its own extent, so the run declares it and this plane reports what
was declared.
