"""The Bluesky bridge's write-safety validation gates — the whole set, isolated.

This module holds every gate that stands between a launch request and real
hardware motion, deliberately gathered in one small, reviewable place. Nothing
here builds a runner, touches a connector, or mutates process state; each
function only *reads* config/disk and either returns cleanly or raises. Keep it
that way — a reviewer must be able to audit the bridge's entire write-safety
posture by reading this one file.

Two independent gates, each defense-in-depth against a different failure:

- :func:`_assert_limits_readable_if_writable` — a STARTUP guard. Refuses to
  bring the bridge up in the one unsafe posture: writes enabled for the
  target THIS LANE serves + limits checking enabled for that same target +
  the limits database unreadable. Fail-OPEN by design (see its docstring):
  every other combination starts normally.
- :func:`_validate_launchable_request` — a per-ENQUEUE gate. Refuses to enqueue
  a session/unreviewed plan whose CURRENT on-disk content has no passing
  validation record, re-reading and re-hashing the file at enqueue time rather
  than trusting any earlier snapshot.

Neither gate is a containment boundary on its own — the plan validator has a
documented, accepted obfuscation residual (see ``plan_validation.py``), and the
real backstop for a malicious plan body is human approval at launch (the MCP
PreToolUse prompt) plus the launch token that arms the queue. These gates keep
the *honest* mistakes and stale-record races out; do not weaken either, and do
not let the enqueue gate's freshness (re-read + re-hash every time) regress
into a cached lookup.

    """Refuse startup if writes are enabled but the limits database can't be read.

    The posture checked is THIS LANE's, not the deployment's: a bridge
    container serves one lane, that lane serves one control target
    (`queue_backend.resolve_lane_identity`), and the write posture of that
    target is what this process could actually move. Reading the
    deployment-wide ``control_system.writes_enabled`` instead would refuse
    startup for a read-only virtual-accelerator lane because some *other*
    lane's machine is armed, and — the direction that matters — would start a
    lane whose own connector block arms writes while the global key says
    false. So the condition is
    ``control_system.connector.<type>.writes_enabled`` for the type this
    lane's target resolves to (inheriting the deployment-wide key where the
    block says nothing), ANDed with ``not is_readonly_run()`` so a read-only
    run needs no limits database at all.

    That whole condition is asked through
    :func:`osprey_connectors.session_store.effective_writes`, the one rule the
    connector's reference monitor and the MCP queue surface also read, so the
    bridge and the tool addressing it cannot disagree about whether this lane
    can write. It adds a third term to the two above: the operator's
    per-(session, target) narrowing from the header chip, which can only
    narrow. In practice a bridge CONTAINER carries no
    ``OSPREY_POSTURE_SESSION`` stamp — a container is not spawned from a
    session — so the term is inert there and this guard behaves exactly as it
    always has; it bites only where the bridge runs under a stamped session,
    and it bites in the fail-open direction, which is the same direction
    "writes disabled" already takes. Note that this is a STARTUP guard reading
    a store that moves at run time: a narrowing lifted after start is not
    re-checked here. That is deliberate and costs nothing, because the gate
    that stands between a plan and hardware is the per-write one, not this.

    Limits checking is resolved the same way, and for the same reason: a
    deployment may leave its virtual accelerator unchecked while its live
    machine enforces limits, so the condition is
    ``control_system.connector.<type>.limits_checking.enabled`` for this
    lane's type, inheriting the deployment-wide block where no per-type block
    says anything. Only ``database_path`` stays deployment-wide — the
    deployment mounts one limits database, and a per-type block that omits the
    path is complete rather than incomplete.

    Fail-OPEN by design: this is the ONLY combination that refuses
    startup — this lane's write posture AND this lane's limits posture both
    true, AND the limits database is missing, unreadable, or unparseable.
    Every other combination starts normally: writes disabled (read-only
    posture) never even probes the database; writes enabled with limits
    checking disabled needs no database at all; writes enabled with a readable
    database is the healthy case. A writable deploy with no working limits enforcement is the one
    unsafe posture this guard exists to catch before any connector/CA work
    begins.

    Mirrors `LimitsValidator.from_config`'s ``database_path`` resolution
    (a relative path anchors on the directory of the config actually loaded,
    falling back to the ``CONFIG_FILE`` env var's directory and then
    ``project_root`` — container-correct, since the deploy flattens
    ``project_root`` in as the HOST build path while the loaded config is the
    one mounted in-container), but probes readability via
    `LimitsValidator._load_limits_database`
    directly rather than calling `from_config` — `from_config` swallows every
    load failure to `None`, which would hide the exact failure this guard
    must detect and raise on.

    No project config context at all (e.g. running outside a configured
    OSPREY project — most unit-test environments) is treated the same way
    `LimitsValidator.from_config` treats it: nothing to probe, so this
    returns without blocking startup, rather than raising on the config
    lookup itself.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: naming the lane, its target, and which condition failed
            (both resolved posture keys, so an operator is sent to the lines
            that actually answered rather than to a deployment-wide one some
            per-type block overrides, whether the posture could be read at
            all — a leaf missing from a per-type block or written as anything
            but a literal boolean in either scope names every such leaf — and
            whether the database path was configured/found/parseable) — never
            the database's file contents or any other secret value.

    """Refuse to enqueue a session/unreviewed plan with no CURRENT passing validation record.

    Defense-in-depth alongside the session-layer LOAD gate
    (`plan_loader.py`'s `_load_plan_file`): that gate already keeps an
    unvalidated session/unreviewed file out of `get_facility_plans().plans`
    entirely, so in the common case this validator finds nothing to reject.
    It exists for the narrow race the load gate can't close on its own — the
    `PlanSpec` `get_facility_plans()` returned to resolve this run's
    `plan_name` moments earlier could be stale by the time launch runs (e.g.
    the session file was edited in between) — so this independently re-reads
    the file straight from `resolve_session_plan_dir()` and re-hashes its
    CURRENT content with `hash_plan_body`, the same normalization the record
    was keyed on, rather than trusting the earlier snapshot.

    Raises `HTTPException(409, ...)` for any plan name backed by a file in
    `resolve_session_plan_dir()` whose current content has no passing
    record — whether or not `get_facility_plans()` currently registers it. The
    refusal body is the queue surface's contract shape, NOT a bare string: this
    gate runs on the enqueue path ahead of `session_upload`'s own
    admissibility check, so for an edited-after-pass session plan it is the
    refusal a caller actually receives, and it must carry the same
    `session_plan_unvalidated` code that check would have carried. Anything
    less and `detail.code` is unreadable for exactly the case the code exists
    to name.
    A name the load gate is quarantining *right now* for lacking a record
    resolves to no `PlanSpec` at all, but its file still exists under the
    session directory; treating that as `session` provenance too (rather than
    "not found") is what turns an already-quarantined plan's launch attempt
    into this clear 409 instead of a confusing "unknown plan" failure further
    downstream. A non-session provenance (`shipped`/`preset`/`facility`), or a
    name with neither a `PlanSpec` nor a session-dir file at all, is left
    alone — the queue server's own "plan not in the allowed namespace"
    rejection is the right place for the latter.
