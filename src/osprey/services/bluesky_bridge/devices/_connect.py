"""Shared device-connection helper for the ophyd-async device factories.

Both factories (``mock.py``, ``epics.py``) build a ``{name: device}`` mapping
whose entries exist only as dict values, then connect them. That connect step
is centralized here so its non-obvious rationale lives in exactly one place.

Imports ophyd-async (a core dependency), so like the rest of ``devices/`` keep
it out of the bridge lifecycle core's import path (``app.py``, ``runs.py``,
``security.py``), which stays import-clean of ophyd.
