"""ophyd-async device factory mediated entirely by the OSPREY connector.

Design reversal (R8): the sibling ``epics.py`` factory was built on an
explicit design ruling that ophyd-async already speaks Channel Access
directly, so no OSPREY connector was needed for the plan device layer.
Phase 4's complete-mediation mandate OVERRIDES that ruling: direct CA from
``epics.py`` is exactly the unmediated second read/write path that
mediation is closing. This module is the replacement device layer — every
plan read and every plan write, for every device built here, goes through
the OSPREY connector
(:class:`osprey.connectors.control_system.base.ControlSystemConnector`):
reads via ``connector.read_channel``, writes via
``connector.write_channel_checked``, which raises on any refused, failed,
mismatched or unconfirmed write so a bad write aborts the RunEngine rather
than silently continuing a plan. There is no raw Channel Access client library,
no low-level EPICS signal backend, and no direct PV access anywhere in
this module.

Device-level delegation over the stable ophyd-async public API (design
decision D1): ``ConnectorSettable``/``ConnectorReadable`` are plain
``StandardReadable`` subclasses that call the connector from ``set()``/
``read()``/``describe()``. This is deliberately NOT a custom
``SignalBackend`` — the ophyd-async ``Signal``/backend protocol is an
internal extension point, while ``StandardReadable``'s ``set``/``read``/
``describe``/``connect`` are the stable public device contract that plans
and the RunEngine actually consume.

Imports ophyd-async (a core dependency), so this module (like the rest of
``devices/``) is kept out of the bridge lifecycle core's import path
(``app.py``, ``runs.py``, ``security.py``), which stays
import-clean of ophyd.

    """A settable/readable PV pair mediated entirely by the OSPREY connector.

    Declares no ophyd-async EPICS signals at all — this package ships no
    direct Channel Access device class, deliberately, so that no read or
    write can bypass the connector's reference monitor. ``set()`` writes the
    setpoint through ``connector.write_channel_checked`` — which raises on
    any refusal, failure, mismatch, or unconfirmed write, aborting the
    RunEngine — then polls the (possibly separate) readback channel through
    ``connector.read_channel`` until it settles within ``_READBACK_DEADBAND``
    of the demanded value, or raises ``TimeoutError`` after
    ``_READBACK_SETTLE_TIMEOUT_S``. ``read()``/``describe()`` are overridden
    to return the *live* readback via the connector on every call — never a
    cached/soft value — so a plan's ``trigger_and_read`` document always
    reflects the current mediated state.

    When ``readback_pv`` is omitted, ``readback`` aliases ``setpoint_pv``:
    there is no independent readback to settle against, and a ``confirmed``
    write already means the connector re-read that exact channel and found
    the value sent, so the settle poll is skipped entirely. The poll loop
    runs when the write was ``unrequested`` (the channel is configured
    ``confirm: false``, so nothing was checked). With a separate
    ``readback_pv`` the write's outcome is about the *setpoint*, not the
    readback channel, so it never stands in for a settle sample there.

    The OSPREY connector instance is stored as ``self._osprey_connector``,
    not ``self._connector``: ophyd-async's own ``Device.__init__`` already
    owns the ``self._connector`` attribute (its internal
    ``DeviceConnector``, used by ``Device.connect()``); reusing that name
    for the OSPREY connector would silently clobber ophyd-async's connect
    machinery.
