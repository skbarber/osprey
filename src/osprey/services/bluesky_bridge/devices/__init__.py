"""ophyd-async device factories for the Bluesky bridge.

Both submodules (``mock.py``, ``connector.py``) import ophyd-async. ophyd-async
is a core dependency, but this package (and its submodules) must still never be
imported from the bridge lifecycle core (``app.py``, ``runs.py``,
``security.py``), which stays import-clean of bluesky/ophyd
so it can be built and unit-tested without loading the device stack. This ``__init__.py`` itself imports nothing from either
submodule, so ``from osprey.services.bluesky_bridge import devices`` alone
stays cheap; callers import ``devices.mock`` or ``devices.connector``
explicitly. There is no raw Channel Access device factory in this package, and
none may be added: every device that talks to a real IOC is mediated by the
OSPREY connector (``devices/connector.py``).
