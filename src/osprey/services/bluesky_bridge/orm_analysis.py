"""Orbit-response-matrix (ORM) analysis: numpy, bluesky-free.

Consumes the plain `dict` rows an `orm` plan run emits (bluesky's event
document `data`, one dict per point — see `plans_core/orm.py`'s `build_plan`), never a
live-buffer or Tiled-specific shape, so this module has no dependency on
`bluesky`/`ophyd-async`/`tiled` and imports cleanly on the MCP side without
loading the bluesky stack (a core dependency, but heavier than this numeric
analysis needs). Its one non-numeric import is `plan_fields.resolve_column`,
which is pydantic-only and carries no stack of its own.

Four pieces:

- `build_response_matrix`: per-(BPM, corrector) slope fit from swept rows.
- `sliced_response_matrix`: the same fit, sliced by acquisition index and
  vectorized — the entry point a plan's `render()` uses on every live tick,
  where `build_response_matrix`'s per-pair `polyfit` over per-row dict scans
  is orders of magnitude too slow.
- `localize_kick`: `lstsq` fault localization against a measured orbit.
- `column_anomaly`/`row_anomaly`: model-free structural fault detectors that
  use only the matrix's own peer/neighbour structure — no independent model
  of the machine is required.

`build_response_matrix`'s fit depends on an invariant the real `orm` plan
upholds (see `plans_core/orm.py`'s `build_plan` docstring): every emitted row carries
EVERY corrector's current, not just the one being swept — a non-swept
corrector simply reads back its idle value in that row. The fit still
recovers the right slope only because each corrector's own sweep is
symmetric about that same idle value: together those put every idle sample
at the fit's x-mean, so it carries zero leverage on the polyfit slope no
matter what BPM reading that row actually carries (driven by whichever OTHER
corrector was being swept at the time). The idle value is NOT assumed to be
zero — the plan sweeps each corrector about its own pre-scan working point,
which on a ring running corrected orbit is nonzero, and restores it there.
`build_response_matrix` checks this per corrector and raises
`DegenerateFitError` if it's violated — see its docstring below.

Channel names are matched to data columns through the bridge's one shared
resolver, `plan_fields.resolve_column` — exact column name first, then the
`f"{channel}-"` prefix spelling. That rule is not this module's to restate:
the two spellings come from the two device implementations (`devices/mock.py`
declares child signals, so a channel lands under `"bpm1-value"`;
`devices/connector.py` emits one entry named for the device, so the same
channel lands under `"bpm1"`), and `resolve_column`'s docstring is where that
is written down.

    """Fit the `[n_bpm, n_corr]` response-slope matrix from emitted ORM rows.

    A real `orm` plan run emits one row per (corrector, current) point, and
    every row carries a value for EVERY corrector in `correctors` — not just
    the one currently being swept (see `plans_core/orm.py`'s `build_plan` docstring) —
    plus a reading for every BPM. For each corrector, every row where that
    corrector's column is present (in practice: every row) forms one
    (current, BPM reading) sample; `numpy.polyfit` (degree 1) over those
    samples gives the response slope for each (BPM, corrector) pair.

    This only recovers the correct slope because the real plan sweeps each
    corrector symmetrically about the very value that corrector reads back
    while idle — its pre-scan working point. That puts the fit's x-mean
    exactly at the idle value (the sweep's own offsets sum to zero), so every
    idle-corrector sample sits exactly at that mean and carries zero leverage
    on the fitted slope — regardless of what BPM reading that row actually
    carries (driven by whichever OTHER corrector was being swept at the
    time). Note the invariant is "centred on the idle value", not "centred on
    zero": zero is simply where a machine with no orbit to correct happens to
    idle, and a real ring's correctors do not.

    Before fitting, each corrector's collected currents are checked against
    that invariant (see `_SWEEP_SYMMETRY_TOL`) by comparing their mean to
    their median. The median IS the idle value for any run this function is
    meant to take: idle samples are `(n_correctors - 1) / n_correctors` of a
    corrector's rows, so they are at least half of them whenever more than
    one corrector was swept, and for a single corrector every sample is a
    swept one and a symmetric sweep's median is its centre either way. A
    sweep not centred on where the corrector idles — an off-centre sweep, a
    one-sided (`monodirectional`) one, or an idle reading with a bias —
    separates mean from median and would silently corrupt the slope, so it
    raises `DegenerateFitError` naming the corrector instead of fitting
    garbage.

    A row missing a given corrector's column entirely — not the real plan's
    shape, but a valid input for a caller building rows by hand (e.g. this
    module's own unit tests) — is simply excluded from that corrector's fit.
    The `continue` below is dead for real `orm` plan output, where every row
    carries every corrector's column; it stays live for hand-built or
    otherwise partial rows.

    A corrector with fewer than two samples (or a BPM missing a reading in
    any of them) leaves its column/entry at ``0.0`` rather than raising —
    an incomplete sweep is a data-quality question for the caller, not a
    reason to abort the whole matrix.

    Raises:
        DegenerateFitError: a corrector's collected currents are not
            symmetric about that corrector's own idle value within

    Attributes:
        correctors: The requested corrector names, in the order given —
            `complete`, `currents` and `readings` are all aligned to this.
        readbacks: The requested BPM names, in the order given — the row axis of

        complete: One flag per requested corrector: `True` when that
            corrector's slice was fitted into a `matrix` column. `False`
            for a slice that is short (the sweep is still in flight, or the
            row buffer ran out), that is missing a corrector current, or
            whose currents never move (nothing to fit a slope against).
        matrix: `[n_readbacks, n_complete]` response slopes. Only complete

            `fitted_correctors` for its column labels; both are ordered as
            `correctors` is.
        fitted_correctors: The names of the correctors that produced a

        currents: Per requested corrector, that corrector's own recorded
            currents over its slice, `[k]` with `k <= num` — the x-axis of a
            sweep trace. Present for incomplete correctors too.
        readings: Per requested corrector, the BPM block over its slice,
            `[k, n_readbacks]` — the y-axes of a sweep trace, one column per BPM.
            Present for incomplete correctors too. A BPM that did not report

    """Fit the response matrix by slicing *rows* into one sweep per corrector.

    Same physics as `build_response_matrix`, different — and much stronger —
    assumption about the input, which buys both correctness on inputs that
    function cannot take and a fit fast enough to run on every live tick.

    The `orm` plan sweeps its correctors strictly one at a time, `num`
    points each, in the order they were requested (see `plans_core/orm.py`'s
    `build_plan`), so corrector `j`'s samples are exactly
    `rows[j * num : (j + 1) * num]` — no need to infer which rows belong to
    which corrector from the data. Each corrector's slope is then fitted
    against its OWN currents over its OWN slice only, which drops
    `build_response_matrix`'s centred-sweep requirement entirely: idle
    correctors' rows are never in the slice to begin with, so a
    `monodirectional` sweep over `[0, span_a]` (which that function rejects
    with `DegenerateFitError`, its polyfit having no way to tell a one-sided
    sweep from a biased idle reading) fits correctly here. A slope is
    invariant to a shift in its x axis, so this path needs to know nothing
    about where a corrector's sweep is centred — a sweep about a nonzero
    working point fits exactly as a sweep about zero does.

    The caller owes that slicing invariant: *rows* must be the run's events
    in emission order, un-truncated at the front and with nothing dropped in
    the middle. A truncated-from-the-front buffer silently misattributes
    every sample, so a caller reading a capped live buffer must check its
    completeness before calling (there is nothing in the rows themselves to
    detect it from). Trailing truncation IS safe and expected — that is just
    a run still in progress, and it shows up as trailing `complete=False`.

    Speed comes from doing the two costly things once instead of per pair:
    channel names are resolved to data columns once for the whole run (rather
    than re-resolving every row for every channel), and each corrector's
    slopes are computed for the whole BPM block at once with the closed-form
    least-squares slope

        slope = (dx @ (Y - Y_mean)) / (dx @ dx),    dx = x - x_mean

    which is what a degree-1 `numpy.polyfit` solves, without building a
    Vandermonde system per (BPM, corrector) pair.

    A slice that is short (the run is still going, or ended early), that is
    missing its corrector's current, or whose currents never move produces
    no matrix column and is flagged `complete=False`; its raw samples are
    still returned for tracing. Inside a complete slice, a BPM that failed
    to report leaves its slope at `0.0` rather than `nan`, matching
    `build_response_matrix` and keeping the matrix usable by
    `column_anomaly`/`row_anomaly`; the `nan` survives in `readings` where a
    trace can show the gap.

    Args:
        rows: The run's event `data` dicts in emission order.
        correctors: Corrector channel names, in the order the plan swept them.
        readbacks: BPM channel names; the matrix's row axis.
        num: Points per corrector sweep — the plan's `num` parameter.

    Raises:
