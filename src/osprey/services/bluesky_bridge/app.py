"""The Bluesky bridge's FastAPI app: the HTTP surface in front of the queue.

Two processes, one machine: this app runs in a separate container from
OSPREY's own venv, reachable only over HTTP plus the ``X-Launch-Token``
header.

The bridge does not run plans. Execution belongs to the queueserver worker
(``qserver_startup.py``), which owns the RunEngine and every device; this
process composes and validates plans, enqueues them through ``queue.py``,
projects the manager's own item state back out as run records (``runs.py``),
and serves the data the document plane buffers. That division is what keeps
this module import-clean of bluesky/ophyd/tiled (``_BRIDGE_ONLY_MODULES``) —
there is no in-process runner left to import them for.

The direct-execute routes that predate the queue (``POST /runs``,
``POST /runs/{id}/launch``, ``POST /draft/run``, ``POST /runs/{id}/stop``)
still answer, with a single machine-readable ``use_the_queue`` refusal naming
the route that replaced each of them — a removed route would 404 and tell a
caller nothing about where its capability went.

    overwriting any existing file of the same name (a name reused for

    validation record no longer matches — the file becomes unvalidated again

    JSON packed into a query string, which every caller would then have to
    encode by hand; every route on this app that takes a nested object takes it
    as a body, and every one that takes query parameters takes scalars.

    Total by construction, exactly like `GET /runs/{id}/figure`: this answer is
    read by the launch-approval gate, and a gate that errors is a gate that
    stops a human from seeing what they are about to approve. So there is one
    payload shape and one 200 — ``ok`` says whether a trajectory was summarized,
    and when it was not, ``reason`` says why in a machine-readable word and
    ``detail`` in a sentence:

    - ``unknown_plan`` — no plan of that name is registered. Not a 404: an
      unknown name is one more reason the gate has no trajectory to show, and
      it arrives in the same shape as every other.
    - ``plan_catalog_unavailable`` — the plan registry itself could not be read.
    - ``queue_unreachable`` — no queue server could be asked to walk the plan:
      none is configured, none answered, or the connection to one could not be
      built from this deployment's settings at all.
    - ``preview_refused`` — the queue server answered and refused the call. Its
      own sentence is relayed in ``detail``: the pre-flight function may not be
      permitted for this deployment, or the worker may not be able to take the
      call right now. The two are not told apart here, because the queue server
      does not distinguish them in any way this process could read without
      pattern-matching its prose.
    - ``preview_timed_out`` — the call was accepted but had not finished inside
      the backend's budget.
    - ``preview_failed`` — the worker ran the pre-flight and the call itself
      failed, or answered with something that is not a summary.
    - ``plan_error`` — the parameters are what could not produce a plan:
      parameters that do not validate, a channel the worker has no device for,
      anything the plan itself raises. ``detail`` carries the worker's own
      reason, which is the same reason a launch would fail with. A body that is
      not a JSON object at all is reported here too — it is the same fault one
      step earlier, and it is answered before the plan is even looked up, so it
      is what a request with both a bad body and an unknown name reports.

    On success the payload carries the worker's summary — ``moves`` (each
    ``{"channel", "target"}``, in the order the run would make them),
    ``total_moves`` (the exact count, whether or not the list holds them all),
    ``truncated``, and the ``move_cap`` the worker collected up to — plus
    ``channels``, this process's own reading of the plan's role declaration

    Answered from structure metadata alone — ``structure_family`` and, for a

    naming a part here costs no payload fetch. That is the whole point: a
    stream's non-table parts are its external arrays (a waveform, an image
    stack), and naming one in a read downloads the entire array before the row
    filter in `_primary_table` throws it away. Reading a run must not cost the
    frames the run happens to carry.

    ``structure_family`` is compared against the bare string ``"table"``
    because Tiled's `StructureFamily` is a ``str`` enum — matching on the value
    keeps `tiled` out of this module's import path (`_BRIDGE_ONLY_MODULES`)
    without a lazy import that buys nothing.

    Order is the container's own part order, then each table's declared column
    order — the order the run was written in. `CompositeClient.read` builds its
    variables from a ``set``, so the read's own order varies with the process's

    The stream client `BlueskyRun` hands back knows where the stream's own
    parts live, so this asks the stream to read itself, and asks its parts what
    they ARE (`_row_part_columns`) rather than hard-coding the name of the one
    that holds the rows. ``.base["internal"]`` is the layout this used to
    depend on from here; a catalog that stored the rows under a different part
    name would still read correctly now.

    The read names the table parts' columns explicitly (`_row_part_columns`)
    rather than leaning on the stream's default projection: the projection this
    bridge serves is `_data_columns`, and a source read that had already
    dropped columns would leave ``seq_num`` — the ordering key the figure path
    sorts on — unavailable.

    Row-shapedness is then decided per variable — one dimension, and as long as
    the row axis — never from whether the read gave every variable the same
    dimension NAME. When a composite read finds parts of differing length it
    privately renames every variable's dimension, and a rule that compared dim
    names would collapse to ``seq_num`` alone and serve a run's real rows as
    ``columns: []``: a silent empty answer a caller cannot tell from a genuinely
    column-less run. The frame is built from the arrays directly for the same
    reason — ``to_dataframe()`` would cross-join variables whose dims were
    renamed apart.

    A stream with no table part at all reads as an empty frame, not an
    exception: it is a real, if column-less, run.

    The read runs with dask's ``dataframe.convert-string`` turned OFF, and that
    is load-bearing rather than tuning. Tiled's table client fetches each
    partition as Arrow and assembles them through dask; with the option on
    (dask's default) dask casts every object-dtype column to a string dtype on
    the way out. For a text column that is a no-op, but a waveform signal is
    stored as an Arrow ``list<double>`` whose cells are arrays, and ``astype``
    on an array is ``str`` of it — so the whole reading arrives as the TEXT
    ``'[0. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.]'``, with the numbers gone before this module
    ever sees them. Measured against the pinned server, not reasoned: the same

    Which cells those are is decided per COLUMN, from the frame's own dtypes,

    same rows in the same order flagged the same way BECAUSE it is one read and
    not two. A run served from Tiled must not look settled on one route and
    in-flight on the other, or ordered on one and shuffled on the other.

    Two situations fall through the live path in `get_run_data` and land here: a
    run with no live buffer at all (a bridge restart drops every buffer, so a
    run that started before it — even one still executing — has nothing in
    memory), and one whose buffer was evicted past `live_rows._MAX_RUNS`. The
    search keys on `osprey_run_id`, the durable stamp the enqueue path threads
    into the item metadata and the worker records onto the start document.

    Every stored row is returned, never a window: a figure is computed over the
    whole run (a windowed ORM fit is silently wrong), and the data route does
    its own bounding afterwards. Rows come back sorted by ``seq_num`` — emission
    order, however the catalog chose to return them — and projected onto the

    means everywhere else, and never the run record: a run still executing

    Row-bounded by design — this never returns an unbounded table. Prefers the
    live-row buffer the document plane fills (see `live_rows.py`) whenever it
    has one: ``partial: true`` while the run is still filling in (before its
    stop doc lands), permanently readable once it's marked completed (see
    `live_rows.py`'s retention bound). ``row_count`` is the *true* total rows
    the run has produced so far, even if that's more than what's physically
    stored — ``truncated`` reflects whether this response's window omits any
    of them.

    ``run_id`` is looked up in the buffer directly, with no indirection through
    any record this process keeps. That one lookup covers both keyings by
    construction: the document plane buffers a queue-executed run under its
    OSPREY run id, while a run reaching a bare recorder with no such id is
    buffered under the RunEngine's own uid (`live_rows.LiveRowRecorder`), and
    either identity is a key a caller can pass here.

    Falls back to `_from_tiled` whenever there is no live buffer to serve. The
    fallback trigger is always ``buf is None`` — a present-but-empty buffer
    (``partial: true``, zero rows) is a real in-flight run and stays on the
    live path; checking "falsy rows" instead would incorrectly divert a running
    plan to Tiled before it has ever written anything there. A run still
    executing after a bridge restart legitimately has no buffer and is served
    from Tiled; that is correct, not a gap.

    Raises 404 when neither source has the run — the MCP `get_run_data` tool
    maps 404 to `unknown_run`, and a 200-empty response would make a
    nonexistent run look like a valid empty run. A deployment with no Tiled at
    all reaches that same 404 for a run it never buffered, which is honest: no
    source this bridge has knows the run.

    Raises 503 when Tiled IS configured and could not be reached. That is a
    different answer from the 404 on purpose, and the difference is the whole
    point: a 404 says the run does not exist, and saying that about a run whose
    catalog merely blinked would send a caller looking for a mistake it did not
    make. 503 says come back — the same line the export route draws between
    `tiled_unavailable` and its other refusals. The detail is a plain sentence,
    the shape every refusal on this route already uses, so the MCP tool renders
    it as `bluesky_bridge_error` with the sentence intact.

    ``run_uid`` is the RunEngine's own uid. Present on the Tiled path (it is on
    the stored start document) and ``None`` on the live path, where the bridge
    holds a buffer but no record of the uid the worker's RunEngine minted. The
    key is always present, so a consumer never has to tell "unknown" apart from
    "this response shape omits it".

    ``analysis`` is the run's peak statistics (`analysis.analyze`), computed
    over the whole run rather than this window and always present: a run that

    **The catalog answered, and its answer was "no".** No catalog configured, no
    run under that id, a run whose ``primary`` stream never landed, a stream with
    no table part — each a named refusal raised here or by
    `_resolve_stored_tables` and passed straight through.

    **The catalog did not answer at all.** Every line of the resolution reaches
    the Tiled server over the network — `from_uri` performs a handshake GET, the
    search is a query, and membership and part iteration both resolve against
    it — so a catalog that is configured but down, restarting, behind a rotated
    key, or simply slow raises from any of them. That is an ordinary operational
    state, not an exotic one, and it becomes 503 `tiled_unavailable` with the
    cause logged. The alternative is what this guard replaced: an unbranchable
    500 with a bare ``Internal Server Error`` body, on a route whose whole
    contract is that a caller can branch on ``detail.code``.

    503 rather than 502 for the outage, deliberately: 502 `export_failed` means
    "the catalog was reached and could not serialize this run", and collapsing
    the two would cost a caller the difference between "retry later" and "this
    run will never export". The figure route draws the same line one route over,
    wrapping `_tiled_run_snapshot` for exactly this reason.

    Only a table part is ever exported, never the run or the stream container:
    the pinned image's container family serves `application/json` alone, so a
    container-level format GET for CSV or parquet answers 406.

    Several table parts are refused rather than picked between, under their own
    `ambiguous_table` code — a caller told `nothing_stored` would act on the
    opposite of what happened, and this route's whole contract is that
    ``detail.code`` is branchable. `TiledWriter` writes one, so this cannot
    happen today — but the read path concatenates every table part's columns
    (`_row_part_columns`) while an export can serialize only one node, so
    silently taking the first would make the export a partial archive with
    nothing to say so, on the one route whose entire promise is completeness. A

    The bytes come from the catalog's own format GET — this route resolves which
    node holds the run's rows, asks Tiled to serialize it, and relays the result.
    Nothing about the file's contents is decided in this process: no reformatting,
    no row limit, no column filter. A caller that wants the parsed, bounded,
    live-comparable view of a run reads `GET /runs/{id}/data`; this route is for
    getting the recorded run *out*, whole, into a tool that reads files.

    Two consequences of that division are worth stating, because they are the
    two ways this answer legitimately differs from the data route's:

    - **Every stored column is present**, including `seq_num`, `time`, and the
      per-signal `ts_*` timestamps that `_data_columns` projects away. Those
      columns exist in the archive and an export is the archive.
    - **Non-scalar signals survive.** A waveform is stored as a list-valued
      column, and Tiled serializes it — as a bracketed cell in CSV, as a native
      list column in parquet.

    ``format`` is a short alias, ``csv`` or ``parquet`` — the two the pinned
    server image serves for every table a run can produce (see
    `_EXPORT_FORMATS`). Anything else is refused by name rather than passed
    through, so an unsupported request is answered by this process with the list
    of what works instead of by the catalog with a 406.

    Total by construction, like the data and figure routes: every failure is a
    ``{"code", "detail"}`` body under a status that says which kind it is —
    400 `unsupported_format`, 404 `unknown_run`, 409 `nothing_stored`,
    409 `ambiguous_table`, 503 `tiled_unavailable`, 502 `export_failed`. The two
    409s are told apart because a caller acts on them differently — nothing to
    serialize versus more than one thing. The two network ones split the
    catalog's failures where a caller can act on the difference: 503 is "could
    not be reached at all, retry later" (`_stored_table_node` owns it, for the
    whole resolution), 502 is "was reached and could not serialize this run",
    which retrying will not fix. Both are catch-alls over an exception the
    catalog raised, because it is a separate process over a network and the ways
    that call can fail are not this module's to enumerate.

    Serving is unbounded by design and the payload is held in memory — more than
    once at peak, not once: Tiled's client reads the whole response body into
    `bytes` before writing it into this route's buffer, and the buffer is copied
    again on the way into the response. Roughly three times the file, briefly.
    That is affordable because a run is bounded, not a stream — the same bound the
    rest of this module relies on — but the multiplier is what to size against,
    not the file.

    ``tiled`` and its Bluesky client plugin stay imported below the routes
    (`_tiled_client`, `_newest_run_node`), so this route adds nothing to the

    store they came from or whether it is still producing them, so both of a
    rendered figure's own values are placeholders by convention (see

      stamp is the ONLY identity source; the run record is never consulted.
    - ``no_render`` — the stamped name has no current owner in the plan
      catalog (removed or renamed since the run), its spec carries no
      ``render``, or the catalog itself failed to load (logged; the one
      non-cacheable case). Figures are always computed by the plan code
      *currently* owning the name.
    - ``render_not_supported_for_session_plans`` — the name resolves to a
      session/unreviewed spec. Decided on provenance, not on ``render is
      None``, so the authoring agent learns *why* rather than seeing a plain
      ``no_render``.
    - ``params_mismatch`` — the stamped kwargs no longer validate against the
      plan's current schema (schema drift since the run), or the source
      snapshot itself is structurally broken (`rows_from_columnar` refuses a
      window claiming more rows than its run, or ragged rows — same treatment:
      the stored shape no longer matches what the code expects).

    """A run's figure: its plan's own view of the rows, or the default view.

    Total over known runs — every run a DATA source knows has a figure, and
    every degradation is a 200 default figure with a machine-readable
    ``reason`` (this route is polled at 1 Hz; a flaky catalog must never
    become a 500). ``partial`` and ``source`` are always present. 404 only
    when neither the live buffer nor Tiled knows the run — byte-for-byte
    `get_run_data`'s 404; the run RECORD is never consulted anywhere here (it
    would need an awaited manager RPC from this sync def, could raise on a
    never-non-200 route, and would make /figure and /data disagree about a
    pending run).

    Settledness comes from the SOURCE only — the live buffer's ``partial``
    flag, or the stop document's presence in Tiled — never from the run
    record, whose terminal status can precede the last rows and survives a
    re-run of an interrupted item under the same run id. Settled figures are
    cached (`figure_cache`) so a second GET on a settled Tiled run issues zero
    Tiled calls; recycled run ids are handled by the document plane's
    invalidate-on-write eviction plus the generation compare-and-set on store.
    Live runs recompute per tick — ~50 ms end-to-end at facility scale, of
    which the vectorized fit is ~15 ms.

    A plain sync ``def`` (threadpool, like `get_run_data`) — no awaits, no
    single-flight; losers of a cache race simply recompute.
