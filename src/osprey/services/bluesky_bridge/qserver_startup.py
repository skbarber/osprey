"""The queueserver RE-worker startup script: devices, plans, and the document plane.

This file is mounted into the ``queueserver`` container and handed to
``start-re-manager`` as its ``--startup-script``. The manager spawns the RE
worker, which ``exec``s this file into the worker's namespace (with
``__name__`` patched to ``"__main__"``) and then scans that namespace for the
``RE`` instance, the plans, and the devices it will expose over its 0MQ
control channel. Everything the worker can ever run therefore has to be built
here, in this process — the bridge is a client of the manager, not its parent.

Three things are assembled, in this order:

1. **Devices** — connector-mediated ``ConnectorSettable``/``ConnectorReadable``
   instances built from the device file named by ``BLUESKY_DEVICES_FILE``,
   exactly as the bridge's in-process wiring built them: every plan read goes
   through ``connector.read_channel`` and every plan write through
   ``connector.write_channel_checked``. Moving execution out of the bridge
   moves the reference monitor here with it — there is no raw Channel Access
   in this process either.
2. **Plans** — the bridge's own layered plan catalog (``plan_loader``, driven
   by the same ``BLUESKY_PLAN_DIRS`` the bridge reads), each catalog entry
   exposed as a named generator function whose ``**kwargs`` are validated
   back into that plan's ``PARAMS`` model and whose device names resolve
   against the device set built in step 1.
3. **The document plane** — a ``TiledWriter`` subscription (gated on
   ``BLUESKY_TILED_URI``) for durable run data, and a
   ``bluesky.callbacks.zmq`` ``Publisher`` (gated on
   ``BLUESKY_ZMQ_PUBLISH_ADDR``) that streams every document to the
   ``zmq.Proxy`` the bridge runs, which is how the bridge's live-row buffer
   sees a run it is no longer executing itself. Both subscriptions are
   fault-isolated: a Tiled outage or a dead proxy degrades telemetry, it never
   aborts a plan.

**Browse-only is the failure mode.** With no readable device file — the mock
connector case — no devices are built, no plans are registered, and the
namespace ends up holding only ``RE``. The script does not raise: the manager
comes up healthy with an empty allowed-plan list, so the queue surface is
fail-closed (nothing to enqueue) instead of offering plans that would fail at
execution time against devices that were never built.

Self-contained on purpose: this module reads its own env and builds its own
connector rather than importing the bridge's in-process runner wiring, which
the queue backend replaces. It runs in a different container from ``app.py``
and must keep working when that wiring is gone. The one thing it does import
from the bridge's side is ``queue_backend``'s lane resolver — which machine
this worker binds to is the same question the bridge answers on its capability
record, and one ladder is what keeps the two containers from describing the
lane differently.

**NEVER use a relative import in this file — not even inside a function.** In
production this module is not imported at all: it is the manager's
``--startup-script``, and upstream's ``load_startup_script`` ``exec``s the file
with ``__name__`` patched to ``"__main__"`` and no ``__package__``, so ``from
.devices import ...`` raises ``ImportError: attempted relative import with no
known parent package`` and the worker environment never opens. Spell every
import absolutely (``from osprey.services.bluesky_bridge... import``). The unit
tests import this module normally, as a package member, where relative imports
resolve fine — so they cannot catch a regression here; the AST pin in
``tests/services/bluesky_bridge/test_qserver_startup.py`` is what does.

    task under its own timeout, which is the bound that applies.
