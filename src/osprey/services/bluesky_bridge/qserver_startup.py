"""The queueserver RE-worker startup script: devices, plans, and the document plane.

This file is mounted into the ``queueserver`` container and handed to
``start-re-manager`` as its ``--startup-script``. The manager spawns the RE
worker, which ``exec``s this file into the worker's namespace (with
``__name__`` patched to ``"__main__"``) and then scans that namespace for the
``RE`` instance, the plans, and the devices it will expose over its 0MQ
control channel. Everything the worker can ever run therefore has to be built
here, in this process — the bridge is a client of the manager, not its parent.

Three things are assembled, in this order:

1. **Devices** — connector-mediated ``ConnectorSettable``/``ConnectorReadable``
   instances built from the substrate env (``BLUESKY_EPICS_SUBSTRATE`` +
   ``BLUESKY_EPICS_SETPOINTS``/``BLUESKY_EPICS_READBACKS``), exactly as the
   bridge's in-process wiring built them: every plan read goes through
   ``connector.read_channel`` and every plan write through
   ``connector.write_channel_checked``. Moving execution out of the bridge
   moves the reference monitor here with it — there is no raw Channel Access
   in this process either.
2. **Plans** — the bridge's own layered plan catalog (``plan_loader``, driven
   by the same ``BLUESKY_PLAN_DIRS`` the bridge reads), each catalog entry
   exposed as a named generator function whose ``**kwargs`` are validated
   back into that plan's ``PARAMS`` model and whose device names resolve
   against the device set built in step 1.
3. **The document plane** — a ``TiledWriter`` subscription (gated on
   ``BLUESKY_TILED_URI``) for durable run data, and a
   ``bluesky.callbacks.zmq`` ``Publisher`` (gated on
   ``BLUESKY_ZMQ_PUBLISH_ADDR``) that streams every document to the
   ``zmq.Proxy`` the bridge runs, which is how the bridge's live-row buffer
   sees a run it is no longer executing itself. Both subscriptions are
   fault-isolated: a Tiled outage or a dead proxy degrades telemetry, it never
   aborts a plan.

**Browse-only is the failure mode.** With no substrate env — the mock
connector case — no devices are built, no plans are registered, and the
namespace ends up holding only ``RE``. The script does not raise: the manager
comes up healthy with an empty allowed-plan list, so the queue surface is
fail-closed (nothing to enqueue) instead of offering plans that would fail at
execution time against devices that were never built.

Self-contained on purpose: this module reads its own env and builds its own
connector rather than importing the bridge's in-process runner wiring, which
the queue backend replaces. It runs in a different container from ``app.py``
and must keep working when that wiring is gone.

**NEVER use a relative import in this file — not even inside a function.** In
production this module is not imported at all: it is the manager's
``--startup-script``, and upstream's ``load_startup_script`` ``exec``s the file
with ``__name__`` patched to ``"__main__"`` and no ``__package__``, so ``from
.devices import ...`` raises ``ImportError: attempted relative import with no
known parent package`` and the worker environment never opens. Spell every
import absolutely (``from osprey.services.bluesky_bridge... import``). The unit
tests import this module normally, as a package member, where relative imports
resolve fine — so they cannot catch a regression here; the AST pin in
``tests/services/bluesky_bridge/test_qserver_startup.py`` is what does.

    Exposed to the manager as a namespace *function* (``function_execute``),

    it as a callable to invoke directly rather than as a plan to hand the
    RunEngine, and it is the single deliberate exception in an otherwise
    deny-all function permission list. It moves nothing — see
    :func:`collect_channel_moves` for why walking a plan's message stream
    cannot.

    Reads the *live* worker namespace (this module's globals, which upstream
    ``exec``s the startup script into and :func:`build_namespace` populates), so
    the devices resolved here are the connected, mock-free devices the run
    itself would use.

        ``move_cap`` entries; ``total_moves`` is the exact count regardless, and
        ``truncated`` is True when the list is only its opening slice. On
        failure — an unknown plan, kwargs the params schema rejects, a device
        this worker never built, or anything the plan raises while building —
