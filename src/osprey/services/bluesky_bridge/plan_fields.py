"""Role-typed channel fields: how a plan author *declares* what each parameter does.

A plan's ``PARAMS`` model already names the channels a run touches, but a
bare ``list[str]`` says nothing about what will be done to them. Everything
downstream -- the load gate, the enqueue pre-check, dry-run mocks, the default
figure, the pre-flight summary -- needs to know which channels the plan *moves*
and which it merely *reads*, and until now each of those consumers guessed from
the field's name. This module replaces the guessing with a declaration.

An author annotates the field with one of the role types::

    class PARAMS(BaseModel):
        correctors: MovableChannels = Field(..., min_length=1, title="Correctors")
        monitors: ReadableChannels = Field(..., min_length=1)

Each type is a plain ``list[str]`` / ``str`` carrying one extra JSON-schema key,
``x-channel-role``, whose value is ``"movable"`` or ``"readable"``. The
singles (`MovableChannel` / `ReadableChannel`) exist for nested models, where
one field holds one channel name rather than a list. A parameter that may be
left unset takes the optional singles (`OptionalMovableChannel` /
`OptionalReadableChannel`) -- their own types rather than a ``| None`` at the
field site, because pydantic only lifts an ``Annotated`` declaration into the
field's own metadata when it is the outermost annotation: spelled
``MovableChannel | None``, the role silently reads back as no declaration at
all, which is a plan whose channel no consumer collects (pinned by this
module's tests).

Two properties consumers rely on:

- **The role is additive.** It constrains nothing and validates nothing; it only
  records intent. An author still spells out ``min_length``, ``title``,
  ``description`` and any ``x-widget`` presentation hint on the field itself, and
  those survive alongside the role -- pydantic merges the annotation's
  ``json_schema_extra`` with the field's own rather than replacing it (pinned by
  this module's tests, because two shipped plans depend on it).
- **The role is introspectable from both sides.** It lands in
  ``model_fields[name].json_schema_extra`` for code walking the model, and under
  ``x-channel-role`` in ``model_json_schema()`` for anything reading the
  serialized schema -- nested inside the ``$defs`` entry when the annotated field
  lives on a nested model. Consumers that resolve ``$ref``s therefore see it too.

Reading the declaration back is `channel_roles` (what a model declares) and
`collect_channels` (what one set of parameters supplies for a role) -- the
single authority every consumer uses instead of inspecting field names.
`resolve_column` is the matching lookup on the other end, finding a channel's
column in a run's data.

Vocabulary: this module speaks only capability language -- a channel is
*movable* (the plan drives it to a value) or *readable* (the plan records it).
That is the vocabulary of every author-facing and operator-facing surface;
`scan_metadata` is the one function that translates it into the run's standard
metadata keys, and no consumer spells those keys itself.

Kept pydantic-only (no bluesky/ophyd/tiled imports) so every consumer on the
bridge's import-clean side -- the loader, the queue routes, the figure route --
can import it freely.

    - an interval count, which stock plans derive as ``points - 1``: true only

    - a dimensionality hint, for the same reason -- a serial per-channel sweep
