"""Server-held shared plan draft: the agent's and the human's collaborative
scratch pad for composing one Bluesky plan before it is queued.

One in-process singleton draft (`{plan_name, plan_args, updated_by,
updated_at}`) plus a process-lifetime monotonic revision counter, guarded by
one `asyncio.Lock` so read-modify-broadcast is atomic and revision order
always equals SSE frame order. This module is intentionally its own
`APIRouter` (mounted into `app.py` via `include_router`) rather than more
inline `@app.<verb>` routes — the draft's state, lock, and broadcaster are
self-contained and don't need anything else `app.py` owns.

Per-field value validation (`PATCH /draft`'s `plan_args_patch`) uses
``TypeAdapter(Annotated[field.annotation, field])`` — the field's own
``FieldInfo`` instance as the ``Annotated`` metadata directly, NOT unpacked
with a leading ``*``. The starred form (``Annotated[field.annotation,
*field.metadata]``) raises ``TypeError`` for any field with no
``Field()``-level constraints (its ``metadata`` list is empty, and
``Annotated`` requires at least one metadata argument) — verified against
pydantic 2.12.5. Passing the ``FieldInfo`` itself works uniformly whether or
not the field carries constraints, which is why every per-field validation
call in this module goes through :func:`_validate_field` rather than
resolving a fresh adapter ad hoc.

Every coerced value is additionally passed back through
``TypeAdapter.dump_python(..., mode="json")`` before being stored. Without
this, a field typed as a nested pydantic model (e.g. `grid_scan`'s
``axes: list[GridAxis]``) would store raw model instances in ``plan_args``:
not JSON-serializable by the plain ``json.dumps`` the SSE broadcaster uses,
and not comparable by ordinary ``==`` in the exact same way plain dicts are
for :func:`_diff_keys`. Dumping to JSON-safe primitives up front keeps the
draft's on-the-wire and in-memory representations identical.

Plan-model resolution (`get_facility_plans()`) does synchronous file I/O — it
re-scans the session-plan directory on every call (see `plan_loader.py`).
Whenever a `PATCH` names a `plan_name`, that resolution runs via
``asyncio.to_thread`` *before* the draft lock is acquired, and the resolved
schema class is cached on the new draft object; every subsequent per-field
validation (until the next `plan_name` change) reads that cached class only
— no further registry calls. This module never copies the artifacts
interface's `_SSEBroadcaster` cross-thread ``put_nowait`` pattern
(`interfaces/artifacts/app.py`): every mutation here happens inside an
``async def`` route already running on the event loop, so a synchronous
``put_nowait`` from within the same coroutine, under the same lock that just
bumped the revision, is safe and requires no cross-thread handoff.
