"""The facility plan-injection contract's shared type: ``PlanSpec``.

Kept free of bluesky/ophyd/tiled imports (pydantic is a core bridge dependency,
pulled in transitively via FastAPI, so it's fine here) so both sides of the
injection seam stay on the right side of the import-clean boundary:

- ``plan_loader.py`` loads a facility module exposing
  ``PLANS: dict[str, PlanSpec]`` from a config-pointed path *without* itself
  importing bluesky — only the loaded module needs it.
- the shipped plan files under ``plans_core/`` (e.g. ``orm.py``, ``grid_scan.py``)
  build their ``PlanSpec`` by wrapping ``bluesky.plans`` callables; they import
  bluesky, but doing so here in the shared type would force that import onto the
  loader too.

A plan's ``plan`` callable is intentionally opaque: ``(devices, params) ->
Any``, where ``devices`` is whatever ``get_devices()`` returned and ``params``
is a validated instance of ``schema``. Neither this module nor callers need to
know if the callable returns a real bluesky plan generator or, in a test
double, something else entirely.

A plan's optional ``render`` callable is the opposite — fully typed, because
it is the seam the figure route serves to the panel and the agent. ``figure.py``
is pydantic-only, so importing `Figure` here costs the loader nothing.

@dataclass
class PlanSpec(Generic[SchemaT]):
    """One registered plan: its name, parameter schema, and implementation.

    Generic over its own ``schema`` type so each concrete plan's ``plan``
    callable can be typed against its own pydantic model (e.g. ``CountParams``)
    rather than the common ``BaseModel`` supertype — callers that don't care
    about a specific plan's schema can still hold these as ``PlanSpec[Any]``.

    ``render`` is the plan's own view of a run: ``(window, params) ->
    Figure``, where ``window`` is a `RowWindow` — the run's data rows as plain
    dicts *plus* how much of the run they are — and ``params`` is a validated
    ``schema`` instance — the *same* ``SchemaT``, so a plan whose ``render``
    takes anything other than its own PARAMS is a type error rather than a
    runtime surprise at the first poll tick. The window rather than a bare
    row list because a render that reads rows positionally cannot tell a whole
    run from a truncated one by looking at the rows, and guessing (comparing
    the row count against a duplicated copy of the buffer's cap) is a guess
    that goes stale silently. ``None`` (the default) means the plan has no view
    of its own and the bridge's default figure stands in for it. The loader
    only ever populates this for operator-supplied tiers; see
    ``plan_loader._resolve_render``.

    ``roles`` is what the plan's ``schema`` declared about its channel fields:
    ``(field_path, role)`` pairs exactly as ``plan_fields.channel_roles``
    returns them — depth-first in declaration order, paths spelled
    ``"correctors"`` / ``"axes[].setpoint"``. The loader introspects the schema
    once at load time and stores the result here, so request-time consumers
    (the enqueue pre-check, the pre-flight preview, the default figure,
    analysis) read the declaration off the spec instead of re-walking the model
    on every call. An empty tuple (the default, so a hand-built ``PlanSpec``
    stays valid) means the schema declares no channel roles at all.
