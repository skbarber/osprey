"""Content-hash-keyed store of PASSING plan-validation records.

The bridge otherwise holds no state of its own — even run records are a
projection over what the queue manager already has (``runs.py``). This module
is a bounded, explicit exception:
a session-tier plan file must be validated (``plan_validation.py``'s
:func:`~osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.plan_validation.validate_plan`)
before anything downstream will treat it as real, and re-validating on every
load/launch check would mean re-running the stage-3 dry-run subprocess on
every request. Instead, the validate route calls
:func:`~osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.plan_validation.hash_plan_body` once and
records a PASS here by that hash; the session-layer load gate and the enqueue
gate re-hash the file's *current* on-disk content the same way and ask whether
that hash has a passing record.

Only a passing validation is ever recorded — a failed validation records
nothing, so an unknown hash and a previously-failed hash are indistinguishable
to :meth:`ValidationRecordStore.has_passing_record` (both answer ``False``).
This also means an edit to a previously-passing file changes its content hash
and silently drops back to "no record" until re-validated — exactly the
re-check the load and enqueue gates need.

In-memory only: a bridge restart loses every record, so a session plan that
passed validation before a restart must be re-validated before it can be
loaded or enqueued again.
