"""Loads plans from a layered directory catalog plus the legacy facility
plan-injection contract, and merges both into one trust-resolved plan set.

Two kinds of plan source, both scanned into the same fail-closed registry:

- **Directory layers** — ordered ``(directory, provenance)`` pairs, each
  scanned for ``.py`` files exposing ``PLAN_METADATA``/``build_plan``
  (optionally ``PARAMS`` and ``render``). Device-agnostic: these files never define
  ``get_devices()``; their plans resolve device names against the bridge's
  own device map at launch.
- **The legacy single-module contract** — a single ``.py`` file exposing
  ``PLANS: dict[str, PlanSpec]`` and ``get_devices()``, resolved from
  ``BLUESKY_PLAN_MODULE`` (env) or ``bluesky.plan_module`` (config.yml). It is
  folded in as a one-entry ``facility``-tier layer — and is the only source of
  injected devices.

Layer sources and their provenance-tier mapping:

1. ``shipped`` — the in-image core dir bundled with this package
   (``plans_core/``, alongside this module). May not exist yet in a given
   install; an absent/empty directory is not an error.
2. ``preset`` — directories listed in ``bluesky.plan_dirs`` in config.yml.
   Config-shipped and versioned with a deployment's config bundle: lower
   operator trust than a per-instance runtime override.
3. ``facility`` — directories listed in ``BLUESKY_PLAN_DIRS`` (env,
   ``os.pathsep``-separated), set per bridge instance at launch. This mirrors
   the legacy contract's own precedent that an env override outranks
   config (``BLUESKY_PLAN_MODULE`` wins over ``bluesky.plan_module``). The
   legacy single-module contract itself is also pinned to ``facility`` —
   it is scanned *first*, so a lower-trust directory layer (``shipped`` or
   ``preset``) can never silently reclaim a name it already owns; only an
   equal- or higher-trust directory layer can.

Trust order (ascending): ``shipped < preset < facility < session <
unreviewed``. A same-name collision across layers is resolved fail-closed:
a strictly-higher-trust incoming plan overrides (warns); a strictly-lower-
trust incoming plan is rejected outright (errors, keeps the existing
registration); an equal-trust collision lets the later-scanned definition win
(warns) — same-tier directories are all operator-controlled, so there is no
principled tie-breaker beyond scan order.

4. ``session`` — the bridge-owned, writable directory resolved by
   ``session_dir.resolve_session_plan_dir()``. Unlike every layer above, this
   one is agent-authored, not operator-supplied — so a ``session`` (or a
   future ``unreviewed``) file is subject to an additional LOAD-TIME gate
   (``_load_plan_file``) before it is ever ``exec_module``'d: its current
   on-disk content is hashed with ``plan_validation.hash_plan_body`` and
   checked against ``validation_record.validation_records`` for a passing
   record. No record, no exec — the file is skipped like any other
   quarantined file, never registered, never launchable. This is the
   feature's primary enforcement point: it runs on every scan (see
   ``get_facility_plans``), so an edit that invalidates a previously-passing
   file's hash re-quarantines it on the very next scan. Higher-trust tiers
   carry no such gate — they are exec'd on discovery unconditionally, as
   they always have been.

Deliberately free of bluesky/ophyd/tiled imports — this module only execs
plan files and reads pydantic metadata; only a loaded module itself needs
bluesky. The bluesky stack is a core dependency now, but keeping this module
import-clean of it still lets `plan_loader.py` be imported in any bridge process
without loading the RunEngine.

    outcome here is ``None``, which the figure route serves as the default
    figure with a reason attached.

    The rule, by tier:

    - ``session``/``unreviewed`` — never resolved, even when the file defines
      one. ``render()`` runs in the bridge API process on every poll tick of

      ``render_not_supported_for_session_plans`` reason so the author sees the
      same words the panel will show them. A file that declares none is
      silent — there is nothing to warn about.
    - ``shipped``/``preset``/``facility`` — a callable module-level ``render``
      is stored on the spec. A *missing* one is silent and ordinary (most

    missing `build_plan`, malformed `PARAMS`, an undeclared write — see the load
    gate below) is logged as a warning and the file is quarantined — skipped,
    without aborting the rest of the scan.

    Catches `SystemExit` alongside `Exception` (it isn't an `Exception`
    subclass) so a plan file that calls `sys.exit()` at import time is
    quarantined like any other bad file rather than aborting the whole
    directory scan — today's shipped/preset/facility tiers are all
    operator-trusted, but this same scan path is where the untrusted
    `session`/`unreviewed` tier lands, where one authored `sys.exit()`
    would otherwise be a sibling-plan discovery denial-of-service. Deliberately
    NOT widened to bare `BaseException`: a genuine `KeyboardInterrupt` or
    `GeneratorExit` must still propagate — an operator's Ctrl-C is not a
    plan-file failure.

    For `provenance in ("session", "unreviewed")` only, a LOAD-TIME gate runs
    first: the file's current content is hashed with
    `plan_validation.hash_plan_body` and checked against
    `validation_record.validation_records` for a passing record. No record,
    no `exec_module` — the file is skipped exactly like a quarantined file
    (never registered, never launchable). Higher-trust tiers (`shipped`,
    `preset`, `facility`) carry no such gate; they are `exec_module`'d on
    discovery unconditionally, as they always have been. Gating strictly on
    provenance (not on "no metadata"/"no record" alone) matters: built-ins and
    the shipped exemplars carry no validation record either, and a broader
    gate would wrongly quarantine them too.

    Every tier passes one further contract check, the LOAD GATE: a plan whose
    metadata declares ``writes: true`` must name at least one movable channel
    field in its ``PARAMS`` (read via `plan_fields.channel_roles`). A plan that
    claims to change machine state without declaring what it moves is
    unenforceable downstream — the enqueue pre-check, the pre-flight preview and
    the permission entries all describe a write in terms of those declared
    fields, and with none of them there is nothing to check, show, or arm.
    Catching it at load time makes it an authoring error the author sees once,
    rather than a silently under-described write at every launch. The reverse
    (declared movable fields with ``writes: false``) is deliberately NOT gated:
    that direction fails safe, and a plan may legitimately take a channel name
    it only reads back. Plans are stored with their introspected roles on
    `PlanSpec.roles`, so no request-time consumer re-walks the schema.

    An optional module-level ``render`` is resolved onto the spec by
    `_resolve_render`, which is total: no ``render`` attribute, an unusable
    one, or an untrusted tier all yield ``render=None``, and the plan itself
