"""Static path policy for user-submitted code — mode-independent write refusal.

PURPOSE: Catch *literal* write intent aimed at the render zone or the profile
source set before the code is ever spawned, so the agent gets a readable
refusal instead of a runtime traceback. This is a pre-check, not the
enforcement boundary: the boundary is the emitted runtime guard
(``fs_guard.render_fs_guard``), which patches the filesystem entry points in
the child process and therefore sees the paths this walker cannot.

Two things are deliberately *deferred* to that runtime guard rather than
guessed at here:

* **Dynamic paths.** ``open(target, 'w')`` carries no literal to resolve. No
  issue is emitted — a static walker that guessed would either refuse
  legitimate work or give false comfort.
* **Dynamic modes.** ``open('build/config.yml', mode)`` may well be a read.
  The runtime guard refuses it if it turns out to be a write, so nothing is
  lost by staying quiet.

Matching is by *function name* (``.rmtree``, ``.copy``, ``os.remove``), not by
the module the caller happened to bind, so ``import shutil as sh`` is still
seen. That breadth is safe because an issue also requires the resolved literal
path to land inside a protected root; aliasing games that defeat name matching
entirely (``getattr(shutil, 'rmtree')``) fall through to the runtime guard like
any other dynamic call.

The policy is applied in **every** execution mode. Readonly and readwrite runs
alike may not write into the render zone or the profile sources — that is the
self-change boundary, not a control-system write gate.

The walker carries two checks that are *not* about paths, both aimed at code
that takes the runtime guard down rather than spelling a path around it. The
guard cannot police either one — nothing rendered into the child can be hidden
from the child, and neither attempt calls a patched entry point on the way — so
a static layer, here, before the child is spawned, is the only one that can
refuse them:

* **Naming the guard's own identifiers** (``_restore_patched_targets``,
  ``_osprey_fs_check``, the ``_OSPREY_FS_*`` tables).
* **Reloading a module the guard patched** (``importlib.reload(os)``). A reload
  re-executes the module and restores its original attributes, taking the
  guard's rebindings with them — a plainer spelling of the same disarm.

Unlike the path checks these do not defer dynamic spellings, because a string
literal handed to ``getattr`` or to ``sys.modules[...]`` is the normal way both
are attempted rather than an edge case. What neither check reaches is a binding
it cannot see the name of — ``import os as _o; reload(_o)`` reads as a reload of
something unguarded. That is the honest limit of a static layer: it raises the
cost of a disarm, it does not make one impossible. The boundary that holds
against code deliberately attacking it is the operating system's — the
container's privilege split, where the render zone and the profile sources
belong to a different user than the one running agent code.
