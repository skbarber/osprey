#: Message raised by every refused write in a readonly run. Tests match on

#: The substring every readonly refusal message carries, whichever layer
#: raised it. The wrapper guard raises :data:`READONLY_REFUSAL`; the connector
#: reference monitor raises its own, channel-named message
#: (``osprey_connectors.control_system.base._writes_disabled_result``). Both
#: reach the tool layer only as a traceback on the subprocess's stderr, so the
#: tool matches on what they share rather than on either full message — which
#: is what lets a write refused through the *approved* ``write_channel`` path
#: be alerted and audited exactly like one refused by the guard.
#:
#: A test pins the connector's message against this constant, so rewording
#: either side without the other fails rather than silently stopping the alert.
READONLY_REFUSAL_MARKER = "readonly execution mode"

#: Refusal prefix the filesystem guard carries in a readonly run. It embeds
#: :data:`READONLY_REFUSAL_MARKER` so that a write refused into the render zone
#: or the profile sources reaches the operator alert and the audit ledger by the
#: same path a refused control-system write does — ``report_runtime_refusal``
#: scans the subprocess's stderr for that marker and nothing else.
READONLY_FS_REFUSAL_PREFIX = f"Refused ({READONLY_REFUSAL_MARKER}):"

#: The same refusal in a readwrite run. It names the protected path and says
#: nothing about the mode: the run *is* readwrite, and telling the agent to
#: "resubmit with execution_mode='readwrite'" would be advice it has already
#: taken. Deliberately NOT carrying the readonly marker — see
#: :meth:`ExecutionWrapper._get_filesystem_guard` for what that costs and why it
#: is still the right trade.
READWRITE_FS_REFUSAL_PREFIX = DEFAULT_DENYLIST_PREFIX


#: Every entry point a readonly run refuses, as ``(dotted target, attributes)``.
#: This table is the canonical machine-readable answer to "what counts as a
#: control-system write from Python" — the docs list is written from it, and a
#: library added here needs no other change to be enforced.
#:
#: The dotted target is resolved by importing its longest importable prefix and
#: then walking attributes, so a module (``epics``), a module attribute
#: (``epics.ca``) and a class (``p4p.client.thread.Context``) are all spelled
#: the same way. Attributes that do not exist on the resolved object are
#: skipped, which is what makes listing several client flavours free: an
#: uninstalled or older library simply contributes nothing.
#:
#: Patching the object in ``sys.modules`` — rather than inspecting the source —
#: is what makes this immune to spelling. ``importlib.import_module("epics")``,
#: ``from epics import caput as _w`` and ``getattr(epics, "ca" + "put")`` all
#: end up holding the refusing function, because they all resolve through the
#: one module object this mutates.

        Args:
            limits_validator: Optional LimitsValidator instance for channel checking
            execution_mode: The mode the script was submitted under. A
                ``"readonly"`` run gets the readonly guard (every direct
                control-system write entry point refuses at runtime); the
                default is readonly so a wrapper built without a mode fails
                closed. It does **not** decide whether the filesystem guard is
                installed — that one is unconditional — only how its refusals
                are worded.
            protected_roots: Absolute, already-resolved paths executed code may
                not write into, in either mode: the render zone and the profile
                source set. This is the self-change boundary, not a
                control-system write gate, which is why the mode does not enter
                into it. Resolved by the parent
                (:func:`osprey.mcp_server.python_executor.executor.resolve_protected_roots`)
                and baked into the emitted guard as literals — a child that
                re-derived them could be pointed at different ones by the very
                code the guard exists to contain. Empty leaves the guard
                installed and refusing nothing, which is what a caller that
                knows no project layout (a unit test, a bare ``ExecutionWrapper()``)
                should get.
            permitted_roots: Absolute, already-resolved paths carved back out of
                the protected set — the agent's own data zone. The execution
                folder is added to this in :meth:`_get_filesystem_guard`, since
                that is the one root the wrapper knows and the parent does not
                until the folder exists.
            perimeter_denied_ports: Host ports on this machine that executed code
                may not connect to — the web ports of a deployment whose
                perimeter authenticates on the caller's behalf, where a request
                made from inside a terminal container would arrive already
                credentialed as whoever owns the port. Resolved by the parent
                (:func:`osprey.mcp_server.python_executor.executor._perimeter_denied_ports`,
                which reads the deployment's stamp) and passed as literals for
                the same reason ``protected_roots`` is: a child that re-derived
                the set could equally derive an empty one. Empty — the default,
                and what every non-open posture yields — means no ports are
                denied and no network guard is emitted at all
                (:meth:`_get_net_guard`); a non-empty set puts the guard in
                front of user code in **every** execution mode, because the
                perimeter is orthogonal to the write posture.

        """Generate the runtime filesystem guard. Emitted in EVERY mode.

        This is a different boundary from the readonly guard above, and the two
        are deliberately not folded together. The readonly guard answers "may
        this run touch the control system"; this one answers "may this run
        rewrite the thing that builds it". A readwrite run has human approval to
        move a magnet — it has no approval to overwrite ``profile.yml`` or the
        render zone, and there is no mode in which it does. So the guard is
        installed unconditionally and the mode selects only the wording:

        * readonly → :data:`READONLY_FS_REFUSAL_PREFIX`, which carries
          :data:`READONLY_REFUSAL_MARKER`. That marker is what
          ``report_runtime_refusal`` scans the subprocess's stderr for, so a
          refused write into the render zone is alerted and written to the
          audit ledger exactly like a refused control-system write.
        * readwrite → :data:`READWRITE_FS_REFUSAL_PREFIX`, which names the
          protected path and makes no claim about the mode.

        **Readwrite refusals are not audited**, and that is a decision rather
        than an oversight. The audit path is reached only by the readonly
        marker, and the marker is a factual claim about the run: carrying it in
        a readwrite run would put "readonly execution mode" in front of an
        operator whose run was approved for writes, and would record the
        refusal under a layer that names the wrong gate ("BLOCKED a
        control-system write in readwrite mode"). The refusal itself still
        holds and still reaches the agent and the operator as the traceback in
        the run's stderr. Auditing a protected-path refusal in its own right
        wants its own layer and its own marker on both ends — the ledger's
        writer and the tool that matches it — which is a change to files this
        does not own.

        The roots are resolved in the parent and interpolated as literals; the
        child never re-derives them. ``permitted_roots`` is checked before
        ``protected_roots`` by the renderer, which is what lets the execution
        folder and the agent-data zone keep taking writes while sitting under a
        project root whose render zone is refused.

        **This is defense in depth, not a security boundary.** The guard is
        emitted *into* the child and installs itself in the same module
        namespace as the user code, restore handle and all, so code that knows
        it is there disarms it in two lines::

            _restore_patched_targets()
            open('bui' + 'ld/x', 'w')     # unguarded

        Nothing rendered into the child can be hidden from the child, so that
        is a property of the approach rather than a bug in it, and a
        characterization test pins it
        (``tests/services/python_executor/test_fs_guard.py::TestTamperLimit``)
        so the limit stays stated rather than assumed. What this guard closes
        is the gap the static pre-execution walker cannot see — the
        concatenated or computed path, and the ordinary accident of writing one
        directory too high. What contains code that is deliberately attacking
        the boundary is the OS: the container's privilege split, where the
        render zone and the profile sources belong to a different user than the
        one executing agent code.

                wrapper's ``save_artifact`` and figure writes keep working. It
