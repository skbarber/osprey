"""Renderer for the runtime filesystem guard emitted into executed scripts.

PURPOSE: One emitter, two callers, two postures. The visualization sandbox
(``mcp_server/workspace/execution/sandbox_executor.py``) needs an **allowlist**
— nothing is reachable unless a root says so. The python executor
(``services/python_executor/execution/wrapper.py``) needs a **denylist** —
everything is reachable except writes into the render zone and the profile
source set. Those are the same guard with the verdict inverted, so they are
rendered from the same function rather than maintained as two divergent
inline blocks.

Why *emitted source* and not an importable guard: the guard runs in a spawned
child that must not depend on osprey being importable there. Everything below
the ``render_fs_guard`` return is therefore self-contained text — it imports
only ``builtins``/``io``/``os``/``shutil``/``pathlib`` and closes over nothing
from the parent. Roots are baked in as repr'd string tuples, resolved *by the
caller*: the parent knows the project layout, the child must never re-derive
it (a child that resolved its own roots could be pointed at different ones by
the very code the guard is meant to contain).

Two postures, spelled precisely:

``default_deny=True`` (sandbox)
    Reads are allowed under ``bypass_prefixes`` (the Python environment) and
    under ``read_roots`` (the project tree — readable data, refused writes).
    Reads *and* writes are allowed under ``permitted_roots``. Everything else
    raises ``PermissionError``.

``default_deny=False`` (executor)
    Everything is allowed except a write landing inside ``protected_roots``,
    which raises ``PermissionError``. ``permitted_roots`` carves exceptions
    *out of* the protected set, which is how the wrapper keeps writing its own
    metadata and artifacts under a protected parent.

``write_modes_only_targets`` exists for one specific reason: CPython's
``pathlib`` routes through ``io.open``, not ``builtins.open``. Patching
``io.open`` outright would change pathlib *read* behaviour, which the
characterization suite pins. Patching it for write modes only closes
``Path.write_text`` while leaving ``Path.read_text`` exactly as it is today.

LIMIT — defense in depth, not a security boundary
-------------------------------------------------
This guard runs **inside** the child interpreter, in the same module namespace
as the code it is guarding, and it leaves its own restore handle in that
namespace. Code that knows the guard is there can simply take it down::

    _restore_patched_targets()       # the guard's own uninstall, in scope
    open('bui' + 'ld/x', 'w')        # now completely unguarded

That is not a defect to be patched around — nothing rendered *into* the child
can be hidden from the child. It is pinned by a characterization test
(``tests/services/python_executor/test_fs_guard.py::TestTamperLimit``) so the
stance stays a documented fact rather than an assumption someone later mistakes
for a boundary.

Two things the guard deliberately does *not* treat as paths: an integer file
descriptor (it names no path) and any candidate ``os.fsdecode`` cannot read.
Bytes are a path, though — ``fsdecode`` normalizes them before the comparison,
because ``os.fsencode``, ``os.listdir(b'.')`` and C extensions all produce them
in ordinary code that never meant to spell a path unusually.

What this guard *is* for is the honestly-spelled-around path: the concatenated,
computed or ``os.path``-assembled target that the static pre-execution walker
cannot see, and the ordinary accident where analysis code writes its output one
directory too high. What stops code that is deliberately attacking the boundary
is the operating system — the container's privilege split, where the render
zone and the profile sources are owned by a different user than the one running
agent code. Widening the patch set below raises the cost of an accident and
closes routes reached by mistake; it does not make the guard a sandbox.
