"""Execution Control Configuration for Python Executor Service.

This module provides specialized execution control configuration for the Python
executor service, with particular focus on EPICS (Experimental Physics and
Industrial Control System) integration and security policies. It defines execution
modes that determine the level of system access and control permissions available
to executed Python code.

The module implements a security-conscious approach to execution control, providing
clear separation between read-only operations (safe for automated execution) and
write operations (requiring additional approval and oversight). This is particularly
important in scientific and industrial control environments where code execution
can have real-world physical consequences.

Key Components:
    - **ExecutionMode**: Enumeration of available execution environments with
      different security and access profiles
    - **ExecutionControlConfig**: Configuration class that determines execution
      mode selection based on code analysis and security policies
    - **Configuration Utilities**: Helper functions for creating and validating
      execution control configurations

The execution control system integrates with the static code analysis pipeline
to automatically determine appropriate execution environments based on the
operations detected in generated code, while providing override capabilities
for manual control when needed.

.. note::
   This module is specifically designed for EPICS integration but can be extended
   for other control systems or security-sensitive environments.

.. warning::
   Write-enabled execution modes can perform system operations with real-world
   consequences. Ensure proper approval workflows are configured before enabling
   write access in production environments.

Examples:
    Basic execution control configuration::

        >>> config = ExecutionControlConfig(control_system_writes_enabled=False)
        >>> mode = config.get_execution_mode(
        ...     has_epics_writes=True,
        ...     has_epics_reads=True
        ... )
        >>> print(f"Selected mode: {mode}")
        Selected mode: ExecutionMode.READ_ONLY

    Enabling write operations with proper safeguards::

        >>> write_config = ExecutionControlConfig(control_system_writes_enabled=True)
        >>> mode = write_config.get_execution_mode(
        ...     has_epics_writes=True,
        ...     has_epics_reads=False
        ... )
        >>> print(f"Write mode: {mode}")
        Write mode: ExecutionMode.WRITE_ACCESS

    Configuration validation::

        >>> warnings = config.validate()
        >>> if warnings:
        ...     print(f"Configuration warnings: {warnings}")

    This enum defines the available execution environments for Python code execution,
    each with different levels of system access and security constraints. The modes
    are designed to provide appropriate isolation and control for different types
    of operations, particularly in scientific and industrial control environments.

    The execution modes form a security hierarchy from most restrictive (READ_ONLY)
    to least restrictive (WRITE_ACCESS), allowing fine-grained control over the
    capabilities available to executed code.

class ExecutionControlConfig:
    """Configuration class for control system execution control and security policy management.

    This configuration class encapsulates the security policies and settings that
    determine how Python code execution is controlled within the system. It provides
    the logic for automatically selecting appropriate execution environments based
    on code analysis results and configured security policies.

    The configuration implements a conservative security approach where write
    operations are only permitted when explicitly enabled and detected in the
    code. This ensures that potentially dangerous operations require both
    configuration permission and explicit code intent.

    :param control_system_type: Type of control system (epics, mock, tango, etc.).
        Defaults to mock so an under-specified config never claims a live system.
    :type control_system_type: str

    .. note::
       This configuration should be set based on the deployment environment and
       security requirements. Production control systems should carefully consider
       the implications of enabling write access.

    .. warning::
       Enabling control system writes allows executed code to potentially affect physical
       systems. Ensure appropriate approval workflows and monitoring are in place.

        write access is only granted when both the code requires it and the
        configuration permits it.
