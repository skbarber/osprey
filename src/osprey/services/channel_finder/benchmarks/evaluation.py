"""Channel finder benchmark evaluation.

Stage 1 (always-on) — Programmatic recall check: case-insensitive substring
matching to determine which expected PVs appear anywhere in the agent's
response text. Returns ``(found, missing)``. Cheap, deterministic, no API
call.

Stage 2 (opt-in via ``use_llm_judge=True``) — LLM coverage judge: uses a
small LLM (Haiku via LiteLLM) with structured output to decide which
expected channels the agent's FINAL answer covers — counting both literal
mentions AND unambiguous shorthand (e.g. "all 96 BPMs", "BPM:01 through
BPM:96"). Also returns any channels the agent recommended outside the
expected set, so precision can be measured. Runs whenever the caller opts
in, regardless of whether Stage 1 found everything.

The opt-in default keeps single-paradigm benchmark runs free of upstream
LLM-judge cost; cross-paradigm research that wants shorthand-tolerant
scoring opts in explicitly.

Public API:
    programmatic_recall_check  — stage 1 only
    llm_judge_coverage         — stage 2 only
    evaluate_response          — pipeline (stage 1 default, stage 2 opt-in)
    compute_f1                 — precision / recall / F1 from predicted vs expected
