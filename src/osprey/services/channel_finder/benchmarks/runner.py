"""Benchmark runner for channel finder evaluation.

Runs benchmark queries against a single OSPREY project using the Claude
Agent SDK.  For each query it:
  1. Sends the query via ``run_sdk_query()``
  2. Evaluates the response with ``evaluate_response()`` + ``compute_f1()``
  3. Collects a ``QueryResult``
  4. Aggregates into a ``BenchmarkRun``

Public API:
    BenchmarkRunner  — main orchestrator class

Cross-paradigm matrix orchestration lives in the companion paper repository.
