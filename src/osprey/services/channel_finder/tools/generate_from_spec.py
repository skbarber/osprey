"""Regenerate the shipped tier-3 and tier-1 channel databases from the spec.

This module is the single documented command that regenerates every committed
channel-database artifact. Run in place from the repo root::

    .venv/bin/python -m osprey.services.channel_finder.tools.generate_from_spec

It emits, address-identically, every shipped tier-3 channel-database format --
``hierarchical.json``, ``in_context.json``, ``middle_layer.json`` (under
``src/osprey/templates/apps/control_assistant/data/channel_databases/
tiers/tier3/``) -- from two declarative sources:

* :data:`osprey.simulation.facility_spec.ALS_U_AR` -- the 11 SR-ring
  families and their grown device counts.
* :data:`osprey.simulation.channel_schema.CHANNEL_SCHEMA` -- the FIELD/
  SUBFIELD structure and display metadata for each family.

Address format: ``SR:{system}:{family}:{DD}:{FIELD}:{SUBFIELD}``, where
``DD`` is the zero-padded 2-digit device id. Ring is always ``SR``.

The same invocation also derives ``tiers/tier1/in_context.json`` as a declared
subset of tier 3 (see :data:`TIER1_FILTER` / :func:`apply_tier1_filter`): tier 1
is never authored independently -- it is exactly the tier-1 channels of tier 3.
The tier-1 emission is merge-preserve like tier 3 (existing entries kept
verbatim, filter-selected additions appended), so once tier 1 already equals the
filter of tier 3 the regeneration is a byte-identical no-op.

Merge-preserve semantics
-------------------------
The generator only ever GROWS the 11 FacilitySpec SR ring families
(``SR:MAG:{QF,QD,QFA,DIPOLE,SF,SD,SHF,SHD,HCM,VCM}`` and ``SR:DIAG:BPM``).
Every other address -- BR/BTS rings, ``SR:RF``, ``SR:VAC``,
``SR:DIAG:DCCT``/``GAMMA``/``NEUTRON``, and any other system -- is left
byte-for-byte untouched.

For an address in the target grown inventory that already exists in the
loaded database, the existing entry is kept verbatim (hand-authored prose is
preserved). Only genuinely new addresses -- a new family (QFA/SHF/SHD) or a
device index beyond the loaded count -- are templated from the schema. Once a
family has been grown to its target count, every target address already
exists, so re-running is idempotent (identical bytes).

The three genuinely-new families (QFA, SHF, SHD) have no shipped precedent;
their prose (``in_context.json`` channel/description tokens,
``hierarchical.json`` family-level blurb) is synthesized from the schema
rather than copied from a shipped file, extending the naming convention
established by their structural analog (QF, SF, SD respectively).
