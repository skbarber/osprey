"""Signed session cookies for the auth sidecar.

One browser may hold several unlocked users at once, so a session is not "who am
I" but "which roster users has this browser unlocked, and until when". That set
lives in a single :mod:`itsdangerous`-signed cookie::

    {"v": 1, "sid": "<session id>", "iat": <epoch>, "users": {
        "alice": {"exp": <epoch>, "tag": "0123456789abcdef"}
    }}

**Signed, not encrypted.** Anyone holding the cookie can read the payload; they
just cannot change it. Nothing secret may go in — in particular the stored
password hash never does. Each password-mode entry carries only the
credential-generation tag from :mod:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.passwords`, a
one-way digest the verify endpoint recomputes from the current stored hash so a
rotated password invalidates that user's sessions without server-side state.
OIDC entries carry no tag (there is no stored hash), which is why
:func:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.passwords.verify_generation_tag` refuses an
empty tag: a password-mode session must never authorise without one.

**The codec only signs and verifies.** Cookie attributes — ``SameSite=Lax``,
``HttpOnly`` always, ``Secure`` under TLS — are the caller's to set on the
response; this module never touches a request or response object.

**Fail closed.** Constructing a codec without a signing secret raises rather than
falling back to an unsigned or default-keyed cookie, so a misconfigured sidecar
cannot start and hand out forgeable sessions. Decoding raises
:class:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.exceptions.InvalidSessionError` for a
bad signature, a malformed payload, an
unknown payload version, or a cookie older than the permitted age, and silently
drops entries that have passed their expiry — an expired user is never returned
as unlocked even if a caller forgets to re-check the clock.

Expiries are absolute epoch seconds, matching
:class:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.revocation.RevocationStore`, so a session's
expiry can be passed straight from one to the other.
