"""In-memory revocation list for logged-out session ids.

A session cookie is signed, not stateful: once issued it stays cryptographically
valid until its recorded expiry. Logout therefore needs somewhere to record "this
session id is dead", and the verify endpoint consults that record on every
``auth_request`` subrequest.

**Process-local by design.** The sidecar runs single-process (uvicorn default), so
one dict in that process is the whole store — there is no shared cache to keep
coherent. Two consequences the deployment docs state plainly:

* Anything that recreates the container clears the list. A force-recreate on
  ``osprey users passwd``, a decommission re-render, or a podman image-drift
  reconcile all drop it. A cookie captured before a logout would work again after
  such a restart, bounded by ``auth.session_lifetime``.
* Password rotation does **not** rely on this store. Invalidation there rests on
  the credential-generation tag carried in each unlocked-user entry, which is
  recomputed from the current stored hash on every verify and so survives
  restarts. Revocation covers logout only.

Memory is bounded by logouts-per-session-lifetime, not by container uptime: an
entry is dropped once the clock passes the expiry that was recorded with it,
since a session that has expired is rejected on its own expiry check and no
longer needs a revocation record.
