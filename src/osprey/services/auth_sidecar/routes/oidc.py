"""OIDC login and callback for the auth sidecar.

Two routes under the public ``/auth/`` prefix nginx proxies here:
:data:`LOGIN_PATH` starts the handshake for one roster user and
:data:`CALLBACK_PATH` finishes it. Both exist only when the deployment runs
``auth.method: oidc``; in password mode they answer 404, because the factory
includes every route module regardless of method and "this endpoint is not part
of this deployment" is the honest answer.

**The clicked card is the username.** The landing page offers one card per
roster user, so the login route is addressed per user and the callback's job is
not "who is this person" but "is this person the user whose card was clicked".
The identity the IdP asserts is compared against
:meth:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.app.AuthSettings.oidc_subject` for *that*
user and nothing else: an identity that maps to no roster user, or to a
different one, is refused with 403. Searching the roster for whichever user the
subject happens to match would turn a mis-click into someone else's terminal,
which is exactly the isolation this sidecar exists to establish.

**Which user was clicked is server-side state.** It travels in the pinned
Starlette session cookie (:data:`PENDING_FLOW_SESSION_KEY`) alongside Authlib's
own ``state``/``nonce``, keyed by the same ``state`` value — never as a query
parameter on the ``redirect_uri``, which the browser could edit between the two
legs of the handshake and thereby pick which roster user a successful IdP login
unlocks. The session cookie is signed with the state secret, so its contents are
the sidecar's own word.

**The identity comes from the verified ID token.** Authlib validates the token's
signature, issuer, audience and nonce before
:meth:`authorize_access_token` returns it as ``token["userinfo"]``; this module
reads the configured claim from there and never calls the userinfo endpoint. The
audience is on that list only because :func:`_claims_options` asks for it —
Authlib checks ``aud`` when the caller names it and not otherwise, so removing
that argument would silently reduce the audience check to the OIDC ``azp`` rule.
A deployment whose IdP carries the mapped claim only at that endpoint therefore
locks out with a log line naming the claim, rather than authorising on a second,
weaker trust path.

**Nothing about a failure reaches the browser but its category.** Tokens, claim
values and client secrets never enter a response or a log line; refusals name
the user and the reason class only.
