"""OIDC login and callback for the auth sidecar.

Two routes under the public ``/auth/`` prefix nginx proxies here:
:data:`LOGIN_PATH` starts the handshake for one roster user and
:data:`CALLBACK_PATH` finishes it. Both exist only when the deployment runs
``auth.method: oidc``; in password mode they answer 404, because the factory
includes every route module regardless of method and "this endpoint is not part
of this deployment" is the honest answer.

**The clicked card is the username.** The landing page offers one card per
roster user, so the login route is addressed per user and the callback's job is
not "who is this person" but "is this person the user whose card was clicked".
The identity the IdP asserts is compared against
:meth:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.app.AuthSettings.oidc_subject` for *that*
user and nothing else: an identity that maps to no roster user, or to a
different one, is refused with 403. Searching the roster for whichever user the
subject happens to match would turn a mis-click into someone else's terminal,
which is exactly the isolation this sidecar exists to establish.

**Which user was clicked is server-side state.** It travels in the pinned
Starlette session cookie (:data:`PENDING_FLOW_SESSION_KEY`) alongside Authlib's
own ``state``/``nonce``, keyed by the same ``state`` value — never as a query
parameter on the ``redirect_uri``, which the browser could edit between the two
legs of the handshake and thereby pick which roster user a successful IdP login
unlocks. The session cookie is signed with the state secret, so its contents are
the sidecar's own word.

**The identity comes from the verified ID token.** Authlib validates the token's
signature, issuer, audience and nonce before
:meth:`authorize_access_token` returns it as ``token["userinfo"]``; this module
reads the configured claim from there and never calls the userinfo endpoint. The
audience is on that list only because :func:`_claims_options` asks for it —
Authlib checks ``aud`` when the caller names it and not otherwise, so removing
that argument would silently reduce the audience check to the OIDC ``azp`` rule.
A deployment whose IdP carries the mapped claim only at that endpoint therefore
locks out with a log line naming the claim, rather than authorising on a second,
weaker trust path.

**The role comes from the same token, and only from it.** When the deployment
binds roles to an IdP group claim (:class:`RoleBinding`), the claim is read out
of those already-validated claims — the same ones the identity came from — and
resolved by *intersecting* its values with the configured map. Two rules make
that resolution safe to hand a privilege to: the intersection must name exactly
one distinct role, and anything else fails the login closed under its own
audited category. An empty intersection is "this deployment maps nothing to
what you are in"; more than one distinct role is ambiguity, and picking the
first would make the granted privilege depend on the order the provider
happened to list groups in. A claim that never arrived — Entra's group overage
strips ``groups`` from the ID token and leaves a pointer to Microsoft Graph
behind — is the missing-claim refusal, not a fallback: the userinfo endpoint
this module refuses to call could not have answered it either.

**Nothing about a failure reaches the browser but its category.** Tokens,
client secrets, and the claim values examined while validating a login never
enter a response or a log line; refusals name the user and the reason class
only. The one identity value that is retained is the accepted subject: a
successful login stores it in the (signed, not encrypted) session cookie and
records it on the success log line, because it is an opaque account identifier
rather than a credential and a later verify subrequest reports it back.

    *different* relying party validates as long as it carries an ``azp`` naming
    this client — the OIDC ``azp`` rule is then the only thing standing in the
    way, and an IdP emits ``azp`` at its discretion. Naming ``aud`` makes the
    audience check this deployment's own rather than a side effect of a claim
    that may never arrive.

    **``iss`` is repeated here because this mapping replaces Authlib's default
    rather than extending it.** Omitting it would trade the audience hole for an
    issuer one.

    **The group claim is deliberately absent.** This is a validation contract —
    "these claims must be present and must equal these values" — and a group
    claim has no expected value to check against: naming it here would demand
    every roster user carry the same membership. Its own absence is a decision
    :func:`_resolved_role` makes, with a category and an audit record; Authlib's
    would be an unvalidatable-token 502 that says nothing about roles.

    Both spellings of the issuer are accepted. OIDC Discovery requires the
    published ``issuer`` to equal the prefix its document was fetched from, and
    :func:`_discovery_url` strips one trailing slash off that prefix — so a
    deployment whose configured issuer differs from the IdP's published one by
    exactly that character is correctly configured, and locking it out would be
    this function inventing a requirement neither party has.

    Args:
        settings: The deployment's settings. Both values it reads are
            deployment-wide requirements in OIDC mode, so the configuration
            guard has already refused every request that could reach here
