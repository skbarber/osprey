"""Password-mode login page and credential POST for the auth sidecar.

One public path, :data:`LOGIN_PATH`, under the ``/auth/`` prefix nginx proxies
here: ``GET`` renders the prompt and ``POST`` evaluates the credential. It is
where every denied browser navigation lands — nginx's ``error_page 401`` sends
``/auth/login?user=<name>&next=<path>`` — and it is the only place a
password-mode session comes from.

**The clicked card is the username.** The landing page offers one card per roster
user, so this page is addressed per user and asks for a password and nothing
else. There is no username field: a name typed here could only disagree with the
one the link named, and the page would then either lie about who is being
unlocked or refuse an operator who typed their own name correctly.

**Every method's unauthenticated browser arrives here.** nginx's 401 handler
knows nothing about how this deployment authenticates, so it emits the same
``/auth/login`` redirect under OIDC. A password form is unanswerable there —
there are no passwords to enter — so ``GET`` in OIDC mode redirects onward to
:data:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.routes.oidc.LOGIN_PATH`, carrying the same
user and the same return-to. That path is this module's alone (the OIDC routes
live under ``/auth/oidc/``), so the dispatch has to happen here or nowhere.

**The throttle runs before the credential, never after.** A refused attempt
costs a dict lookup; an evaluated one costs an scrypt derivation. Consulting
:meth:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.throttle.AttemptThrottle.retry_after` first
is what makes parallel guessing throughput-bounded rather than merely delayed,
and it is why a 429 never calls ``record_failure``: counting attempts the
sidecar declined to evaluate would let a flood ratchet the window against the
operator it is supposed to protect.

**Every refusal is the same refusal.** A user with no provisioned credential, a
user who is not on the roster at all, and a wrong password produce one status,
one page, one message, and one identical call into the throttle. What the deny
path deliberately does *not* do is spend an scrypt derivation on a username that
has no stored hash: the roster is public (the landing page lists it), so
equalising that work would buy no secrecy, while turning every POST naming an
invented user into a key derivation an attacker can request without ever meeting
a throttle window. The residual is a timing difference, and it is real —
measured at roughly 32.3 ms for a credentialed roster user against 2.9 ms for an
uncredentialed one and 2.3 ms for a name that is not on the roster. It
distinguishes "this user has a password provisioned" from "this user does not",
which the landing page already discloses, and it is accepted rather than
overlooked.

``GET`` does answer 404 for a user who is not on the roster — the same answer the
OIDC login route gives, and the honest one, since no credential is evaluated
there and nginx only ever generates links for users that exist. Roster
membership is public by design; what must not vary is the answer to *"was that
the right password"*, which is what the POST path holds identical.

**Nothing a client sends is assumed to be small.** nginx will pass through a
return-to as long as a request line allows, and a form field has no bound at
all. Both are capped —
:data:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.return_to.MAX_RETURN_TO_LENGTH` for the
return-to, :data:`MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH` for the name — before either can reach a
``Location`` header, where an over-long value becomes a 502 from the proxy
rather than a login, or the rendered page, where an unauthenticated,
pre-throttle request would otherwise choose the response's size.

**A cross-site POST is not a login.** ``SameSite=Lax`` keeps the session cookie
off cross-site *sub*requests, but it does not stop a browser from storing the
``Set-Cookie`` a top-level cross-site form POST comes back with. Unchecked, a
page anywhere could log an operator into an attacker's roster user — and since a
login *adds* to the unlocked set rather than replacing it, the operator would
keep their own terminals and have no reason to notice which one they are typing
into. So before anything else happens on ``POST``, the submitting origin
(``Origin``, or ``Referer`` where an older browser omits it on a same-origin
form) is compared against this deployment's own, and anything else — including a
request that declares no origin at all — is refused. The refusal is the *same*
400 a malformed form already produces: a distinct status would tell an attacker
exactly which control fired, and same-shaped refusals are this route's whole
deny-path discipline.

**One consequence worth stating for anyone driving this endpoint from a
script**: a POST with neither header is refused, so a test or health probe must
send an ``Origin`` naming the deployment. Real browsers do it unprompted, and a
scripted client has no victim's cookie jar for a minted session to act on, so
nothing legitimate is lost by requiring it.

    """Evaluate one password attempt and, on success, unlock that user.

    The form is read off the request rather than declared as FastAPI ``Form``
    parameters, for the reason the query parameters above are optional: a
    missing or repeated field must produce this route's own refusal, never a 422
    validation body. It also makes the "exactly one value" rule explicit for the
    username, which is the field whose ambiguity would matter.

    Order is load-bearing, twice over. The ``Origin`` check comes before
    everything — a cross-site form must not be able to burn an operator's
    throttle window, let alone reach a credential — and the throttle is consulted
    before the credential is looked at, so a refused attempt costs a dict lookup
    instead of a key derivation and never grows the window. Only an attempt this
    route actually evaluated records a failure.

    On success the user joins — rather than replaces — the browser's unlocked
    set, carrying an expiry stamped from the codec's clock and the
    credential-generation tag of the hash it was checked against. The tag is
    what makes a later ``osprey users passwd`` retire this session: verify
    recomputes it from the *current* stored hash and refuses when they differ.
    The username goes into the entry exactly as submitted, because verify
    exact-matches it against the roster — normalising it here would open the
    chain rather than close it.

    Args:
        request: The inbound request, carrying the submitted form.
        settings: The deployment's frozen settings.
        codec: The app's one session codec, and the one clock every expiry in
            the session path is stamped from.
        throttle: The app's one login-attempt throttle.
        revocations: The app's one revocation store, so a session id logout has
            retired is not carried into the cookie this login issues.

    Returns:
        A 303 to the validated return-to carrying the re-issued session cookie;
        the prompt again with 401 and one fixed message when the credential is
        refused; the prompt with 429 and ``Retry-After`` when the attempt
        arrived inside an open window.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: 400 when the form arrives from another origin or does not
            name exactly one user; 404 when this deployment serves no password
            login.
