"""The ``auth_request`` target: one bare 200 or 401 per protected request.

nginx calls this once for every request under ``/u/<user>/`` — page loads, API
calls, websocket handshakes alike — and turns any non-2xx answer into a denial.
It is therefore on the hot path of the whole deployment and says as little as
possible: an empty 200 or a bare 401, with no body, no redirect and no
``WWW-Authenticate``. Where an unauthenticated browser should be *sent* is
nginx's decision (``error_page 401``, content-negotiated), not this route's; a
redirect issued here would be followed by the subrequest instead of the user.

**The username is a render-time literal.** Each roster user has its own internal
``location = /_osprey_auth/<user>`` whose ``proxy_pass`` carries
``?user=<user>`` baked in at render time, so nothing about the client's request
— path, headers, cookies — selects which identity is being authorized. That is
why this route reads a query parameter and never reconstructs the user from
``$request_uri`` or ``X-Original-URI``: those are attacker-influenceable, and a
path-confusion trick against them would authorize the wrong terminal. A query
carrying the parameter more than once is refused outright rather than resolved,
so the answer can never depend on which of two values a parser happens to pick.

**Every denial looks the same.** An unknown user, an unmapped one, a missing
cookie, a forged cookie and a rotated password all produce the identical bare
401. The reason is recorded at debug level, by category, for the operator
reading the sidecar's log — never the cookie, the generation tag, or the stored
hash. Cookies are signed, not encrypted, so their contents are the caller's
session; nothing about it belongs in a log line.

    All four conditions must hold, and any one of them failing gives the same
    answer:

    1. the request names exactly one roster user;
    2. the session cookie verifies, is not over-age, and is well-formed;
    3. that user is in the cookie's unlocked set and has not passed its expiry;
    4. the session id has not been revoked by a logout;

    plus, in password mode, that the entry's credential-generation tag still
    matches the digest of the user's *current* stored hash. That last check is
    what makes ``osprey users passwd`` take effect immediately: rotating the
    password changes the stored hash, so every session minted against the old
    one stops verifying — without server-side session state, and surviving the
    container recreate that rotation performs (which is also what clears the
    revocation store).

    The parameters are missing-tolerant on purpose. ``user`` defaults to absent
    and the cookie to ``None`` rather than being required, because FastAPI would
    otherwise answer a malformed subrequest with a 422 carrying a validation
    body — a different status and a different shape from every other refusal,
    which is both an information leak and something nginx would surface
    differently.

    ``user`` is read as a *list* so that a repeated parameter is refused rather
    than resolved. A single-valued ``str`` would silently take the first value
    and authorize against it, making the answer depend on which end of
    ``?user=bob&user=alice`` the parser picks. nginx's exact-match ``internal``
    locations cannot produce that query today — the username is a render-time
    literal and the render gate rejects a roster name carrying ``&`` or ``?`` —
    but this endpoint is the deployment's single authorization decision, and it
    should not rest its safety on another layer's invariant holding forever.

    Args:
        settings: The deployment's frozen settings.
        codec: The app's one session codec, which also holds the one clock every
            expiry in the session path is stamped from and checked against.
        revocations: The app's one revocation store, written by logout.
        user: The roster username, supplied by nginx as a render-time literal.
            Exactly one value authorizes; none and several are both refused.
        session_cookie: The signed session cookie, if the browser sent one.

    Returns:
        An empty 200 when the request is authorized, a bare 401 otherwise.
