"""The ``auth_request`` target: one bare 200 or 401 per protected request.

nginx calls this once for every request under ``/u/<user>/`` — page loads, API
calls, websocket handshakes alike — and turns any non-2xx answer into a denial.
It is therefore on the hot path of the whole deployment and says as little as
possible: a bodyless 200 or a bare 401, with no redirect and no
``WWW-Authenticate``. The only things an authorized answer may carry are the
four identity headers of
:mod:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.identity_headers` — the roster card the
request is on, who proved the login, the role that holds and where the role
came from, all opaque identifiers and never a credential. The card rides every
authorized answer, because an authorized request always has one; the other
three ride only when the session holds them.
Where an unauthenticated browser should be *sent* is
nginx's decision (``error_page 401``, content-negotiated), not this route's; a
redirect issued here would be followed by the subrequest instead of the user.

**The username is a render-time literal.** Each roster user has its own internal
``location = /_osprey_auth/<user>`` whose ``proxy_pass`` carries
``?user=<user>`` baked in at render time, so nothing about the client's request
— path, headers, cookies — selects which identity is being authorized. That is
why this route reads a query parameter and never reconstructs the user from
``$request_uri`` or ``X-Original-URI``: those are attacker-influenceable, and a
path-confusion trick against them would authorize the wrong terminal. A query
carrying the parameter more than once is refused outright rather than resolved,
so the answer can never depend on which of two values a parser happens to pick.

**Every denial looks the same.** An unknown user, an unmapped one, a missing
cookie, a forged cookie and a rotated password all produce the identical bare
401. The reason is recorded at debug level, by category, for the operator
reading the sidecar's log — never the cookie, the generation tag, or the stored
hash. Cookies are signed, not encrypted, so their contents are the caller's
session; nothing about it belongs in a log line.

    All four conditions must hold, and any one of them failing gives the same
    answer:

    1. the request names exactly one roster user;
    2. the session cookie verifies, is not over-age, and is well-formed;
    3. that user is in the cookie's unlocked set and has not passed its expiry;
    4. the session id has not been revoked by a logout;

    plus, in password mode, that the entry's credential-generation tag still
    matches the digest of the user's *current* stored hash. That last check is
    what makes ``osprey users passwd`` take effect immediately: rotating the
    password changes the stored hash, so every session minted against the old
    one stops verifying — without server-side session state, and surviving the
    container recreate that rotation performs (which is also what clears the
    revocation store).

    The parameters are missing-tolerant on purpose. ``user`` defaults to absent
    and the cookie to ``None`` rather than being required, because FastAPI would
    otherwise answer a malformed subrequest with a 422 carrying a validation
    body — a different status and a different shape from every other refusal,
    which is both an information leak and something nginx would surface
    differently.

    ``user`` is read as a *list* so that a repeated parameter is refused rather
    than resolved. A single-valued ``str`` would silently take the first value
    and authorize against it, making the answer depend on which end of
    ``?user=bob&user=alice`` the parser picks. nginx's exact-match ``internal``
    locations cannot produce that query today — the username is a render-time
    literal and the render gate rejects a roster name carrying ``&`` or ``?`` —
    but this endpoint is the deployment's single authorization decision, and it
    should not rest its safety on another layer's invariant holding forever.

    Args:
        settings: The deployment's frozen settings.

        revocations: The app's one revocation store, written by logout.
        user: The roster username, supplied by nginx as a render-time literal.
            Exactly one value authorizes; none and several are both refused.
        session_cookie: The signed session cookie, if the browser sent one.

    Returns:
        An empty 200 when the request is authorized, a bare 401 otherwise. An
        authorized answer additionally carries the identity headers — always the
        roster card the request is on, plus whichever of the login's subject,

    """The bare 200, carrying the account and whatever else the session can fill.

    ``is_unlocked`` has already established that ``entry`` exists, so ``None`` is
    only a defensive guard.

    Four headers may ride the 200. ``X-Osprey-Auth-Account`` names the roster
    card the request is on — the username this subrequest authorized, which a
    consumer can compare against the account it believes it is serving.
    ``X-Osprey-Auth-Subject`` names who proved the login — the provider subject
    under OIDC, the roster username otherwise — so a later layer can tell who is
    behind the request without re-reading the cookie. The two coincide in
    password mode and diverge on a shared card under OIDC, which is the case
    they exist separately for. ``X-Osprey-Auth-Role`` names the role that
    account holds.

    **The account is the one header that always rides.** An authorized request
    is by definition on a card, so there is no session state that can leave it
    empty; the other three are *omitted* rather than emitted empty when the
    session has nothing to put in them, so a present header always means a known
    value and no consumer has to tell blank from absent: presence of the subject
    means a known login, and absence of the role means no privileges. An
    authorized answer with no account header therefore means a sidecar older
    than this release, not a request without an account.

    **The role is the one the login granted, not the roster's current answer.**
    It is read off the session and never re-derived here, so a retired role
    lapses with the session rather than at the moment the config is edited: an
    operator who removes a ``role:`` (or an OIDC claim binding) takes it away
    from the next login, while sessions already outstanding keep carrying it
    until they expire or are revoked. Deliberate — re-deriving on every
    subrequest would turn a config edit into a live privilege change on browsers
    mid-session, and it would put a second reading of the identity matrix on the
    hot path. If retiring a role must retire outstanding sessions too, the
    generation tag is the mechanism to copy: it already revokes on a credential
    change, and it does so by invalidating the session rather than by rewriting
    what it says.

    **A changed METHOD is a different question, and it does not lapse.** The
    paragraph above is about a role that is no longer *granted*; switching
    ``auth.method`` from ``password`` to ``oidc`` is about a proof this
    deployment no longer *accepts*. The signing secret survives a re-render, so
    those password cookies stay readable, and under ``oidc`` the generation-tag
    check that a password rotation would have tripped is skipped. Both halves of
    the identity therefore go through the matrix rather than off the entry:
    :func:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.routes.recheck.session_subject` already
    named nobody for such a session, and
    :func:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.routes.recheck.session_role` now grants
    it no role either.

    **The source rides only beside the role.** ``X-Osprey-Auth-Role-Source``
    names which authority resolved the role in the header above it — ``roster``
    for the entry the render bound, ``claim`` for a validated ID token — and it
    comes from the same matrix rather than off the entry, so it is absent on
    every path the role is absent from: a session holding no role has no
    provenance to explain. Unlike the role, it is display only: it says where a
    privilege came from and confers none of its own.

    **An uncarryable value denies.** Every value is checked against
    :func:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.identity_headers.is_header_safe` even
    though the session codec refuses to store one that fails — the roster
    username reaches here without passing through the codec at all, so a
    deployment rendered past its lint with a non-ASCII username would otherwise
    have its identity mangled across the boundary or fail the response encoding
    on the hot path. Denying instead is the closed answer, and it is the same
    bare 401 as every other refusal.
