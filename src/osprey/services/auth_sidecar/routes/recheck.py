"""The login re-check: one identity matrix, enforced in one place.

Every route in this service that mints a session first asks the same question —
*given how this browser proved who it is, what is that proof worth?* — and the
answer is a table, not a judgement call. This module is that table. It is the
only place that maps an auth method onto the ``(subject, role, role_source)`` a
session may carry, so a row cannot be admitted by the password path and refused
by the OIDC one, and a method nobody wrote a row for cannot fall through into a
plausible reading of itself.

The matrix, one row per posture:

===================  =====================================  =====================  ==========
method               subject                                role                   source
===================  =====================================  =====================  ==========
``none``             — (no session is minted)               — (no login events)    — (none)
``password``         the roster username                    the roster ``role:``   ``roster``
``oidc``, unbound    the asserted IdP subject               the roster ``role:``   ``roster``
``oidc``, bound      the asserted IdP subject               the claim's role,      ``claim``
                                                            cross-checked
                                                            against the roster's
anything else        refused at mint; verify names the      — (refused)            — (refused)
                     locally verified identity
===================  =====================================  =====================  ==========

**The source says which of those two authorities the role came from**, and
nothing more. It is :data:`ROLE_SOURCE_ROSTER` when the role is the one the
render bound and :data:`ROLE_SOURCE_CLAIM` when a validated ID token decided it,
and it is empty exactly when the role is — a session holding no role has no
provenance to explain. Provenance is not privilege: nothing in this service
decides anything from it, it only lets the far end say where the role it is
already showing came from.

**The last row's two halves dispose of it differently, which is why it is the
one row the table qualifies.** :func:`recheck_login` refuses an unsupported
method outright, so no session can ever be minted under one — that half is
absolute. :func:`session_subject` does not re-check the closed set: it reads a
session that already exists, and the only way to reach it under an unsupported
method is a *method change* made under an outstanding cookie. There the honest
answer is the identity this service verified locally, not a second refusal of a
login that already happened. Nothing widens — the row still mints nothing.

**The ``none`` row is somebody else's.** A deployment with no login method runs
no sidecar: the identity a single-user install acts under comes from
:func:`osprey.utils.identity.acting_identity`, its role is whatever its render
pinned, and there is no login event to record because there is no login. The row
is in the table so that the method reaching this service *anyway* — a
half-rendered compose file, a typo, a value a future release adds — is refused
by a rule rather than by whichever branch happened to be written last.

**The role a login carries must be the role its terminal was built as.** A
roster entry's ``role:`` is not a second opinion about privilege — it is what
the *render* resolved this user's persona from, so it already decided which
container the login lands in. The matrix therefore reads it under every method
that mints a session:

* Under ``password`` it is the whole answer. The entry names a role, the render
  built that user's terminal from the persona it resolves to, and no third party
  is involved.
* Under ``oidc`` with **no** claim binding it is still the answer. The provider
  proves *who* this is; nothing in the deployment asked it about privilege, so
  the role is the one the deployment itself bound at render time.
* Under ``oidc`` **with** a claim binding it becomes the cross-check target. The
  validated ID token decides the role, and it must be the role the roster named
  for the user whose card was clicked — otherwise the session would say one role
  while sitting in another's container. A disagreement is refused
  (:data:`~osprey.services.auth_sidecar.audit.REASON_ROLE_MISMATCH`), and
  refusing grants nothing: it turns away a login whose asserted privilege does
  not match the terminal behind the door.

**The one gap, stated rather than papered over.** A roster entry that names no
role — a ``persona:`` pin, or an entry riding the default persona — gives the
cross-check nothing to compare against. Its container is not role-bound at all,
so there is no rendered role for the claim to disagree with, and the claim's
role is what the session carries. That is the honest reading: the deployment
declined to bind this entry to a role, and the only authority left is the one
that did.

**Anti-lookup.** Nothing here searches. Every resolution is keyed by the
username whose card was clicked — :meth:`RosterRoles.role_for` is a mapping
lookup, and the OIDC subject comparison is against *that* user's mapped subject
and no other. There is deliberately no helper answering "which user holds this
role" or "which user does this identity belong to": a mis-click must end in a
refusal, never in somebody else's terminal. Pinned structurally rather than by
spelling: :data:`__all__` declares the whole public surface and a test asserts
it equals what the module defines, so a reverse lookup cannot arrive under a
name nobody predicted.
