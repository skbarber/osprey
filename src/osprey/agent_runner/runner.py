"""Headless agent-run entry point for the ``osprey query`` CLI command.

Provides a production-ready ``run_query`` coroutine built on the shared
primitives in ``osprey.agent_runner.primitives``.  ``run_query`` is the
single-turn entry point; the multi-turn counterpart is
``osprey.agent_runner.session.agent_session``.  Both build their SDK options
via ``primitives.build_agent_options`` and parse the response stream via
``primitives._drain_response``, so provider routing and message handling are
identical across them.

The module remains importable when ``claude_agent_sdk`` is absent; the runtime
path will raise ``ImportError`` in that case, but module-level imports (e.g.
for type checking or CLI argument parsing) still succeed.

    """Run a single-turn, read-only agent query via the Claude Agent SDK.

    This is the production runner used by ``osprey query``.  It is
    architecturally read-only: the caller supplies ``disallowed_tools`` which
    the SDK forwards to the Claude Code CLI as ``--disallowedTools``, blocking
    writes even under ``permission_mode=bypassPermissions``.

    The function polls ``await_mcp_ready`` before sending the prompt so the
    agent always starts with a fully registered toolset — eliminating the
    controls cold-start race described in ``primitives.await_mcp_ready``.

    Args:
        project_dir: Path to an initialized OSPREY project.
        prompt: The user prompt to send to the agent.
        disallowed_tools: Tool names forbidden at the SDK level.  This is the
            architectural read-only guard; the caller is responsible for
            supplying the appropriate list (see
            ``.claude/hooks/hook_config.json`` ``write_tools``).
        max_turns: Maximum agentic turns before stopping.
        max_budget_usd: Budget cap in USD (not scaled — this is the literal
            ceiling passed to the SDK).
        model: Model identifier.  When ``None``, resolved from the project's
            ``config.yml`` haiku-tier entry via ``resolve_default_model``.

    Returns:
        SDKWorkflowResult with all collected tool traces, text blocks,
        system messages, MCP server snapshot, and the final ResultMessage.

    Raises:
        ImportError: When ``claude_agent_sdk`` is not installed.
        RuntimeError: When the underlying SDK query fails.
