"""Read-only resolution of a dispatch run's artifacts to renderable bytes.

Generic OSPREY-core capability: given a headless dispatch ``run_id``, discover
the artifacts the run produced (via the artifact store's write-time ``run_id``
tag — ``ArtifactStore.list_entries(run_filter=...)`` / ``get_run_entry``) and
resolve each to a file on disk that an external caller can fetch as image/PDF
bytes.

Association is **created-by, not referenced-by**: a run owns exactly the
artifacts it *wrote* (tagged from ``OSPREY_DISPATCH_RUN_ID`` at save time),
never merely the ones its tool-call results happen to mention. Authorization
therefore never reads agent-controllable data, so a prompt-injected run cannot
widen its own artifact set or reach another run's bytes.

Resolution rules per artifact MIME type:
  * ``image/*`` and ``application/pdf`` — passthrough, served as-is.
  * HTML / Markdown / notebook / JSON / text — converted to PNG via the shared
    converter registry, and the temp PNG path is returned.
  * If the converter or one of its runtime dependencies (e.g. Playwright) is
    unavailable, the original file is returned with ``convertible=False`` rather
    than failing the whole call.

Depends only on ``osprey.stores`` (artifact index/files) and the artifact
converter registry (``osprey.mcp_server.ariel.converters``). It deliberately
does NOT import the ARIEL FastMCP server, so it is safe to import and call from
the dispatch worker without coupling the worker to that server.
