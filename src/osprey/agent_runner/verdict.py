"""Exit-code verdict for a completed SDK query run.

Translates the structured ``SDKWorkflowResult`` into one of two exit codes:

* ``EXIT_PASS`` (0) — all expected MCP servers are connected, the run
  completed without error, and no budget or turn-limit was exceeded.
* ``EXIT_VERDICT_FAIL`` (1) — any of those conditions is not met.

The third constant, ``EXIT_USAGE`` (2), is reserved for the CLI layer to
report infrastructure or usage errors that prevented the run from starting at
all.  It lives here so callers can import all three constants from a single
module.
