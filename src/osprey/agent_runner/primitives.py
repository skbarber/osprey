# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MCP readiness barrier + instrumentation
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# OSPREY MCP servers register ASYNCHRONOUSLY: the controls stdio subprocess does
# heavyweight cold-start work (config prime, connector registration, tool-module
# imports) and only finishes its MCP handshake ~1–1.5s after the CLI launches —
# noticeably slower than the python/osprey_workspace servers. If the agent's first
# turn fires before that handshake completes, the controls tools are simply not in
# its toolset, and a less-persistent agent reports "no controls server connected"
# and gives up. That is a cold-start race, NOT a model capability gap — yet it is
# scored as a failure, and it cannot be distinguished from a genuine model give-up
# from the persisted transcript (which does not record MCP status).
#
# Both problems are solved with the SDK's own ``ClaudeSDKClient.get_mcp_status()``:
#   * READINESS — poll it until the expected servers are ``connected`` before sending
#     the prompt, so every agent gets a ready toolset (the harness-enforced equivalent
#     of the CLI's ``WaitForMcpServers`` tool, independent of whether the model thinks
#     to call it).
#   * INSTRUMENTATION — persist the final snapshot so a missing tool is provably INFRA
#     (server never registered) vs MODEL (tool was there, agent ignored it).

# The default ceiling generously covers the measured ~1.5s controls cold start with
# headroom for a loaded box. Overridable via env for slow CI hosts.
