"""Multi-turn agent conversations over the Claude Agent SDK.

``osprey.agent_runner.runner.run_query`` sends one prompt and closes the
session.  Some callers need to hold a session open and choose each message from
the agent's previous reply — an operator-style evaluation, an adaptive
red-team loop, or a benchmark that branches on what the agent answered.

:class:`AgentSession` provides that: a handle over one persistent SDK client
that sends a single user turn at a time, accumulating transcript and cost and
enforcing a session-wide budget.  Open one for a project with
:func:`agent_session`; for the simple case of a fixed, pre-decided script use
:func:`run_turns`.  Both reuse the same provider-routing and stream-parsing as
``run_query`` (via ``primitives.build_agent_options`` / ``_drain_response``).

Cost accounting: the SDK reports ``ResultMessage.total_cost_usd`` as the
cumulative session cost to date — the field is a running ``total_`` and the SDK
documents its usage counters as cumulative for the session.  A turn's
incremental cost is therefore the delta from the previous turn's total, and the
session total is the latest turn's ``total_cost_usd``.  The session budget is
enforced from that cumulative figure and is also passed to the SDK as a
backstop.
