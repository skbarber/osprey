"""Write-tool list loader for the OSPREY headless agent runner.

Provides a single entry point, ``load_write_tools``, that returns the list of
MCP tool names subject to the writes kill switch.  The list is read from the
project's generated ``hook_config.json``; on any failure the module falls back
to a replica of the canonical list in
``templates/claude_code/claude/hooks/osprey_writes_check.py`` so the runner
always fail-closes (i.e. never accidentally omits a gated tool).

    Framework servers are covered by :func:`_registry_side_effect_tools`, but a

    servers whose write tools never reach ``hook_config.json`` ``write_tools``
    (only writes-check-gated matchers do) and are invisible to the static
    registry walk. The documented pattern marks them with ``permissions.ask``::

        claude_code:

              hooks: {pre_tool_use: [approval]}

    So for each enabled custom server this emits ``mcp__<server>__<tool>`` for
    every ``permissions.ask`` tool (exact, preserving the server's reads). If a
    custom server writes-check-gates *all* its tools (``pre_tool_use:
    [writes_check]``), it is blocked server-level (``mcp__<server>``) — the
    facility marked the whole server write-gated, and the per-tool regex matcher
    the registry would emit (``mcp__<server>__.*``) is a no-op in the SDK's

    ``.mcp.json`` from a previous build can still launch the server
    (``enableAllProjectMcpServers: true``), so an unresolvable spec must block
