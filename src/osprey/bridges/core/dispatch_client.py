"""HTTP client for the OSPREY dispatch pipeline.

The full sequence:

  1. ``POST {dispatcher}/webhook/{trigger}`` (Bearer EVENT_DISPATCHER_TOKEN,
     question in the JSON body)  ->  202 ``{"dispatch_id": ...}``.
  2. Poll ``GET {dispatcher}/dispatch/{dispatch_id}`` until the dispatcher reports
     ``status == "completed"`` and hands back a ``run_id`` in ``result``. NOTE:
     the dispatcher's "completed" is only the 202 handshake — it means the run was
     *accepted* by the worker, NOT that the agent finished.
  3. Poll ``GET {worker}/dispatch/{run_id}`` (Bearer DISPATCH_WORKER_TOKEN) until
     the *worker* reports ``status in {completed, error}``. This is the real
     terminal state, carrying ``text_output`` / ``error``.

Returns
``{"status", "text_output", "run_id", "error", "artifacts", "input_artifacts",
"failure_class", "num_tool_calls", "error_code"}``.
``error_code`` is the dispatcher's structured pool-error code, surfaced onto the
result when the dispatcher rejected the request with one (e.g.
``input_files_cap_exceeded`` / ``input_files_invalid``); ``None`` otherwise. The
retry policy reads it to force such a rejection non-retryable.
``artifacts`` is the run-status body's artifact field, passed through verbatim:
a current worker returns a list of **descriptor dicts**
(``{"artifact_id", "filename", "source_mime", "delivered_mime", "convertible"}``);
an older worker (during the deploy window) returns bare id strings. Either shape
is normalized downstream by :func:`osprey.bridges.core.artifacts.artifact_ids`
(to ids) or :func:`osprey.bridges.core.artifacts.artifact_descriptors` (to whole
descriptors). ``delivered_mime`` is what the worker *predicted* it would serve,
not what a fetch returns — see that module on why delivery routes on the served
Content-Type instead.
``[]`` when there are no artifacts or the worker predates the field.
``input_artifacts`` is the run-status body's list of inbound files the worker
ingested for this run (``[{entry_id, filename, mime}]``), passed through
verbatim; ``[]`` when there were none or the worker predates the field. The
bridge records these as ``origin="input"`` history descriptors — they are never
republished, so unlike output ``artifacts`` they never carry a public URL.

``failure_class`` / ``num_tool_calls`` are the worker's run-classification
fields, passed through from the run-status body. They drive the retry policy
(is this run worth re-dispatching, and did the agent get far enough to matter).
Both are ``None`` when **UNKNOWN** — an older worker that predates the fields
omits them, and ``.get`` yields ``None``, never ``0``. Bridge-local error
results (transport/handshake/poll-budget failures synthesized without ever
reaching a worker terminal state) default ``failure_class="infrastructure"``
and ``num_tool_calls=None``. Every consumer reads these with ``.get`` so an
older worker skew (worker deployed before this field lands) degrades to
UNKNOWN rather than breaking.

Connection behavior is the deployment's to decide: the default client is built
with ``trust_env=cfg.trust_env`` (default ``False``), so by default it ignores
``HTTP(S)_PROXY`` and reaches the dispatcher and the worker directly — the same
rule :mod:`osprey.bridges.core.health_gate` and
:mod:`osprey.bridges.core.capabilities` follow. A site whose bridge sits behind
an egress proxy sets ``trust_env`` true once, in config. Tests inject their own
:class:`httpx.MockTransport` client.

Like every ``osprey.bridges.core`` module this carries ZERO osprey dispatch
imports.
