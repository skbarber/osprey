"""Fetch agent-generated artifacts from the dispatch worker.

This is the channel-agnostic *fetch* half of artifact delivery: given a run and
an artifact id, pull the bytes over the worker's authenticated byte route and
apply the size guard. What a channel then DOES with those bytes — republish them
as a public object for an image widget, attach them as MIME parts, share them
over WebDAV — stays in the channel package.

A run's ``artifacts`` descriptors are a *prediction*, written when the run
completes: they promise ``delivered_mime: image/png`` for everything the worker
intends to render, but whether the render happens is only known at fetch time
(a converter dependency can be missing, a renderer can crash), and the byte
route then serves the original bytes under their real Content-Type. So a
descriptor may name and label an artifact, and must never decide what it *is*:
:class:`FetchedArtifact` carries the two facts that cannot lie — the bytes
(``is_png``) and the Content-Type the worker served them under. Routing on the
prediction instead loses artifacts silently (osprey #503).

``artifact_ids`` and ``artifact_descriptors`` normalize the run-status body's
``artifacts`` field (osprey #363 descriptor dicts, or bare id strings from an
older worker) to ids and to descriptor dicts respectively.

Nothing here raises to the caller: a fetch failure must degrade to fewer (or
zero) attachments, never break the text answer. NO channel imports, NO osprey
dispatch imports.
