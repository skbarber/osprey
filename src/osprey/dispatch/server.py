"""Event dispatcher FastMCP server.

Loads triggers from triggers.yml, wires trigger sources → dispatch pool →
dispatch worker client, and exposes MCP tools plus a dashboard for inspection.

The server uses a two-phase startup that respects FastMCP's route-timing rule:
``create_server()`` (factory time) registers ALL routes — dashboard routes plus
the webhook routes owned by :class:`~osprey.dispatch.source_registry.SourceRegistry`
— before the ASGI app is built, while ``_dispatch_lifespan`` (lifespan time, with a
running event loop) registers triggers into the registry and starts the sources.
