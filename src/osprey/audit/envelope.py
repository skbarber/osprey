"""The unified audit envelope — one record shape for every safety decision.

Osprey's P1/P2 work left two separate refusal ledgers, each with its own ad-hoc
record shape: ``readonly-refusals.jsonl`` (the python executor) and
``protected-writes.jsonl`` (the framework writers). Neither could answer the
question an operator actually asks — *who did what, under which posture, as
which role* — because neither carried the actor, the posture, or the session
that governed the decision.

This module defines the single envelope that replaces both, and that MCP tool
calls, HTTP mutations, hook decisions and logins all emit:

``{ts, surface, actor, posture, posture_source, session, subject, decision,
reason, detail?, role?, source?}``

**What may go in an envelope.** Every field carries an *identifier* or a
*config key* — a surface name, a username, a tool name, a dotted config key, a
short machine-ish reason. No field ever carries a config **value**, a prompt,
an agent message, a credential, or any other payload the record is merely
*about*. The one deliberate exception is :attr:`AuditEnvelope.source` on the
executor surface, where the refused code *is* the artifact under audit and a
record without it would be an alert rather than an audit trail; that field is
therefore refused on every other surface (:data:`SURFACE_EXECUTOR`).

**Provenance is stated, never inferred.** :attr:`~AuditEnvelope.posture_source`
is a closed set (:data:`POSTURE_SOURCES`) that says *how* the posture in the
record was established — a spawn-time env marker, a live toggle, an app-side
constant, or bare process context. It is passed explicitly by the caller and
validated here; deriving it from the posture *value* would turn an honest
"we do not know why" into a confident guess.

**Bounded by construction.** Every string field is bounded (see the ``MAX_*``
constants) and the bounding happens in :meth:`AuditEnvelope.__post_init__`, so
there is no way to build an unbounded envelope and no bound the writer has to
re-apply. ``detail`` is truncated silently; ``source`` is truncated *and*
flagged via :attr:`~AuditEnvelope.source_truncated`, because a truncated script
that did not say so would read like the whole script.

This module is **schema only** — it writes nothing. The writer that turns an
envelope into a line of ``var/audit/<identity>/<surface>.jsonl`` lives beside
it in ``osprey.audit.writer``. Like ``osprey.utils.sensitive_env``, it stays a
stdlib-only leaf: the writer, the MCP middleware, the HTTP layer and the hooks
all import it, and none of them may inherit an import cycle by doing so.

    both bare strings and a transposed pair would be silently plausible.

    Validation and bounding happen in :meth:`__post_init__`, which is what
    makes this type the schema: every constructed envelope is already legal and
    already bounded, and the writer never has to second-guess one.

    :param surface: Which surface decided — ``executor``, ``setup_patch``,
        ``http_config``, ``scaffold_restore``, an MCP server name, and so on.
        Kept verbatim even when the writer routes the record elsewhere (the
        maintenance-phase marker), so the record still says who decided.
    :param actor: Whose action it was, from ``identity.acting_identity()``.
    :param posture: The session's true posture at decision time — ``sandbox``
        or ``writes`` as the rest of Osprey spells them.
    :param posture_source: How *posture* was established; one of
        :data:`POSTURE_SOURCES`. Explicit, never derived from *posture*.
    :param session: The posture-store key that governed this record — the chat
        id for chat children, the spawn-time key for PTY sessions. ``None``
        only where no posture-store key exists; *posture_source* already says
        why. A top-level field, never smuggled into *detail*, so toggle events
        and tool records join on one key.
    :param subject: What was acted on — an MCP tool name, a dotted config key,
        a project-relative path, a login subject. An identifier, never a value.
    :param decision: What happened; see :data:`DECISIONS`.
    :param reason: Short machine-ish reason (``protected_key``,
        ``posture``, ``role_mismatch``).
    :param detail: Optional supplementary context, bounded to
        :data:`MAX_DETAIL_CHARS`. Identifiers and config keys only — never a
        config value, a prompt, or an agent message.
    :param role: The role the actor held, where the decision was identity-bound.
    :param source: The offending code, on :data:`SURFACE_EXECUTOR` only.
        Bounded to :data:`MAX_SOURCE_CHARS`; a :class:`ValueError` on any other
        surface, which is the schema's guard against payload leaking into the
        ledger.
    :param ts: Record timestamp; defaults to :func:`utc_timestamp`.
    :raises ValueError: on an unknown *posture_source*, an empty required
        field, or *source* outside the executor surface. Emitters call this
        from inside the writer's own never-raises boundary, so a construction
