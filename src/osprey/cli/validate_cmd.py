"""The ``osprey validate`` verb — check a deployment's source without building.

Validation is the cheap half of a build: resolve the ``extends:`` chain, check
the convention directories, the ``data:`` tree, service templates, lifecycle
steps and env vars, then lint the web stack against the config a build would
render. Nothing is written and nothing is started, which is what makes this the
verb a CI pipeline runs first and an operator runs after every profile edit.

Zero-argument is the normal spelling: the repo enclosing the working directory
is the thing being validated, found by the same walk every repo-scoped command
uses. The optional path argument stays for the one profile that is not a repo
root — a persona delta under ``personas/``, which is a profile in its own right
and has its own way to be wrong.

``osprey profile validate`` is the same verb spelled as part of the ``profile``
noun group, and both spellings are documented surface. Only the INTERFACE
differs — a required TARGET there, an optional one plus ``--repo`` here — so the
check itself lives once, in :func:`check_profile_file`, and both commands
resolve a profile file and hand it over. The two used to be copy-pasted bodies
and had already drifted into two failure headers, two next-step lines and two
wordings of the same refusal.

    The host-variant overlay is applied first, exactly as ``osprey build``
    applies it. Without that, this verb would judge a document no host builds:
    a repo whose ``.env.variant`` selects ``profiles/teststand.yml`` would be
    called valid on the strength of the tracked profile while the render the
    build produces is the merged one — and the operator would find out at build
