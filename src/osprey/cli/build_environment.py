    One venv, one install command, one resolver pass. The resolver sees all

    either succeeds or fails.

    The interpreter the venv is based on comes from
    ``profile.environment.python`` when set, and from the build's own
    interpreter otherwise. A bare-interpreter base and a venv-interpreter base
    take the identical path — a venv's python *is* an interpreter — so nothing
    here branches on venv-ness. Basing the venv on another venv's interpreter
    does **not** inherit that venv's installed packages; only the requirements
    assembled here are installed. :func:`freeze_base_environment` is what turns
    a declared venv base's packages into such requirements, so a declared base
    is carried over deliberately, as pins, rather than by inheritance.

    The same assembled list is installed here, recorded by
    :func:`_write_project_pyproject`, and returned to the caller, which renders
    it into the generated Dockerfile's install line. Three consumers, one list:
    the host venv, its record, and the image built from it cannot disagree
    about what the project depends on, because none of them re-derives it.

    interpreted.
