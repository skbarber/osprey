"""Knowledge CLI commands for OSPREY Facility Knowledge (OKF).

Provides operations on OKF bundle directories: index regeneration,
validation, and seed-from-ontology (the latter added by later tasks).

Note: this module is intentionally importable WITHOUT the ``knowledge``
extra (rdflib) installed.  Any rdflib usage must be guarded by a lazy
import inside the command body.
