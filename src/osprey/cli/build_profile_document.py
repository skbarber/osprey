"""Raw profile-YAML document reads — the single parse + alias-normalization point.

Every layer of the profile pipeline reads its YAML through
:func:`_read_profile_document`: the bundled preset, each ``-O`` override file,
the ``extends:`` parent inside :func:`~osprey.cli.build_profile_merge._resolve_extends`,
the positional profile file, and the hashing path. Normalizing there rather than
at the call sites means a YAML-surface spelling is translated to its canonical
field name exactly once per document, so only one spelling ever survives a
layer — which is what lets mixed-spelling ``extends:`` and override chains merge
child-wins through the ordinary deep merge, and what scopes the
"both spellings, different values" error to a single authored document.

Kept a leaf — it imports nothing else from the profile pipeline — so
:mod:`osprey.cli.build_profile_presets` can use it without gaining a dependency
on the parser.
