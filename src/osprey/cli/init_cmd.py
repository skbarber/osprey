"""``osprey init`` — create the deployment repo.

This is the one way an OSPREY deployment comes into existence. It writes a git
repository that is the deployment: one directory, four zones.

    als-assistant/
    │  ═ SOURCE — tracked, user-edited ═══════════════
    ├── profile.yml  triggers.yml  README.md
    ├── data/  personas/  web-terminal-context/

The source zone is materialized by the same machinery every other
materialization path uses (:func:`~.profile_cmd._materialize_profile_directory`,
in its repo-root layout). What this module adds is the repo around it: the
anchored four-zone ``.gitignore``, the README explaining the zones, the state
skeleton, the CI emission, and the initial commit.

Usage::

    osprey init                              # in-place, into an empty directory
    osprey init als-assistant --preset control-assistant
    osprey init demo --preset control-assistant --up -d --dev

# {name}

This folder is your OSPREY assistant. Everything it is made of lives here, and
the folder name is the assistant's name.

## What is in here

| What | Where | In git? | Kept? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Your settings | `profile.yml`, `data/`, `personas/` | yes | yes |
| Your API keys | `.env` | no | yes |
| Generated files | `{BUILD_OUTPUT_DIR}/` | no | no, safe to delete |
| The agent's memory and audit log | `{STATE_DIR}/agent_data/`, `{STATE_DIR}/audit/` | no | yes |

In full, the first row is: {_source_zone_prose()}.

`{BUILD_OUTPUT_DIR}/` is generated from your settings every time you run `osprey build`.
Deleting it is always safe: no settings, no keys and no agent memory live there.

## The `.env` files

Two of these are yours to edit, one is documentation, and anything else
starting with `.env` is generated by a deploy — kept out of git, and never
edited by hand.

| File | What it is for | In git? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{ENV_SHARED_FILENAME}` | edit — the settings that are the same on every host | yes |
| `.env` | edit — this host's own values, and every key | no |
| `.env.example` | documentation — every variable this deployment reads | yes |
| `.env.merged` | generated — the settings a deploy hands the containers | no |

`{ENV_SHARED_FILENAME}` and `.env` are read together, `.env` last: if the same
setting appears in both, the one in `.env` wins. That is how a single host
changes a shared default without affecting anyone else. None of these files go
into a container image — they are all read when the deployment starts.

`{MERGED_COMPOSE_FILENAME}` at the root is generated the same way, so a deploy
can hand the container runtime one file instead of several. It is kept out of
git, holds no keys, is rewritten by every `osprey up`, and `osprey reset`
removes it.

## Everyday commands

```bash
osprey build          # turn your settings into something runnable
osprey up -d          # start it in the background
osprey status         # what is running, and is it up to date
osprey logs           # watch the logs
osprey down           # stop it
```

Run these from anywhere inside this folder. They find their way to the top on
their own, so they need no arguments. `--repo PATH` points them somewhere else.

## Changing something

Edit `profile.yml` (or run `osprey set model=sonnet` to change one setting),
then:

```bash
osprey build && osprey up -d
```

`osprey up` starts what `osprey build` last produced. If you change your
settings without rebuilding, `up` stops and tells you what changed, so a
half-finished edit cannot reach a running system. `osprey up --build` does both
steps; `osprey up --as-built` starts the previous build anyway.

## Running it on a server

To run this somewhere other than your own machine, fill in the `deploy:` section
at the end of `profile.yml` (which server, which CI system), then run:

```bash
osprey scaffold ci
```

That writes the pipeline files. Your own extra CI jobs go in `ci-extra.yml`,
which nothing ever overwrites.

## Starting over

```bash
osprey reset          # stops everything, then deletes containers, agent data and {BUILD_OUTPUT_DIR}/
```

`reset` keeps `{STATE_DIR}/audit/` and your API keys. `osprey reset --purge-audit`
deletes the audit log as well; that plus deleting this folder removes it all.

## Backups

Git covers your settings. `{STATE_DIR}/` and `.env` are everything else, so a backup
is a copy of those two, and a restore is:

```bash
git clone <this repo> && tar xf state.tar.gz && osprey build && osprey up -d
```

# CI pair came to be regenerated by `--force` while the prose promised it was
# untouched. A file in no category is the bug; the test that enumerates a
# rendered repo against these tables is what catches it.
#
#   1. REPLACED   `profile_cmd.MATERIALIZED_SOURCE_ENTRIES` — the source zone.
#                 Drives `_replacing_source_zone`'s hold-aside and `_cleanup`'s
#                 rollback. The ONLY thing `--force` removes, and it removes it
#                 only once the replacement has been rendered and validated.
#   2. WRITE-ONCE :data:`WRITE_ONCE_FILES` below — the repo's own shell.
#                 Drives the write loop in `init`. Authored when absent, never
#                 rewritten, `--force` or not: from the moment they exist they
#                 are the facility's.
#   3. SCAFFOLDED :data:`CI_EMITTED_PATHS` below — the CI pair. Written by the
#                 scaffolding engine under its marker contract and never
#                 forced from here (see `_emit_ci`); regenerating an unmarked
#                 one is `osprey scaffold ci`'s job, with its own `--force`.

    :func:`_replacing_source_zone` restores what it moved on every exception,

    outright, and the holding directory
    (:data:`~.repo_resolver.HELD_SOURCE_ZONE_DIRNAME`) exists for as long as a
    materialization takes — so what that leaves is a repo whose source zone is
    intact but one directory down, where nothing can find it: the marker every
    verb discovers a repo by is in the holding directory too.

    This is the only code that puts it back. Every other verb reaches
    :func:`~.repo_resolver.find_repo_root`, which recognizes the same holding
    directory and says what happened — but recognizing is all it does, because a
    read path that repaired the repo underneath ``osprey status`` would be a
    surprise nobody asked for. It names this command as the repair instead.

    Mirrors :func:`~.build_cmd._repair_interrupted_swap`, which answers the same
    question for the render's staging directory.

    THE HELD COPY WINS. An entry standing in the repo AND held aside is a
    killed run's half-written output sitting where the facility's own zone
    belongs, so the output is removed and the held entry moves back over it.
    The rule is worth stating as a rule, because the tempting answer is the
    wrong one: when two copies of a zone exist, keep the one nothing can
    regenerate. Re-running the command reproduces the output; nothing
    reproduces a facility's edits.

    Only the names in :data:`~.profile_cmd.MATERIALIZED_SOURCE_ENTRIES` are
    reinstated — an unrecognized name is not something to move into a repo
    root sight unseen. Neither is it something to delete: the way one gets
    there is a crash under an osprey whose source zone included an entry this
    version has since renamed, which makes it a facility's file that this
    version simply has no place for. So the holding directory is removed only
    when the restore emptied it, and otherwise stays, named, for its owner to
    decide about. It is git-ignored, so leaving it costs nothing.
