"""Emitting a deployment repo's CI files, and re-emitting them safely.

A deployment repo holds its ``profile.yml`` at the root and everything the
profile implies around it. Two of those surrounding files are generated from
the profile rather than written by hand: the CI pipeline at the repo root, and
the post-deploy health check at ``scripts/verify.sh``. This module turns a
profile into both files and puts them where they belong — both paths
repo-relative, because the repo is the deployment: there is no project sibling
to key them off.

``osprey scaffold ci`` re-emits them; ``osprey init`` emits them the first
time. One engine, called twice, so a repo created today and a repo
re-scaffolded a year later carry the same two files.

Re-emission is the whole difficulty. A generated file that lands in a git
repository is read, diffed and eventually edited by people, so the engine has
to answer two questions before it writes anything:

*Is this file still ours?* Every emitted file carries a marker line naming what
generated it. A file without the marker was hand-written, renamed into place,
or predates the scaffolder — the engine refuses to touch it, and ``--force`` is
how an operator says they meant it. The marker is checked in the file's header
only, so a marker quoted further down in prose is not mistaken for provenance.

*Did anything actually change?* The version stamp beside the marker moves with
every OSPREY release, so a byte comparison would rewrite both files on every
upgrade and fill the repo's history with diffs that change nothing. The stamp
is normalized away before comparing: a file whose content is otherwise
identical is left exactly as it is, stamp included. The stamp then says which
release produced the content that is actually there, which is what it is for.
