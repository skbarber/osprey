"""CLI subcommands for the generated half of a deployment repo.

Two jobs, one group, because both are about material a deployment repo
generates rather than authors:

* ``osprey scaffold ci`` emits the repo's CI pipeline and post-deploy health
  check from the profile's ``deploy:`` block — the same engine
  ``osprey init`` runs at creation, so a repo scaffolded years apart carries
  the same two files.
* ``osprey scaffold list|claim|diff|unclaim`` inspect and take over the build
  artifacts a build renders into ``build/``.

Claiming is a *move into the source zone*: the profile is the source of truth
for what it builds, so an artifact an operator wants to own is moved out of the
disposable build zone and into the profile convention directory that owns its
destination, where the next build's convention scan registers it (see
:func:`osprey.cli.build_persistence._register_convention_artifacts`). Nothing
here writes ``scaffold.user_owned`` — a claim that edited the built config.yml
would be the second source of truth this design removes, and the next build
would wipe it with the zone it lives in.

Every verb here is repo-scoped: it takes the shared ``--repo`` and resolves
through :func:`osprey.cli.repo_resolver.find_repo_root`, so all of them act on
the repo the operator is standing in, whichever subdirectory that is.
