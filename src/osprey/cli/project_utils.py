"""Project-path resolution for the commands that take ``--project``.

The commands here (``health``, ``channel-finder``) accept something
:mod:`osprey.cli.repo_resolver` alone cannot answer for: a RENDERED project
directory, which holds a ``config.yml`` at its own root and no ``profile.yml``
anywhere above it. That is the whole reason ``--project`` exists beside
``--repo``, and the reason this module exists beside that one.

What it does NOT get to be is a second discovery rule. One question decides
between the two answers — *is the directory in hand itself a project?* — and
when it is not, the deployment repo enclosing it is found by
:func:`osprey.cli.repo_resolver.find_repo_root`, the same upward walk every
repo-scoped verb uses. So ``osprey health`` typed in ``<repo>/data/raw``
reports on that repo, exactly as ``git status`` typed there reports on the
repository, while ``--project`` pointed straight at a render still reports on
the render.

The bug this fixes was the absence of the walk: the stance was literally
``Path.cwd()``, so a subdirectory looked like a deployment with no config at
all, and ``osprey health`` exited 2 with an error row — "this deployment is
broken" to a CI gate and an operator both — over a working directory.

:func:`_clear_claude_code_project_state` has no caller. It is kept only because
removing it would also remove this module's re-export of
``encode_claude_project_path``, which a test still imports from here. Both
belong to a dead-code sweep, not to this module.

    the flat ``config.yml`` a rendered or container project directory holds at

    "not found" against it — and it is the one this directory would hold once

    would send an operator to a file no build ever writes.

    One question decides it: is the directory in hand — what ``--project``

    the answer. If it is not, the deployment repo enclosing it is, found by the

    (:func:`osprey.cli.repo_resolver.find_repo_root`). A directory that is
    neither is returned as-is, so the caller reports a missing config against
    the place the operator actually stood.

    The walk is what makes these commands behave like every other verb: run
    from ``<repo>/data/raw``, ``osprey health`` reports on that repo instead of
    calling it a deployment with no configuration.

    No environment variable sits between the two answers, and none belongs
    there: a variable that silently redirects a command to another directory
    means the same command line acts on different deployments depending on a
    shell the operator cannot see in the invocation.
