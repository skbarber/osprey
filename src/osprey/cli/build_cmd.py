"""Build command — render a deployment repo's ``build/`` zone from its profile.

``osprey build``, run anywhere inside a deployment repo, renders that repo's
OUTPUT zone: ``build/`` is the rendered project — ``config.yml``, ``.mcp.json``,
``.claude/``, the service tree, the compose files, the project venv — derived in
full from the SOURCE zone (``profile.yml`` at the repo root and the trees it
names). Nothing durable lives there, so it is wiped and re-rendered whole every
time; ``rm -rf build/`` loses nothing.

A repo with a ``personas/`` directory renders more than one project: the
deployment's own, plus ``build/<repo>-<persona>/`` for every delta in there
(:func:`_render_persona_projects`). That is the whole of when a persona project
is written — no start verb renders one — so ``build/`` is a complete account of
what a deploy will run, personas included.

The render is atomic. It lands in ``build/.tmp/`` and is swapped in by rename
only once every step has succeeded, so a build that fails — or is killed
mid-flight — leaves the previous ``build/`` exactly as it was, still able to
``osprey down`` the stack it started. :func:`_swap_in_render` documents the
rename sequence and what each failure point leaves behind.

Usage:
    osprey build                 # render this repo's build/
    osprey build --repo PATH     # …or another repo's, without cd-ing to it

The build pipeline's helper concerns live in sibling modules that this command
orchestrates: venv + ``.env`` templating in :mod:`osprey.cli.build_environment`,
lifecycle-phase execution in :mod:`osprey.cli.build_lifecycle`, service
injectors in :mod:`osprey.cli.build_injectors`, and project-directory
persistence (config overrides, convention artifacts, MCP servers, git init) in
:mod:`osprey.cli.build_persistence`. They are re-exported below so
``from osprey.cli.build_cmd import <helper>`` keeps working.

    lists the secret of every user whose persona's rendered ``config.yml``
    shows the BLUESKY tab, and what this pass writes is what ``osprey up``
    starts.

    The generator resolves its inputs relative to the working directory, which
    is what makes it stageable at all: run from the staged render, every service
    template it reads is the one this build just rendered.

    Its OUTPUT base is passed explicitly as the staging root, because the staged
    tree IS the future ``build/``. The staged ``config.yml`` says
    ``build_dir: ./build`` — correct for the deploy, which reads it from the
    repo root — and taking that value here would append a second ``build/`` to a
    directory that is already the output zone, landing every compose file at
    ``build/build/services/…``. Nothing would then resolve: the rendered files
    spell their own mounts against the repo root (``./build/services/<svc>/…``),
    which is where compose looks for them under the pinned
    ``--project-directory``. Rendered output and the service templates it is
    rendered FROM therefore share ``build/services/<svc>/`` and differ only by
    filename (``docker-compose.yml`` beside ``docker-compose.yml.j2``).

    Skipped under ``--runtime-root``. Compose generation is a *host-side* act:
    it resolves bind-mount sources against the config's ``project_root`` and

      dependencies from ``OSPREY_PIP_SPEC``;
    * **the compose files** — the deployment's compose describes the whole
      stack, personas included. A persona project is never deployed on its own;
    * **the lifecycle phases** — ``pre_build``/``post_build``/``validate`` are
      the profile's own shell commands, and a delta inherits them from the root.
      Running them once per persona would run the same commands three times over
      for one build.

    Args:
        shared: What this render has in common with every other in this build.
        resolved: The ``LoadedProfile`` for this project — for a persona, the
            delta already merged over the root profile, with the root as its
            profile directory.
        profile_path: The profile FILE this render came from, recorded in the
            manifest. The delta itself for a persona, so a rendered project can
            always name the source it is derived from.
        project_name: The rendered project's name and directory leaf.
        output_dir: The directory the render lands under.
        deployment: Whether this is the deployment's own project rather than a
            persona's. Gates the two things only it gets: the drift check's
            per-key manifest digests, and the provider-credential report (an
            account of the repo's one ``.env``, identical for every render).
        progress: Where the per-step progress lines go — ``logger.info`` for
            the deployment, ``logger.debug`` for a persona, whose steps are
            summarized in one line by :func:`_render_persona_projects`.
        extra_known: Repo-root entry names to exempt from the unknown-entry
            warning on top of the profile's own, so a persona render does not
            repeat a warning the deployment's render already made.
        injected_out: A list to record this render's injected service names in,
            for a caller that reports them. Passed rather than returned because
            a build renders six times and every pass injects the same set: the

    A ``.dockerignore`` is read at the context ROOT and nowhere else, and this
    context is a repo: its root holds ``profile.yml`` and the source zone, and
    everything the shipped patterns name — the render's own files above all —
    sits one level down under ``build/``. The rendered ``.dockerignore``
    (``templates/project/dockerignore``) was written for a context whose root
    *was* the render, so every one of its patterns is root-anchored, and at this
    depth root-anchored means matching nothing. Measured, not reasoned: in a
    context of exactly this shape, a plain ``.env*`` line let a ``.env`` one
    level down into the image; ``**/.env*`` kept it out. (The measurement is not
    re-stated with a specific path, because which file sat there depended on
    what the render carried at the time — the pattern-anchoring result is the
    durable part, and it is what the rest of this function rests on.)

    So the patterns are re-spelled ``**/``-anchored rather than copied. Docker
    matches a pattern against each path element, so the ``**/`` prefix is what
    turns "this name at the root" into "this name at any depth" — which is what
    every one of them meant in the first place. The file is derived from the
    render's own copy rather than restated here, so the two cannot drift: one
    list of what must never enter an image, spelled for two context shapes.

    Two deliberate differences from the source list:

    * ``Dockerfile`` is NOT excluded, so the image ships its own build recipe at
      ``build/Dockerfile``. Accepted deliberately, not by omission: at this depth
      the pattern would name the very file the build is driven from
      (``-f <context>/build/Dockerfile``), and :func:`_prune_ignored_entries`
      removes what this file excludes from the context tree — so excluding it
      would delete the recipe before docker could read it. It is also the honest
      shape: ``build/`` here IS a rendered deployment, and a rendered deployment
      on a host has its Dockerfile in it.
    * There is no ``build/`` entry (the source has none either, for the same
      reason): here ``build/`` IS the deployment being shipped, and excluding it
      would produce an image with no config, no ``.mcp.json`` and no Claude Code
      artifacts at all.

    This is the SECOND guard on the repo's secrets, not the first:
    :func:`_strip_secrets` has already removed every ``.env`` from the tree. Two
    independent guards is the right number for a facility's provider keys — but
    only if the one that runs at build time actually matches.

    Two records in a rendered manifest name the machine that built it, and both

    * ``build_args.profile_path`` / ``profile_path_abs`` — the profile this
      render came from, recorded as the building host's absolute path. Rewritten
      to paths inside the container, which is where those files actually are: the
      source zone travels with the render, so both the root profile and the
      persona deltas ARE in the image. These are the last host strings in the
      tree; with them gone, "no path in an image names the build machine" is a
      property that can be asserted in one line.

      The two are rewritten to DIFFERENT files, on purpose.
      ``profile_path`` keeps naming the file this render came from — the
      persona delta for a persona image — because that is its job: provenance.
      ``profile_path_abs`` is not provenance; it is the input
      :func:`~osprey.deployment.staleness.staleness_reasons` hashes and compares
      against ``creation.preset_hash``, so it must name the same file the stamp
      below is computed from — the repo's own ``profile.yml``. Pointed at the
      delta it would hash the delta against a root-profile stamp and every
      persona container would print "profile has changed" on an untouched build:
      a false drift report from the advisory while
      :func:`~osprey.deployment.staleness.check_drift`, which reads the profile
      off the repo root, correctly says CLEAN. Advisory and gate now agree by
      construction, because they hash the same file.
    * ``creation.preset_hash`` — the fingerprint
      :func:`osprey.deployment.staleness.check_drift` holds ``build/`` against.
      For the deployment's own image this is already right (same profile, same
      fold) and the rewrite is a no-op. For a PERSONA's image it is not: that
      render came from ``personas/<name>.yml`` merged over the root, while the
      ``profile.yml`` at the root of the repo the image carries is the root
      profile — so an operator running ``osprey status`` in that container would
      be told its own untouched build had drifted. Re-stamped from the profile
      the container actually holds, which is the profile that produced this
      whole tree; the persona delta is folded into that fingerprint too.

    A rendered project records absolute paths — ``project_root`` in
    ``config.yml``, and the ``OSPREY_CONFIG`` / ``CONFIG_FILE`` every MCP server
    in ``.mcp.json`` is handed — and the host's are not the container's. An image
    built from the host render therefore ships servers pointed at the building
    machine's directories, and an agent whose ``agent_data.base_dir`` resolves
    beside the mounted volume rather than into it. So the build renders the
    project a second time, against the path the container will see it at.

    ``--runtime-root`` is that substitution and already exists; this is its
    caller. The render is otherwise the deployment's own, from the same resolved
    profile, so the image cannot disagree with the host about anything except
    where it is.

    The result is a REPO, not a render: ``profile.yml`` and the rest of the
    source zone at ``<image root>/``, the render below it in ``build/``. That is
    the one container layout — ``{project_root}/build/config.yml`` is then true
    in a container exactly as it is on a host, which is what
    :data:`~osprey.registry.mcp.RENDERED_CONFIG_ENV_VALUE` has always claimed —
    and it is what lets the image's ``Dockerfile`` stay a verbatim ``COPY`` of
    its build context.

    Lands in the staged tree, so it transits the atomic swap with everything
    else: a container copy that fails to render fails the whole build and leaves
    the previous ``build/`` — every project in it — exactly as it was.

    What it deliberately does NOT get, beyond what a persona render skips:

    * **the venv and the dependency install** — an image builds its own
      environment from ``OSPREY_PIP_SPEC``, and a venv recording the host's
      interpreter would be actively wrong inside a container. ``shared`` already
      carries the resolved dependency list, so the rendered ``Dockerfile`` still
      names the right requirements;
    * **the compose files** — skipped by :func:`_render_compose_files` under a
      runtime root anyway, and compose is a host-side concern: it is what starts
      the container, not something the container holds;
    * **the lifecycle phases** — ``pre_build``/``post_build``/``validate`` are
      the profile's own shell commands and ran once for this build already.

    The last link of the virtual accelerator's channel chain, and the only one
    that reaches outside ``build/``. The generator writes its manifest into the
    output zone (:func:`_render_project`); the VA compose service mounts that
    directory; and the address of the manifest *inside* the mount travels as
    ``VA_CHANNELS_FILE``, which compose can only substitute from the repo-root
    ``.env`` it is handed as ``--env-file``. Nothing else reads these keys —
    the container's entrypoint takes them straight from its environment — so
    this is where the pointer is written or it is not written at all.

    Two rules, and neither is negotiable:

    * **Append-only.** That ``.env`` is the deployment's whole secret store:
      hand-edited, and written back to by ``osprey up`` with tokens the running
      volumes are pinned to. The build writes it through the same
      :func:`~osprey.utils.dotenv.append_profile_env` every other writer uses,
      so a value already on file always wins and a disagreement is *reported*
      rather than resolved. Repointing a running IOC's channel set from under
      an operator, on a rebuild they ran for some unrelated reason, is not a
      thing a build gets to do.
    * **After the swap.** Called once ``build/`` is the tree this render
      produced, and gated on the manifest being in it — so the pointer is only
      ever written when the file it names is already there to be found. A build
      that fails leaves ``build/`` as it was and this never runs.

    The reverse case — a repo whose ``.env`` still carries a pointer from a
    build that could generate a manifest, run again on a tree that cannot — is
    the one thing append-only cannot fix by itself, so it is warned about by
    name. The stale pointer is not harmless: the entrypoint *raises* on a
    manifest file it cannot find rather than falling back to the packaged
    channel set, so the next start gets a container that will not boot.

    :func:`~osprey.cli.profile_conventions.is_setup_patch_capable` answers this
    for a rendered persona config; this reaches the same answer one step
    earlier, from the ``config:`` overrides that config is about to be written
    from. The composition — deny minus ``remove_deny``, because a persona tier
    that lifts an inherited deny is capable — is NOT repeated here: the
    overrides are assembled into the ``config.yml``-shaped document the
    predicate reads and it does the subtraction, so there is one composition
    for both callers to be wrong or right together.

    The SPELLING is not owned here either, and deliberately no longer is.
    ``claude_code.permissions.deny`` can be written as one dotted key, as a
    ``claude_code.permissions:`` mapping holding ``deny``, or as a fully nested
    ``claude_code:`` block, and all three reach the same leaf in the rendered
    ``config.yml`` — ``config_update_fields`` takes any of them. This function
    used to read the first and the third; the middle one renders and was read as
    nothing, so a profile that denied the setup tool through
    ``claude_code.permissions: {deny: [...]}`` was reported capable and the
    Dockerfile chowned ``build/config.yml`` to a persona whose ``settings.json``
    denies the tool. Rather than adding the third reader,
    :func:`~osprey.deployment.web_terminals.personas.persona_capability_document`
    — the guard belt's reader, which already tries every split point — assembles
    the document, so exactly one spelling reader exists in the codebase and the
    container's verdict cannot disagree with the guard's about what a profile
    says.

    Reading every spelling and unioning them is exact rather than merely broad
    because a profile cannot carry two of them at once:
    :func:`~osprey.cli.build_profile_load._reject_mixed_claude_code_spellings`
    refuses a ``config:`` block that spells any ``claude_code`` path two ways,
    since ``config_update_fields`` would silently apply one and discard the
    other. Absent that refusal the union would be wrong in the direction that
    matters: ``remove_deny`` GRANTS the capability, so unioning a dotted lift
    with a nested deny would report ``True`` for a render whose
    ``settings.json`` denies the tool.

    """The template context for a four-zone render.

    Two values in here are what make the render a *repo's* render rather than a
    directory's:

    ``project_root`` is the REPO root, not the directory being written. The
    render lives one level down in ``build/``, and every relative path in the
    generated config — the agent-data root, the audit log, the mounted ``.env``
    — is anchored on this value, so anchoring it on the render would put the
    deployment's durable state inside the zone that is wiped on every build.
    ``--runtime-root`` substitutes the path a *container* sees the repo at, for
    a build whose output runs somewhere other than where it was made.

    ``current_python_env`` is the interpreter every process that imports osprey
    is launched with — MCP servers, framework hooks, ``{current_python_env}``
    substitution in the registry — so every branch must produce one that has
    osprey importable. It names the venv's FINAL path, which is where the venv
    is created and where the swap leaves it. *runtime_interpreter* replaces the
    whole derivation for a render whose processes start on another machine
    (:data:`_CONTAINER_INTERPRETER`), where none of this filesystem's answers
    exist.

    ``port_base`` is the third, and it is resolved here because this is the
    one place that holds both the profile and every render made from it: the
    project render, the persona renders and the reading of what the app
    template deploys at its defaults all take their ports from this value.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the profile's ``deployment.port_base`` is out of range;
            see :func:`_profile_port_base`.

    Run with no arguments, anywhere inside a deployment repo. It walks up to the
    repo's profile.yml and renders the whole OUTPUT zone from it: config.yml,
    the Claude Code artifacts, the data tree, the service templates and the
    compose files that deploy them.

    build/ is derived in full and holds nothing durable — your keys are in .env,
    the agent's memory is in var/ — so every build wipes and re-renders it. The
    render lands in build/.tmp and replaces build/ only once it has succeeded: a
    build that fails, or one you interrupt, leaves the previous build exactly as
    it was, still able to stop the stack it started.

    Renders files, never containers: rebuild while the stack is up and the
    change takes effect at the next `osprey up` or `osprey restart`.
