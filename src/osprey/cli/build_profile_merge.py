    ``exclude`` is a mapping of field name to a list of entries to remove, and
    the SPELLING of each entry decides which of the two things it removes:

    * bare (``channel-finder``) subtracts from the string list
      (:data:`_EXCLUDABLE_FIELDS`), so a built-in artifact an ``extends`` base
      selected is no longer selected;
    * qualified (``agents/channel-finder``) records the entry in ``artifacts``
      as ``"<source>/<name>"`` so the build omits the profile's own file for
      it, leaving the list alone.

    Keeping them apart is what makes FR-10's promise true: a profile that ships
    ``agents/channel-finder.md`` shadows the built-in agent of that name, and
    excluding the shadow by its qualified spelling drops only the file, so the
    still-selected built-in version renders again. Conflating the two would
    delete both and the artifact would vanish entirely.

    A bare entry that the built-in library does *not* carry is recorded as a
    file omission too — it cannot be a library selection (``validate_artifacts``
    would reject it), so the only thing it can mean is the profile's own file.
    Dict-shaped fields (``mcp_servers``, ``services``) drop the declaration on
    either spelling: the declaration names the profile's own directory, so
    omitting the files while leaving it standing would deploy a server whose
    source is missing, and there is no built-in version to fall back to.

    Excluding an entry that is not present is a silent no-op. Because this runs
    after each ``_deep_merge`` in :func:`_resolve_extends`, a deeper ``extends``
    layer that re-adds an entry merges in afterwards and wins; an entry re-added
    by an override file or ``--set`` merges *before* extends resolution and is
    stripped again here, so it cannot win.

    Every regular file under ``source`` contributes its path relative to

    joined with the SHA-256 of its bytes. Entries are sorted by that relative
    path, and directories themselves contribute nothing — only their files —
    so the digest depends on content alone and not on filesystem walk order.

    ``skip_runtime_output`` is passed for the ``data:`` tree only: the
    top-level :data:`~osprey_connectors.workspace.RUNTIME_DATA_DIR_NAME`
    subtree is where ``osprey up`` mints its own material (per-lane CURVE
    certificates), and hashing it would make every successful start mark its
    own build OUT OF DATE (#716). The subtree is skipped statically — by its
    reserved name, not by a manifest — so the fold and the writer cannot fall
    out of sync about which files a start is allowed to create.

    A ``source`` that does not exist folds only its ``label``: the profile keys
    that name it are already in the canonical JSON, so a vanished tree still
    reads differently from a populated one without this function having to
    invent a marker for it.

    Two limits of the walk, both deliberate:

    * Symlinks. A symlinked *file* is folded — ``is_file`` and ``read_bytes``
      both follow it — and so is a ``source`` that is itself a symlink to a
      directory, which arrives here already resolved. A symlinked *directory
      nested inside* the tree is not: ``rglob`` does not recurse into one, so
      its contents are invisible to the digest while ``shutil.copytree``
      (``symlinks=False``) does follow it and copy them into the project. A
      data tree that reaches its content through a nested directory symlink
      therefore has a known blind spot in the staleness advisory: edits behind
      that link do not move the hash. Recursing resolved targets would change
      the pinned algorithm and is left to the maintainer.
    * Unicode. Relative paths are folded as their UTF-8 bytes with no
      normalization, so cross-platform determinism is guaranteed for ASCII
      names; a non-ASCII name stored NFD on one filesystem and NFC on another
      hashes differently.

    The canonical JSON alone captures what a profile says; it cannot see what
    the trees it points at contain. Without this, editing a facility's channel
    database, a rule the agent reads, or the trigger table a dispatcher fires
    on leaves the profile hash untouched and the deploy-side staleness advisory
    stays silent about a project that no longer matches its source.

    Four kinds of input are covered:

    * the ``data:`` tree, anchored via
      :meth:`~osprey.cli.build_profile_model.BuildProfile.resolved_data_root`
      so it resolves exactly where the build copies it from — minus the
      reserved ``data/.runtime/`` subtree
      (:data:`~osprey_connectors.workspace.RUNTIME_DATA_DIR_NAME`), which is
      runtime-minted material (the Bluesky lanes' CURVE certificates) and
      never build input: fold it and every successful ``osprey up`` marks its
      own build OUT OF DATE, stranding a bare ``osprey up -d`` boot unit at
      the drift gate (#716);
    * every convention directory the profile carries
      (:data:`~osprey.cli.profile_conventions.CONVENTION_SOURCES`, which
      includes the ``project/`` verbatim mirror), folded in sorted name order
      so reordering the mapping table cannot move a hash;
    * ``triggers.yml``, the dispatch trigger table the build materializes;
    * every persona delta in ``personas/`` — the files a deployment's own
      per-persona projects are rendered from. Without them, editing a delta
      moves no hash at all: the deploy-side check would call the build clean,
      no rebuild would follow, and the persona render already on disk (which
      ``up`` re-renders only when it is *absent*) would keep shipping the
      superseded delta into that persona's image.

    Personas are folded as the *direct children* of ``personas/`` and nothing
    deeper, because that is exactly the set that can be built: a file is read
    as a delta only when its parent directory IS ``personas/``
    (:func:`~osprey.cli.profile_root.resolve_profile_root`), so a tree nested
    below it is no more build input than a ``README`` beside ``profile.yml``.
    Suffixes are not filtered — a delta is named by the persona catalog, which
    accepts any direct child — while dot-prefixed entries are skipped, matching
    the walk every other convention read uses: a ``.DS_Store`` must not report a
    deployment as stale.

    One consequence, accepted rather than worked around: this is folded for a
    persona delta too (its root_dir is the profile root), so editing ONE delta
    moves every sibling persona's hash as well. That is the same over-report as
    a root edit reaching every persona — it costs an idempotent rebuild, where
    subtracting siblings would cost a persona that silently no longer matches
    its source.

    A convention directory, ``triggers.yml`` or ``personas/`` that is absent
    folds nothing at all, so a profile carrying none of them hashes exactly as
    it did before they existed. Creating an empty convention directory does
    move the hash — it folds its label — which is honest: the profile tree
    changed.

    Args:
        digest: The hash object to update in place.
        resolved: The profile after ``extends`` (and persona-delta) resolution.
        profile_dir: The profile root every relative path anchors at.
        conventions: Whether to fold convention material. ``False`` for a
            bundled preset, which is one file among many in a shared package
            directory rather than a profile root of its own — folding there
            would make every preset's hash depend on every other preset's
            neighbouring directories.

    Hashes the *resolved* content (canonical JSON, sorted keys) rather than

    ``extends`` parent is not. The file inputs the resolved profile names — its
    ``data:`` tree, convention directories, ``triggers.yml`` and the persona
    deltas in ``personas/`` — are folded in on top by
    :func:`_fold_profile_material`, so a project whose facility data changed
    under an unchanged profile still reads as stale.

    Resolution goes through :func:`resolve_profile_document`, the same call the
    loader makes: the hash can only say honestly whether a built project still
    matches its source if it resolves the *same* document the build resolved.
    That is also what makes a root edit move every persona project's hash.

    The excluded-artifact record is folded in as well. It is derived state, not
    profile content, so the canonical JSON cannot see it — yet two personas
    differing only by a ``commands:`` exclusion build different projects, and
    without this they would hash identically and neither would ever read stale.

    What goes in is the profile's declared selection lists, not the *effective*
    post-shadow ones: a bare exclusion of a name the profile also shadows moves
    the hash while rendering byte-identical output, and that over-report is
    accepted on purpose. Subtracting the effective selection would mean
    re-deriving the build's shadow rule inside the hash, and any drift between
    the two would make the hash miss a real divergence — the one failure this
    advisory exists to prevent. Over-reporting costs an idempotent rebuild;
    under-reporting costs a project that silently no longer matches its source,
    so the conservative input is the right one.
    :func:`_warn_shadowed_bare_exclusions` keeps that case loud rather than
    letting an author sit on a no-op exclusion forever.

    ``raw`` is normalized to the canonical field spellings first, so a caller
    that hands over a dict which did not come from
    :func:`~osprey.cli.build_profile_document._read_profile_document` hashes
    the same as one that did — the YAML-surface rename must not move any
    profile's hash. Normalizing before ``extends`` resolution (rather than
    after) keeps the deep merge child-wins across a mixed-spelling chain.

    ``overlay`` is the host-variant profile this repo builds, when one is
    selected — the layer ``raw`` does not carry, because the hash resolves the
    TRACKED document while the render merges the overlay over it. It is folded
    as file material rather than merged in: :func:`_fold_source_tree`
    contributes the file's NAME beside its content, so an edit to the selected
    overlay and a switch between two byte-identical overlays both move the hash,
    while an overlay this host did not select folds nothing. No overlay folds
    nothing at all, which is what keeps every repo that defines no variants
