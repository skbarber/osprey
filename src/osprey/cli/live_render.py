"""The live build region: a build snapshot in, one Rich renderable out.

A cold ``compose build`` spends a quarter of an hour inside a single phase, and
the plain ``→ Building services`` line that opens it says nothing for the rest of
that time. On a terminal a live region is therefore drawn beneath that line: a
spinner with a ticking duration, and under it one row per service, fed from
:class:`osprey.deployment.build_progress.BuildModel`:

.. code-block:: text

    → Building services                    <- printed once, permanently
      · compose config validated (1.2s)    <- printed once, permanently
      ⠹ 4m12s                              <- from here down, the live region

        virtual-accelerator   6/8         Downloading torch (2.1 GB)…   4m02s
        bluesky-bridge        3/8         RUN pip install -e .          1m18s
        event-dispatcher      exporting   exporting layers              3m41s

The region never repeats the phase's title. The phase announced itself with a
permanent ``→ title`` line the moment it opened, and a title redrawn underneath
that line reads as a rendering glitch rather than as progress; what the region
adds is the part that could not be printed once — a spinner and a duration that
keep moving. Printing the title exactly once also keeps the phase lines in the
terminal's scrollback in the same words a piped run writes them.

The ticker sits at the indent of the ``  · step`` lines the phase reporter
prints, so it reads as belonging to the ``→ title`` above it, and the rows sit
one level deeper still, so the table reads as nested under the phase rather than
as a peer of it.

A service leaves the table the moment its image is finished. Its completion is
already in the scrollback as a step line of its own, permanently, so repeating
it here says nothing new while crowding out what the operator is actually
waiting on — and the table shrinks as the build lands each image. It keeps this
region honest against the off-terminal heartbeat too, which likewise stops
reporting a service once its image is built.

This module is the rendering half and nothing else: it owns no thread, no
:class:`~rich.live.Live`, no console and no clock. Both timings arrive as
arguments — the phase's ``elapsed`` and the caller's ``now`` — for the same
reason :meth:`BuildModel.feed` takes its timestamp: the caller measures time
once, and a fifteen-minute build renders identically from a fixture.

Every style here is a semantic token from :mod:`osprey.cli.styles`, resolved
through the active Rich theme. Nothing names a color, so a ``cli.theme`` change
reaches this region like it reaches the rest of the CLI.

    Args:
        rows: One :class:`~osprey.deployment.build_progress.BuildRow` per
            service, in the order they should appear. Usually a
            :meth:`BuildModel.snapshot`. Rows whose image is already finished

        phase_open: Whether a phase is open, and so whether the region carries a
            ticker at all. A boolean rather than the phase's title, because the
            title is not drawn here: it is already in the scrollback, printed
            once, by the line that opened the phase.

        now: The caller's current :func:`time.monotonic` reading, against which
            each row's age is measured.
        width: Columns the region may occupy — normally ``console.width``. Only
            the caption gives way to it; the other columns are sized by content.
