    paged listing instead. Keeping them the same number means a facility never
    tunes one against the other.

    Authored per facility, because "how many devices is too many to read in one
    breath" is a property of the facility's device file, not of OSPREY. The
    default is deliberately generous: a deployment whose device file is smaller
    than this never sees a second page and never sees a truncated refusal.

    At the default value this key renders NOTHING into ``config.yml`` or the
    compose file — the rendered deployment carries the key only when a profile
    authors a value that differs, and the bridge falls back to the same default
    when the env var is absent.

        Derived rather than configured (see :data:`SECOND_LANE_PORT_STRIDE`) —
        but derived is not the same as unchecked. Left alone, the derivation
        lands exactly on the ``bluesky_second_lane`` slot the block reserves for
        it. What can move it is an ABSOLUTE ``services.bluesky.port``: lane 2
        rides along, off its reserved slot and possibly onto a port the block
        already spends. So the result is re-tested against the whole layout at
        the base this deployment resolved, and against :attr:`tiled_port`, the
        one neighbour an author may move on its own.

        Raising is the point: the alternative is a rendered compose file whose
        services fight over a port, which surfaces as a container that will not
        start long after the build reported success.

        Only the LAYOUT's slots are checked here — one port per slot, at the
        first index of a band. A collision with a port this particular profile
        spends is :meth:`BuildProfile.validate`'s sweep to report, which knows
        which services the profile actually deploys.

                — for a caller holding a raw profile, what
                ``build_profile_load._profile_port_base`` returns. ``None``
                means :data:`~osprey.port_layout.DEFAULT_PORT_BASE`, which is
                right only when there is no config to resolve.
