"""``osprey reset`` — the factory reset, and the only verb that destroys data.

The command layer is deliberately thin: it resolves the repo, hands the work to
:mod:`osprey.deployment.reset`, and turns that module's two refusals into
operator-facing exits. Everything that decides what gets removed — the identity
scoping, the plan, the typed gate — lives in the deployment layer, where it can
be tested without a container runtime and where the plan an operator reads and
the program that runs are the same object.

    """Wipe this deployment back to a fresh state.

    Run with no arguments, anywhere inside a deployment repo. It stops the
    stack, removes the containers and volumes carrying this checkout's identity
    along with the images this deployment built, destroys the agent's memory
    under var/agent_data/, strips the tokens `osprey up` minted out of .env, and
    deletes build/.

    Two things survive, and the plan says so before you confirm:

    \b
      var/audit/   the safety audit log — what the agent was asked to do and
                   what it did. Pass --purge-audit to destroy it too.
      .env         everything in it that a deploy did not mint, which is your
                   provider keys.

    The source zone is never touched: profile.yml, data/, personas/, triggers.yml
    and .git are exactly what they were. After a reset, `osprey build && osprey
    up -d` gives you the same deployment with no state.

    A compose project name comes from this directory's NAME, so two clones or
    worktrees of one deployment share it. Reset removes a container or volume
    only when it also carries this repo's identity label — a hash of its path —
    and refuses outright, removing nothing, when it finds same-named resources
    created from a different path. Renaming or moving this directory changes
    that hash, so its own older resources read as foreign too; the refusal says
    so and still will not remove them.

    Exit status, so `osprey reset && ...` means what it looks like:

    \b
      0   the reset did what it said, or there was nothing to do
      1   you declined, or it refused — nothing was touched
      3   it ran, but this deployment is only partly reset (each
          survivor is named above the exit)

    2 is never this command's: it is what any command line tool returns
    for a bad flag, and a half-reset deployment must not look like a typo.

    Examples:

    \b
      # See what would go, without touching anything
      $ osprey reset --dry-run

    \b
      # Start over
      $ osprey reset

    \b
      # Complete uninstall, from the parent directory afterwards
      $ osprey reset --purge-audit -y && rm -rf <this directory>
