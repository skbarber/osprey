"""Profile-directory conventions — the canonical profile → project mapping.

A build profile is the source of truth for the project it builds, so every
artifact class it can carry has exactly one channel into the project. This
module is that channel table, plus the validation that keeps it honest:

* :data:`CONVENTION_DIRS` — the mapping itself (``rules/`` → ``.claude/rules/``
  and friends), including ``project/``, the verbatim path mirror that exists as
  an escape hatch for anything without a dedicated channel.
* :func:`validate_convention_sources` — up-front source validation, so a
  misshapen convention directory fails with an actionable message before the
  build writes anything.
* :func:`reserved_path_channel` — build-owned destinations the ``project/``
  mirror may not write, each naming the channel that *does* own them. These
  enforce pipeline coherence (exactly one writer per artifact), not sandboxing:
  the profile is operator-trusted.
* :func:`plan_convention_copies` — the pure source → destination plan a build
  carries out.
* :func:`ownership_name` — the destination → ``scaffold.user_owned`` name rule,
  shared by the build that registers ownership and the render that honors it.

Everything here is pure: it reads the profile tree and returns plans, names, or
errors. Nothing writes into a project.
