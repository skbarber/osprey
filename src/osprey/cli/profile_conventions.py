"""Profile-directory conventions — the canonical profile → project mapping.

A build profile is the source of truth for the project it builds, so every
artifact class it can carry has exactly one channel into the project. This
module is that channel table, plus the validation that keeps it honest:

* :data:`CONVENTION_DIRS` — the mapping itself (``rules/`` → ``.claude/rules/``
  and friends), including ``project/``, the verbatim path mirror that exists as
  an escape hatch for anything without a dedicated channel.
* :func:`validate_convention_sources` — up-front source validation, so a
  misshapen convention directory fails with an actionable message before the
  build writes anything.
* :func:`reserved_path_channel` — build-owned destinations the ``project/``
  mirror may not write, each naming the channel that *does* own them. These
  enforce pipeline coherence (exactly one writer per artifact), not sandboxing:
  the profile is operator-trusted.
* :func:`is_reserved_write` and :func:`is_protected_key` — the *protected set*:
  the paths and config keys a running agent may not rewrite, consulted by every
  framework writer. A separate question from the reservations above, which ask
  which build channel owns a path (see :func:`is_reserved_write`).
* :func:`is_setup_patch_capable` — the posture read shared by every gate that
  has to know whether a rendered persona can still reach the setup tool.
* :func:`plan_convention_copies` — the pure source → destination plan a build
  carries out.
* :func:`ownership_name` — the destination → ``scaffold.user_owned`` name rule,
  shared by the build that registers ownership and the render that honors it.

Everything here is pure: it reads the profile tree and returns plans, names, or
errors. Nothing writes into a project.

    :func:`reserved_path_channel`, and the two must not be conflated:

    * :func:`reserved_path_channel` asks *which build channel owns this path*,
      so that the profile's ``project/`` mirror cannot become a second writer on
      an artifact some convention directory already produces. It covers every
      ``.claude/`` subtree that has a channel.
    * This function asks *may a running agent rewrite this*. It is narrower
      under ``.claude/`` — authoring a subagent or a slash command is the point
      of the panel, so those subtrees stay open — and wider outside it, because
      a settings overlay, an ``osprey_`` hook or the limits table can change
      what the agent is allowed to do even when no build channel is involved.

    Two normalizations make the answer depend on which *file* is named rather
    than on how the writer spelled it:

    * The path is run through :func:`posixpath.normpath` first, so ``./x``,
      ``a//b`` and ``foo/../.claude/skills/x`` all ask the same question as
      their plain spellings. Without it a writer dodges the whole set by
      spelling a path the long way round. A path that is absolute, or that
      still starts with ``..`` after normalization, is not project-relative;
      it is refused with :data:`NOT_PROJECT_RELATIVE_CHANNEL` rather than
      allowed, because "not a path I can judge" must not read as "writable".
    * Both the path and the patterns are casefolded before matching. The
      framework runs on case-insensitive filesystems, where
      ``.CLAUDE/Skills/x`` and ``.claude/settings.LOCAL.json`` open exactly the
      protected files, so a case-sensitive match would be a protected set only

      persona-roster guard hold, and the primary input. This shape is NOT yet
      composed: a profile delta cannot subtract from an inherited list, so a
      tier that lifts a base deny carries the inherited ``deny`` and its own
      ``claude_code.permissions.remove_deny`` side by side, and the
      subtraction happens when ``settings.json`` is rendered. So it is
      performed here too, the same way and for the same reason: reading the
      raw ``deny`` alone would report a lifted tier as denied while its
      rendered ``settings.json`` lets the tool through — a *disagreement with
      the render*, which is the one thing this must not have. Which consumer
      that would hurt depends on the consumer (see
      :func:`is_setup_patch_capable`); that it is wrong does not;
    * a rendered ``.claude/settings.json``, which has no ``claude_code:``
      wrapper and carries ``permissions.deny`` at the top level. Read only when
      no ``claude_code`` block is present, which a persona config always has
      when it says anything about permissions at all. Without this branch a
      settings document handed here would find nothing and read as *capable*
      while the tool is in fact denied — a mis-call must not fail open. This
      shape is already composed, so no subtraction is applied to it and a
      stray top-level ``remove_deny`` is ignored.

    The subtraction mirrors the render exactly — that is its whole
    justification, not a lean in a safe direction. See
    :func:`osprey.cli.templates.claude_code._rendered_deny_list`, which builds
    the rendered array as ``[d for d in deny_defaults if d not in remove_deny]``
    plus the same filter over the facility deny: membership is **exact**, not
    glob. So a wildcard deny (``mcp__osprey_workspace__*``) is NOT lifted by an
    exact ``remove_deny`` of one tool name — the render leaves that wildcard in
    the deny array, and so does this.

    Kill-switch entries cannot be lifted here, and not merely by convention:
    they are generated at render time from ``writes_enabled: false`` into their
    own context key and never appear in a ``config.yml`` deny list, so there is
    nothing for this subtraction to reach. The render keeps them out of the
    filtered lists for exactly that reason.

    Anything not shaped like a mapping yields no entries; see
    :func:`permission_entries` for how each list is read, and for why a list
    spelled as a bare string is read as no entries here rather than as one —
    the render does not read it as one either, and a profile that spells it

    The posture question every later gate asks about a persona: can this render
    still reach :data:`SETUP_PATCH_TOOL`? Consumed by the container's render
    context, by the persona-roster guard, and by the lint belt, so that all
    three answer it the same way instead of each re-reading the deny list.

    ``config`` is a **rendered persona config** — the ``config.yml``-shaped
    document whose deny list lives at ``claude_code.permissions.deny``, read
    together with the ``remove_deny`` beside it so that a tier which lifts an
    inherited deny reports as capable. A rendered ``.claude/settings.json``
    (deny at the top level, already composed) is read too; see
    :func:`_deny_entries` for how the two are told apart, how the subtraction
    mirrors the render, and why a kill-switch deny is out of its reach.

    The deny is what *removes* the capability, so every way of not having one —
    no ``claude_code`` block, no ``permissions``, no ``deny`` key, an empty or
    null deny — leaves the persona capable. This is not a permissive default
    dressed up as a rule: an unwritten deny is exactly the state of a project
    that never gated the tool, and the readonly tier expresses itself by
    *adding* the entry.

    Entries are matched with :func:`fnmatch.fnmatchcase`, which covers the exact
    literal the presets write and also a wildcard deny (``mcp__osprey_workspace__*``)
    that takes the tool away just as completely. The asymmetry against the exact
    ``remove_deny`` subtraction is not a lean in a safe direction but a pair of
    mirrors, each held against the thing it has to agree with: the glob **match**
    mirrors Claude Code's own deny matching, where a deny pattern gates every
    tool name it matches; the exact **subtraction** mirrors the render's
    ``d not in remove_deny``
    (:func:`osprey.cli.templates.claude_code._rendered_deny_list`).

    **Parity is the criterion, not conservatism**, because the two consumers
    pull in opposite directions. The container's Dockerfile *grants* the
    ``build/config.yml`` chown on ``True``; the persona-roster guard *refuses*
    a ``default_persona`` or ``login: false`` on ``True``. So there is no safe
    direction to lean: an answer biased toward ``False`` waves a capable
    persona past the roster guard, and one biased toward ``True`` hands an
    image's ``config.yml`` to an agent that cannot in fact patch it. The only
    answer that serves both consumers is the render's own, which is why every
    reading rule here is stated as a mirror of the render rather than as a
    fail-safe. The parity itself is pinned by
