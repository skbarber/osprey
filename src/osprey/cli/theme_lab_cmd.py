"""CLI command for the OSPREY Theme Lab.

Provides ``osprey theme-lab``: serves the design-system static directory on a
local port and opens the Theme Lab page, an interactive workbench for building
and previewing OSPREY themes against the live design tokens.

The command is intentionally project-independent — the Theme Lab reads only the
design system that ships inside the wheel, so it runs from any directory without
a ``config.yml``.
