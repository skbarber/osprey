"""The closing summary card for the OSPREY lifecycle verbs.

``init``, ``build``, ``up -d``, ``restart -d`` and ``down`` all end the same
way: one short card saying which deployment this was, what state it is in now,
where it answers, where the command output went, and which command comes next.
One renderer for all five, so the five cannot describe the same deployment in
five shapes.

It prints after the last phase has closed, through the CLI's renderer
(:mod:`osprey.cli.output`) rather than through the phase reporter. The card is
the verb's own output, not decoration on its progress: it says what the run
left behind, so it is echo-class and prints under every reporter -- including
the one the global ``--verbose`` installs, where the phase record itself is
swallowed. Attached (non-``-d``) starts print no card at all: ``compose up``
replaces this process and the terminal belongs to the log stream.

The rows are a key/value block, which is what :func:`osprey.cli.output.section`
renders, so the card is laid out by the same code as every other block of facts
the CLI prints. Only the wording stays here: which states exist and what to run
next are this module's business, not the renderer's.
