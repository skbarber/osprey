    Run with no arguments, anywhere inside a deployment repo. It starts what the
    last `osprey build` rendered, and re-renders nothing from profile.yml — so
    the services that come up are always the ones you can read on disk.

    One exception, by design: a deployment with web terminals re-renders that
    stack at every start (its compose file, nginx config, landing page, and any
    persona whose project is missing). Those follow the user roster rather than
    the build, so a roster edit takes effect on the next start.

    It reads profile.yml for one thing: a fingerprint. If the profile has
    changed since the build, up refuses and says what moved, because starting
    would deploy something other than what the profile now describes. Pass
    --build to re-render first, or --as-built to start the old render knowingly.

    Whether this deployment is reachable off-host is a property of the build,
    not of this command: the bind address is rendered into every published port.
    Change it with `osprey set deployment.bind_address=0.0.0.0`, then rebuild.
    The fail-closed service-token rules read what the build actually publishes,
    so an exposed deployment is treated as exposed either way.

    Examples:

    \b
      # Start it, in the background
      $ osprey up -d

    \b
      # Pick up a profile edit, then start
      $ osprey up --build -d

    Run with no arguments, anywhere inside a deployment repo. It stops what the

    with web terminals has that stack stopped first, because it is a separate
    compose invocation whose containers take host-global names that the next web
    deployment on this machine would otherwise collide with.

    Volumes are kept. Every one of them: the databases, the artifact store, the
    per-user terminal workspaces. Stopping a deployment is not a way to lose its
    data, and destroying data is `osprey reset`, which asks first.

    It renders nothing. If build/ is gone or was never rendered, down does not
    re-derive the compose files from profile.yml to stop with -- those files
    describe what would be started now, not what is running. Instead it stops the
    containers this repo labelled as its own, which is the recovery path for a
    build/ deleted while the stack was up.

    That fallback has one honest limit. Containers are labelled when they are
    CREATED, so a stack started before this version of OSPREY carries no label
    and cannot be found this way. Run `osprey build` to restore build/, and down
    works normally again.

    Run with no arguments, anywhere inside a deployment repo. It is a stop
    followed by a start, not a container restart: the containers are recreated,
    so a rebuilt image, an edited compose file or a freshly minted token is
    actually picked up. Restarting containers in place would leave every one of
    those changes on the floor.

    Because it ends in a start, it obeys the same rule as `osprey up`. It starts
    what the last build rendered and re-renders nothing from profile.yml, and if
    profile.yml or a file it points at has changed since the build it refuses and
    says what moved, rather than stopping a running stack to bring up something
    you did not build.
    Pass --build to re-render first, or --as-built to restart the old render
    knowingly. Web terminals are the same documented exception they are for up:
    that stack's compose file, nginx config and landing page are re-rendered at
    start, because those three follow the user roster.

    Nothing is stopped until the start is known to be possible. A refused drift
    check, a build with nothing in it, a --dev that cannot stage a wheel: each of
    those leaves the running stack exactly as it was.

    Volumes survive, as they do for down. Service tokens are minted again on the
    way back up, into this repo's .env.

    With --build the stop uses the newly rendered compose files, so a service you
    deleted from profile.yml in that same edit is no longer named in them and
    keeps running. Run `osprey down` before `osprey build` when an edit removes a
    service.

    Four sections. Build says whether build/ still matches profile.yml -- the

    here -- and which version of osprey rendered it. Containers is what the
    container runtime reports, not what compose thinks should exist. Endpoints

    Containers are matched by the label a build bakes into them, so a second
    checkout of the same deployment on this host is reported as a second
    checkout instead of being folded in. One limit, stated where it matters: a
    container created before this labelling existed carries no label and can
