"""The ``osprey set`` verb — the one sanctioned CLI write into ``profile.yml``.

Every other lifecycle verb reads the deployment repo's source zone; this one
writes it. The write lands in ``profile.yml`` and nowhere else: ``build/`` is
100% derived, so a CLI edit of the rendered ``build/config.yml`` would be
undone by the next build without ever having reached the file that describes
the deployment. That failure mode — a setting that works until someone
rebuilds — is what having exactly one writer prevents.

The machinery is the build's own write-back
(:func:`~osprey.cli.build_profile_resolve.write_back_cli_overrides`), promoted
rather than reimplemented: comment-preserving round-trip YAML, one atomic
replace of the whole document, ``--set`` key spellings unchanged, and the same
refusal of an ``extends:`` write that materialization makes. A second writer
with its own spelling rules would mean ``osprey set connector=epics`` and
``osprey init --set connector=epics`` landing differently in the same file.

Two shorthands are accepted as key spellings:
``connector=`` (folded into ``config.control_system.type`` by
the shared layering step) and ``epics_gateway=`` (expanded below into the
facility's gateway addresses). Both write the literal dotted keys a reader
would otherwise type by hand, so nothing lands in the profile that only this
command can understand.

    a setting through to build/, then `osprey up` to deploy it.

    KEY is a top-level profile key (provider, model, tier, channel_finder_mode,
