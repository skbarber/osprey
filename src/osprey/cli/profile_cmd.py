"""Profile command group — inspect build profiles, and materialize one.

A build profile is the editable source a deployment owns: the ``profile.yml`` at
its repo root plus the data tree and convention directories beside it. This
group holds the read-only verbs that act on that source, kept separate from
``osprey build``, which consumes a profile and renders ``build/`` from it.

The write half lives elsewhere by design: ``osprey init`` creates the deployment
repo (through :func:`_materialize_profile_directory` here, which is the one
function in this module that writes anything) and ``osprey set`` edits the
profile.

``osprey validate`` is the top-level spelling of ``profile validate``, and the
check both run is :func:`osprey.cli.validate_cmd.check_profile_file` — one
implementation, because the only thing that differs between the spellings is
whether the target is required. ``presets`` is the other end of the same rule:
:func:`echo_preset_names` here is also what ``osprey init --list-presets``
prints.

Usage:
    osprey profile presets
    osprey profile validate ~/deployments/als-assistant
