"""Templates and render contexts for the ``osprey scaffold`` verbs.

Scaffolding emits generated files into a deployment repo — a CI pipeline, a
post-deploy health check, a systemd unit and its boot hook — and every one of
them is a Jinja template under ``osprey/templates/deploy/``. This module owns
three things the verbs need and nothing else: which template a platform
selects, what context each template expects, and how to turn a profile into
that context.

The split matters because the templates are held to a byte-for-byte golden
(``tests/deployment/goldens/``). Layout decisions — column alignment, comment
wording, divider widths — belong to the templates; the facts a facility supplies
belong here, where they can be derived once and tested directly.

Nearly every input is a profile fact. Deployment coordinates come from the
``deploy:`` block via
:func:`osprey.cli.build_profile_deploy.parse_deploy_block`; everything else is
read from the profile proper. The exceptions are the handful of values a
profile cannot know — the repo's directory name, and, for the systemd unit, the
two absolute paths that describe the machine the unit will run on — and each
one is passed in at emission time rather than guessed at here.

BOOT_HOOK_OUTPUT_NAME: str = "osprey-boot-hook.sh"

#: How long systemd may wait for ``osprey up -d``. A oneshot gets 90 seconds by

#: How long the crontab job waits for the hook to become readable — in practice
#: how long the home may take to arrive — and, separately, how long the hook

#: the messy one, a site power event with the filer coming up after the compute
#: host, where the home can be minutes late and giving up recreates the silent
#: dead stack the hook exists to prevent. Ten minutes of a sleeping shell costs
#: nothing; a hook that waits past that holds a cron slot open on a host nobody
#: is watching.
BOOT_HOOK_TOTAL_WAIT_SEC: int = 600

#: for the home is the thing that has not arrived yet. Written before any wait,

#: at all — the one question a mail that never came cannot answer. ``$(id -u)``
#: is expanded by the shell that runs the line, so the same spelling serves the
#: crontab and the script.
#:
#: A directory rather than a bare file, because ``/tmp`` is world-writable and
#: the name is predictable: appending to a file there follows a symlink any
#: local user could have planted, turning the log into an append to a file of
#: their choosing, as the deploying account. Both writers create the directory
#: with mode 700 and use it only if it is a real directory they own — otherwise

#: The CI-only variable holding the deploy host's SSH private key. Fixed rather

#: sibling to key off, which is what lets the pipeline and a laptop run the
#: same commands with no flags.
#: ``VERIFY_PATH`` is the single spelling of the health check's destination —
#: the engine derives its output path from it, and ``test_scaffold_ci`` asks
#: every reader (engine, rendered pipeline, init, post-up hook) about the file
#: that was actually written, so the spellings cannot drift apart in silence.
#: ``BOOT_HOOK_PATH`` is the same idea one directory over: the hook's header
#: prints the ``@reboot`` crontab line an operator pastes, and that line is this
#: path under the repo root, so the spelling the script shows and the spelling
#: the emitter writes to have to be one constant.
