"""Templates and render contexts for ``osprey scaffold ci``.

The scaffolding verb emits two files into a deployment repo — a CI pipeline and
a post-deploy health check — and both are Jinja templates under
``osprey/templates/deploy/``. This module owns three things the verb needs and
nothing else: which template a platform selects, what context each template
expects, and how to turn a profile into that context.

The split matters because the templates are held to a byte-for-byte golden
(``tests/deployment/goldens/``). Layout decisions — column alignment, comment
wording, divider widths — belong to the templates; the facts a facility supplies
belong here, where they can be derived once and tested directly.

Every input is a profile fact. Deployment coordinates come from the ``deploy:``
block via :func:`osprey.cli.build_profile_deploy.parse_deploy_block`; everything
else is read from the profile proper. The only value that is not a profile fact
is the project name, which is the facility repo's directory name and therefore
known only at emission time.
