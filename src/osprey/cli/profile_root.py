"""Profile-root discovery — the anchor every profile-relative path resolves against.

A positional profile file is one of two things: a facility's own profile, or a
persona *delta* living in that profile's ``personas/`` directory. The two
anchor differently — a delta's ``data:``, convention dirs, ``.env`` and hash
material all belong to the profile root one level up, never to ``personas/``
itself — so the distinction has to be made once, in one place, rather than
re-derived by each consumer.

The trigger is deliberately narrow: the file's parent directory is named
``personas`` **and** a ``profile.yml`` sits beside that directory. One level,
no upward walk. A walk would quietly capture unrelated files (a profile passed
from a scratch directory that happens to sit under a ``personas`` ancestor) and
anchor them somewhere the caller never named; the narrow predicate leaves every
other path — including the bare temp-file profiles tests build — standalone,
with its own parent as root and no further requirements.

A file inside ``personas/`` whose root is missing is an error rather than a
standalone build: it is a delta, so building it alone would silently produce a
profile missing everything the root was meant to supply.

    The manifest-anchored counterpart of :func:`resolve_profile_root`: it starts
    from a *project* rather than a profile file, following
    ``build_args.profile_path_abs`` — the path ``osprey build`` actually
    resolved — and then anchoring it the way the build does, so a project built
    from a persona delta reports the root one level above ``personas/`` rather
    than the delta's own directory.

    Callers ask the same question for different reasons, and the one thing they
    genuinely disagree on is whether the recorded profile file still has to be
    *there*, which ``require_profile_file`` makes explicit:

    * ``True`` for a caller acting on the profile — moving an artifact into it,
      reading a persona delta out of it. A directory that no longer holds a
      profile would otherwise be reported as the root and every file under it
      as individually missing: one problem told as several, none of them the
      real one.
    * ``False`` for a caller answering "where *would* this project's secrets
      live", which an operator being offered a place to put a secret needs
      answered even when the profile file is momentarily absent.

    ``require_profile_file=False`` deliberately does not make this a check a
    caller about to *write* unattended can lean on; that caller owes the
    stronger question separately. This resolver stays a pure path resolution and
    answers no question about whether writing there is a good idea.

    :param require_profile_file: Whether the recorded profile file must exist.
