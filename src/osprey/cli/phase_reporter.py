"""Phase reporting for the OSPREY lifecycle verbs.

Lifecycle verbs (``init``, ``build``, ``up``, ``restart``, ``down``, ``reset``)
report progress as a short sequence of phases rendered as plain sequential
lines on stdout: ``→ title`` when a phase starts, ``  ✓ title (elapsed)`` when
it ends, ``  · name`` for sub-steps, with an optional ``  group`` header line
opening a named run of steps (which then sit one step deeper). Those lines are
the permanent record on every path, terminal or not, and nothing rewrites them
once printed.

On a terminal the lines carry the CLI's theme, assigned by role rather than
per line: the phase arrow anchors in the theme's primary, group headers in its
subheader, and everything that is *over* — durations, closed ``✓`` lines —
drops to dim, so the open phase and any warning are the brightest things on
screen. The words never change: styles ride on text segments
(:meth:`PhaseReporter.emit_segments`), and off a terminal the segments print
unstyled, byte-identical to what these lines have always been.

On a terminal :class:`LiveReporter` adds a live region *underneath* that record:
the open phase repainted with a spinner and a ticking elapsed, and a row per
service while a build runs (see :mod:`osprey.cli.live_render`). The region is
decoration over the same lines -- it is transient, it never replaces a line, and
switching it off leaves exactly the plain-line output. Off a terminal the same
parsed build state drives append-only heartbeat lines instead, so a quarter-hour
build is never silent either way.

The active reporter is a module-level singleton (the same pattern as
``styles.console``): verbs call :func:`install_reporter` at entry, helpers deep
in the call stack reach it through :func:`current_reporter`. The default is a
quiet :class:`NullReporter`, so helper calls are safe before any verb installs.
