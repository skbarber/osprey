"""Headless agent query command for the OSPREY CLI.

Provides ``osprey query <prompt>`` — a read-only, non-interactive way to send
a prompt to the project's configured agent and report the result.  Writes are
blocked at the SDK level via ``disallowed_tools`` (see
``agent_runner.read_only_disallowed_tools``): the project's MCP write tools
(from ``hook_config.json``), the built-in write/exec/network tools (``Bash``,
``Write``, ``Edit``, ...), and every approval-required MCP action declared in
the server registry (e.g. ``mcp__ariel__entry_create``,
``mcp__python__execute_file``).  This matters because the runner uses
``permission_mode=bypassPermissions``, under which the interactive allow/deny
permission layer is inert, so ``disallowed_tools`` is the sole write guard.

What it queries is the deployment's ``build/`` — the render, found the way
every repo-scoped verb finds its deployment: walk up from the working directory
to the nearest ``profile.yml``, or start from ``--repo``. Nothing is re-rendered
here, so a profile edited since the last build is reported as a warning and the
query runs against the build as it stands; the one refusal is having nothing
rendered to query at all. That is the same bargain ``osprey chat`` strikes, and
for the same reason: a query is read-only and ends with the command, so being
blocked helps nobody, while not being told would let a script answer from an
older render without ever saying so.

Exit codes
----------
0   Agent run completed; all expected MCP servers connected and no error flag.
1   Agent run completed but verdict failed (server missing, error result, or
    budget cap hit).
2   Infrastructure / usage error that prevented the run from starting at all
    (no build, SDK not installed, provider not configured).

    The SECRETS zone is at the repo root while the render is under ``build/``,
    so the env chain and the ``config.yml`` this verb needs do not live in one
    directory — and the runner's own overlay
    (``osprey.build.claude_code_resolver._env_lookup``) looks beside the config
    it was handed. Without this the provider secret would simply not be found
    and the query would authenticate as whatever the ambient shell exported.

    The chain is loaded in ascending precedence — ``.env.shared`` then ``.env``,
    each with ``override=True`` — so the host-local file wins over the committed
    defaults, and both win over a stale shell export. That is the precedence
    every other launch path applies. Every key is copied, not a declared subset:
    the agent expands ``.mcp.json`` ``${VAR}`` references (Channel Access
    addressing among them) out of this environment, so a narrowed copy would
    silently mis-address the control system rather than fail.
