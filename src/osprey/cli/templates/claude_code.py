    requests. ``None`` when the tree is outside the home directory, where the

    """Pick the interpreter OSPREY-runtime processes launch with.

    Every OSPREY-runtime launch site takes this one value: ``.mcp.json`` server
    commands, framework hook commands, and the registry's
    ``{current_python_env}`` substitution. All of them ``import osprey``, so the
    single hard requirement is that the result has ``osprey`` importable.

    It is *derived* from the filesystem, never read from config. A path recorded
    in a config file is a snapshot of one machine and goes stale the moment the
    project is moved, remounted, or rebuilt elsewhere — every MCP server then
    fails to launch. Ending that failure mode is the point of this role split.

    The project's own ``.venv`` wins when the project has one: ``osprey build``
    installs ``osprey`` into it, and a command pointing inside the build output
    keeps working when the framework tree that built it is moved or deleted.
    Without one, the generating interpreter is used — whatever process is
    rendering this is running OSPREY, so ``osprey`` is importable there by
    definition.

    The venv is not always beside the tree being written. A repo's build renders
    into a staging directory and swaps that tree into ``build/`` by rename, while
    the venv is created directly at ``build/.venv`` — its final path, because a
    virtual environment records its own absolute location in every console-script
    shebang — and joins the staged tree only as part of the swap. A caller
    rendering somewhere other than where the result will run passes
    *runtime_venv_dir* to name the venv's real home.

    ``project_root_override`` alone means the artifact is being rendered *for*
    another machine, typically a container's ``/app/<project>``. A local
    ``.venv`` is then neither the interpreter that will exist at run time nor
    probeable from here, so the generating interpreter is the only honest answer.
    It is a weaker signal than *runtime_venv_dir*: an override may equally be a
    local path one level up from the render, which is why a caller that knows
    where the venv lives says so and is believed.

    Args:
        project_dir: Project directory on the filesystem being rendered from.

    Shipping a hook through the ``hooks/`` channel copies it into

    is the declaration that does — a config key, so it resolves through the same

    deltas can override it and the resolved profile is the single source. It is

    The wiring is strictly additive. Nothing here can remove or alter a

    filled, and a declaration naming a built-in hook file is refused outright so
    the framework stays the only writer of its own wiring. Claude Code runs
