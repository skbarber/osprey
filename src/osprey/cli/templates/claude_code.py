#: Tools OSPREY denies outright in every generated ``.claude/settings.json``.
#:
#: This is the interactive permission layer's hard floor: entries land in
#: ``permissions.deny``, which Claude Code refuses without ever offering an
#: approval prompt. ``Bash`` and ``Edit`` are the two that matter most — they
#: are the unmediated shell-out and unmediated file-patch escape hatches around
#: every other control the profile installs.
#:
#: Three consumers share this one definition, and they must not fork:
#:
#: * ``settings.json.j2`` renders it, in this order, into ``permissions.deny``
#:   (minus anything a facility lists under ``permissions.remove_deny``). It
#:   arrives there as the ``deny_defaults`` context key, written by
#:   :func:`config_derived_context` so BOTH render paths carry it.
#: * The build lint checks that every write-capable built-in is either denied
#:   here or gated by a ``PreToolUse`` hook rule.
#: * ``tests/agent_runner/test_write_tools.py`` guards that the headless
#:   read-only floor is never more permissive than this interactive one.
#:
#: Order is load-bearing only in that it fixes the rendered array's order;
#: appending is always safe, reordering churns every built project's diff.

    """Pick the interpreter OSPREY-runtime processes launch with.

    Every OSPREY-runtime launch site takes this one value: ``.mcp.json`` server
    commands, framework hook commands, and the registry's
    ``{current_python_env}`` substitution. All of them ``import osprey``, so the
    single hard requirement is that the result has ``osprey`` importable.

    It is *derived* from the filesystem, never read from config. A path recorded
    in a config file is a snapshot of one machine and goes stale the moment the
    project is moved, remounted, or rebuilt elsewhere — every MCP server then
    fails to launch. Ending that failure mode is the point of this role split.

    The project's own ``.venv`` wins when the project has one: ``osprey build``
    installs ``osprey`` into it, and a command pointing inside the build output
    keeps working when the framework tree that built it is moved or deleted.
    Without one, the generating interpreter is used — whatever process is
    rendering this is running OSPREY, so ``osprey`` is importable there by
    definition.

    The venv is not always beside the tree being written. A repo's build renders
    into a staging directory and swaps that tree into ``build/`` by rename, while
    the venv is created directly at ``build/.venv`` — its final path, because a
    virtual environment records its own absolute location in every console-script
    shebang — and joins the staged tree only as part of the swap. A caller
    rendering somewhere other than where the result will run passes
    *runtime_venv_dir* to name the venv's real home.

    ``project_root_override`` alone means the artifact is being rendered *for*
    another machine, typically a container's ``/app/<project>``. A local
    ``.venv`` is then neither the interpreter that will exist at run time nor
    probeable from here, so the generating interpreter is the only honest answer.
    It is a weaker signal than *runtime_venv_dir*: an override may equally be a
    local path one level up from the render, which is why a caller that knows
    where the venv lives says so and is believed.

    Args:
        project_dir: Project directory on the filesystem being rendered from.
        project_root_override: Runtime project root when it differs from
            *project_dir*, e.g. a container mount point.

            will launch from, when that is not *project_dir*. Passing it asserts

    """Every matcher that shares *tool*'s policy unit: same server, same gate.

    Two matchers belong to one policy unit when they come from the same server
    **instance** — the same ``mcp__<server>__`` prefix, after clone rewriting,
    so a ``python2`` clone is its own unit — and are gated by exactly the same
    PreToolUse hooks. Past that point the permission layer has no way to tell
    them apart: the hooks, not the prompt, are what actually decides each call,
    and they run identically for both.

    WHY the unit has to move together. The writes-off / mixed render pulls
    these matchers out of ``ask`` and the rescue puts back, via ``allow``, the
    ones an enabled agent hard-requires. But ``requires_ask_tools`` is an honest
    declaration of what an agent calls, not of what shares its gate: the
    pyat-specialist names ``mcp__python__execute`` and genuinely never calls
    ``mcp__python__execute_file``, though both run arbitrary Python through the
    same kernels behind the same writes-check + approval pair. Promoting only
    the declared half would leave the other pulled from ``ask`` and in no list
    at all — which is not a policy but a fall-through to the SDK's interactive
    ``can_use_tool`` prompt, the very prompt this block exists to close.
    Splitting the pair reopens it.

    # approval prompt even when the hook returns deny (observed under

    # (it has a legitimate readonly path), so instead it is pulled OUT of
    # permissions.ask — with no static ask entry, the writes_check hook's deny
    # on a readwrite execute stands alone and blocks the call before the prompt.
    #
    # Generalized over FRAMEWORK_SERVERS rather than hardcoded per server name:
    # any hooks_pre rule gated by _WRITES_CHECK is a hardware/state write and
    # defaults to a hard deny (covers controls' channel_write and the bluesky
    # queue's arming tools automatically, plus any future write server with no code
    # change here). python's execute is the one documented exception — it
    # accepts both read_only and write_access kernels, so it is pulled into
    # remove_ask instead (see docstring above); every other writes-check-gated
    # tool is presumed pure-write and denied outright. WHICH templates are
    # read/write-mixed is the registry's call (MIXED_READ_WRITE_TEMPLATES), not
    # this renderer's: the rendered hook config and the MCP audit middleware
    # classify off that same entry, and a second spelling here is how the
    # three would drift.
    #
    # Write posture is per target, so the render is three-way rather than two:
    #
    # * NO target may write — the kill switch above, unchanged. One static deny
    #   is correct because the tool is illegal wherever the session points.
    # * EVERY target may write — nothing rendered, unchanged.
    # * The targets DISAGREE — the deny cannot be static, because the same tool
    #   is legal on one target and refused on the other and settings.json is
    #   rendered once, before any session picks a target. So the render steps
    #   aside: every writes-check-gated matcher is pulled from `ask` and none is
    #   denied, and the runtime carries it per call in three places —
    #   osprey_writes_check (stage 1 the session posture, stage 2 the active
    #   target's posture), the approval hook's defer, and, for the lane-addressed
    #   `queue_*` tools that stage 2 deliberately skips, the lane-bound posture
    #   re-read inside the bluesky queue tools themselves. Dropping the `ask` is
    #   the load-bearing half: a static ask entry left in settings.json would
    #   reopen the can_use_tool prompt none of those three can suppress (the SDK
    #   aggregates any-ask-wins), and an operator would be prompted to approve a
    #   write the target's posture forbids.
    #
    # The postures come from `session_posture`, which yields both targets only
    # on a deployment that renders the switch and otherwise yields the built
    # connector's own posture alone. Looping CONTROL_TARGETS here instead would
    # call a deployment mixed on the strength of a target no session can select

    Shipping a hook through the ``hooks/`` channel copies it into

    is the declaration that does — a config key, so it resolves through the same

    filled, and a declaration naming a built-in hook file is refused outright so
    the framework stays the only writer of its own wiring. Claude Code runs

#: what makes ``remove_deny: ["Bash"]`` a build failure unless something else
#: actually gates the tool.

    """Refuse to build a profile that can write with no gate.

    Every write-capable built-in (:data:`_WRITE_CAPABLE_BUILTINS`) must be
    gated in one of two ways: hard-denied in the rendered ``permissions.deny``
    floor, OR matched by a ``PreToolUse`` hook rule. Either is accepted, and the
    distinction is load-bearing: Claude Code resolves permissions ``deny`` > ``ask``
    > ``allow``, so a hook ``allow`` can never override a ``deny``. Denying
    ``Write``/``MultiEdit``/``NotebookEdit`` outright would therefore permanently
    block legitimate memory writes (Write/MultiEdit to the Claude memory files)
    and artifact notebook edits (NotebookEdit to the agent-data tree). The
    memory-guard ``PreToolUse`` rule is what legitimately gates them instead —
    allowing the good paths and denying the rest — so the lint takes a matcher as
    sufficient. ``Bash`` and ``Edit`` have no such legitimate path and are gated
    by :data:`DENY_DEFAULTS`; the lint is what makes removing them from that
    floor via ``claude_code.permissions.remove_deny`` a build failure rather than
    a silent widening.

    An empty rendered deny floor is itself the hazard this guards against: a
    context missing ``deny_defaults`` renders an EMPTY ``permissions.deny`` array
    silently (a settings.json that looks whole but denies nothing). With an empty
    floor, a write-capable tool passes only if a ``PreToolUse`` rule still gates
    it; if none does, the build is refused rather than shipping an ungated writer.

    **What a matcher does and does not prove.** The lint checks that a covering
    rule EXISTS; it cannot check that the hook behind it ever refuses anything.
    A ``PreToolUse`` hook that exits 0 without emitting a ``permissionDecision``
    falls through to the normal permission flow — i.e. it allows — and one that
    exits non-zero (or fails to launch) is a non-blocking error that also lets
    the call proceed. The framework hooks OSPREY wires emit an explicit
    ``permissionDecision``, so a :data:`_MATCHER_FRAMEWORK` matcher is a real
    gate. A matcher the profile itself declares under
    ``claude_code.hooks.PreToolUse`` is not inspected at all, so it satisfies the
    lint while proving only that a script runs — which is why a tool gated by
    nothing but a profile-declared matcher is allowed through with a build-time
    warning rather than silently. (Refusing outright was considered and rejected:
    no framework hook matches ``Bash`` or ``Edit``, and ``deny`` outranks
    ``allow``, so refusing would make a facility-gated shell unbuildable by any
    means rather than merely loud.)

    Args:
        ctx: The render context, carrying the rendered deny floor
            (``deny_defaults`` + ``facility_permissions``) and the PreToolUse

        fw_pre_rules: The framework PreToolUse rules just computed for this
            render, before they are written into ``ctx``.

    It also carries one guard that is not about the built-ins at all: the
