"""Service injectors — wire deploy-time containers into a built project.

Each injector copies a bundled compose template into ``<project>/services/``,
writes the matching ``services.<name>`` block into ``config.yml`` (and
registers it in ``deployed_services``), and prints a post-build hint. The
injectors pair 1:1 with the service dataclasses in
:mod:`osprey.cli.build_profile_schema` (``DispatchConfig``, ``BlueskyConfig``,
``BlueskyWebConfig``, ``VAConfig``, ``NextcloudBridgeProfileConfig``,
``GChatBridgeProfileConfig``) plus ``VAArchiverConfig``, whose block lives in
:mod:`osprey.cli.build_profile_archiver`.
``_copy_service_templates`` / ``_inject_profile_services`` handle the framework

       ``deployed_services``.
    3. Print a post-build hint (deploy-time seed, minted password, what the
       recorder waits for).

    A two-service injector like :func:`_inject_dispatch`, and paired for the
    same reason: a store nothing writes to and a recorder with nowhere to write
    are each half a feature. They are deployed together and the recorder's
    compose template health-gates on the store.

    Must run *after* :func:`_inject_va`, which is what puts
    ``virtual_accelerator`` into ``deployed_services`` — the recorder template
    reads that membership to decide whether it can reuse the VA's image and
    address the IOC in-network, or must be told both from the environment.

    The connection block the agent reads (``archiver.mongodb_archiver.*``) and
    the archive's shape knobs (``va_archiver.*``) are deliberately NOT written
    here: they come from :func:`~osprey.cli.build_profile_archiver.va_archiver_config_overrides`
    on the ordinary config-override path, which an attached project reaches and
    this injector does not.
