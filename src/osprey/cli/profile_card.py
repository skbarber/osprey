"""The composition card ``osprey init`` prints under its report.

One glance at what the deployment that was just materialized consists of,
before anything is built or started: who can sign in and with what rights,
what the agent runs on, what machine it talks to, and what else runs beside
it. Everything on the card is read off the resolved
:class:`~osprey.cli.build_profile_model.BuildProfile` (plus the emitted
persona deltas), so the card is a pure function of the profile — a build with
no web tier simply has no ``web terminal`` group, and a profile that declares
no extra services has no ``services`` group. Nothing here probes the host or
the container runtime.

The card is echo-class: it is part of what ``init`` owes its operator, so it
prints under every reporter, through
:meth:`~osprey.cli.phase_reporter.PhaseReporter.echo_segments` — styled on a
terminal, byte-identical to its plain rendering through a pipe. The one
derivation feeds both the printer and :func:`format_profile_card`, the
plain-text twin the tests pin, so the card an operator reads cannot differ
from the card a test reads (:mod:`osprey.cli.summary_card`'s precedent).
