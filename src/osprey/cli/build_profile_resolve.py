"""Multi-source profile resolution: preset / file + overlays + ``--set``.

The entry point ``osprey init``'s materialization and ``osprey validate`` call.
Picks the base layer
(bundled preset or on-disk file), deep-merges override files and ``--set``
values over it, then hands the assembled raw dict to ``extends`` resolution and
:func:`osprey.cli.build_profile_load._parse_profile`. Also owns the ``--set``
mini-parser, the top-level shorthand keys (model selection plus ``connector``)
whose explicit use is recorded in the build manifest, and the guard that keeps
a ``--set config.*`` path from quietly losing to — or quietly clobbering — the
literal dotted key some other layer spells for the same place.

The profile is the source of truth, so an explicit override *is* a profile edit:
:func:`write_back_cli_overrides` turns ``osprey set``'s pairs into a
comment-preserving edit of the repo's own ``profile.yml``, which the ordinary
resolution path then reads back like any other profile content. Nothing is
layered at invocation time and thrown away afterwards.

        overrides: ``-O`` files, deep-merged in declaration order. Nothing in
            the shipped CLI passes them: ``osprey init -O`` layers at
            materialization instead (see :func:`merge_cli_overrides`), so this
            is API surface, not a live path.
        set_pairs: The ``osprey set`` pairs — the only argument its one
            production caller passes.
        tier: Written as the profile's ``tier:`` key. Caller-less for the same
            reason as *overrides*.

    Returns:
        The dotted key paths written, in write order; empty when there was
        nothing to write.

    Raises:
        BuildProfileError: If an override file is missing, unreadable, or not a
            YAML mapping, or a ``--set`` pair is malformed.
        click.UsageError: If a layer sets ``extends``, which a materialized
            profile cannot have — the same refusal materialization makes, so the
            same override file is answered the same way on every build.
