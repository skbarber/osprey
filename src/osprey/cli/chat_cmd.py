"""The ``osprey chat`` verb — talk to this deployment's agent.

Chat is the product's first-class verb: everything else in the lifecycle exists
so that this one starts an agent wired to the right control system, with the
right provider, against the right facility knowledge.

What it launches is ``build/`` **as it was built**. The render is where the
agent's own materials live — ``config.yml``, ``.mcp.json``, the ``.claude/``
tree — so that directory is the working directory the agent CLI is handed, and
the CLI treats its working directory as the project root. Nothing is rendered
here: ``osprey build`` owns rendering, and a chat that quietly re-rendered first
would mean the thing an operator talked to was never the thing ``osprey up``
would deploy.

That makes drift a *warning* rather than a refusal. A start verb refuses on
drift because a stack deployed from a half-finished edit outlives the command
that started it; a chat session is read-oriented and ends when the operator
closes it, so being told "the profile has moved on since this build" is the
useful thing, and being blocked is not. Drift's one refusal is having nothing
to launch at all — no ``build/``, no chat.

    The SECRETS zone is at the repo root while the render is under ``build/``,

    directory. This overlay is what closes that gap *before* the provider spec
    is resolved: a custom provider's ``base_url: ${ARGO_PROD_URL}`` is expanded
    at spec-resolution time, and the value it expands from is a chain key.

    The chain is loaded in ascending precedence — ``.env.shared`` then ``.env``,
    each with ``override=True`` — so the host-local file wins over the committed
    defaults, and both win over a stale shell export. That is the same
    local-wins precedence every other launch path applies. Every key is copied,
    not a declared subset — the agent CLI expands ``.mcp.json`` ``${VAR}``
    references (Channel Access addressing among them) out of this environment,
    so a narrowed copy would silently mis-address the control system rather
    than fail.

    Copying everything is not the same as *honoring* everything. The invariant
    on both paths out of this overlay is one of provenance: ``.env`` cannot
    introduce or change a backend-selection var, while the inherited shell
    environment is the operator's own and is left alone. With a provider
    configured, ``inject_provider_env`` scrubs ``MANAGED_ENV_VARS`` and
    re-injects them from the resolved spec; with none configured, the caller
    reverts them to their pre-overlay values (see

    Sets ``OSPREY_CONFIG``, resets the config cache, then offers every
    registered server the chance to start; each server's ``auto_launch_checker``
    decides whether it actually does.

    Each companion that starts runs in a daemon thread in **this** process, so
    it shares this process's web credentials. For every one that starts,
    :func:`osprey.interfaces.web_auth.mint_and_announce` settles the operator
    secret once (idempotent) and returns a per-companion ``?token=`` login URL
    carrying it — the operator's only way past that companion's auth
    middleware, and what this function returns in place of a bare URL.

    Two process-wide steps frame that loop.

    **Before it, the settled web-terminal port is published as
    ``OSPREY_WEB_PORT``**, because that is what names the browser session
    cookie. :func:`~osprey.interfaces.common_middleware.session_cookie_name`
    appends the port to the cookie's base name so that two OSPREY servers on one
    host — one origin, as far as a browser that ignores ports is concerned — do
    not overwrite each other's session; with no port published, every companion
    here falls back to the bare base name and collides with any other OSPREY
    server on the host that fell back too. One name for all of them is the right
    answer rather than one per companion: every companion in this process shares
    a single credential holder and a single session map, so a browser that signs
    in at any one of them is signed in at all of them. The *terminal's* port is
    the one to publish because that is what ``OSPREY_WEB_PORT`` already means to
    its other readers — the agent's panel tools and MCP helpers resolve the web
    terminal through it — so naming a companion's port there would misdirect
    them. An already-published value wins: the per-user container's compose sets
    it to the port that container really listens on.

    **After it, :func:`~osprey.interfaces.web_auth.close_env_carriers` pops both
    credential carriers back out of ``os.environ``.** ``mint_and_announce``
    re-publishes the operator secret on every call, and the last call in the
    loop has no app construction behind it to close the carrier again — each
    companion's ``create_app`` runs in its own daemon thread and calls
    ``close_env_carriers`` whenever it happens to finish, so which carriers
    survive the loop is otherwise a matter of thread timing. Closing them here
    makes the end state deterministic: this process serves and spawns with
    neither credential in its environment. The agent child never depended on
    them anyway — :func:`chat` builds its environment from
    :func:`~osprey.agent_runner.clean_env.build_base_child_env`, which drops
    both names, and takes the panel token it re-adds straight from the
    credential holder.

    # overlay on the parent's. The panel token is then re-added explicitly: the
    # agent's MCP panel tools and the panel/approval hooks it spawns
    # legitimately need it to make panel-tier calls to those companions.
    # Nothing re-adds the terminal secret; a child that needs one mints its own.

    # The value comes from the credential HOLDER, not from os.environ, where by
    # design there is nothing left to read: _launch_companion_servers closes
    # both carriers before it returns. The holder is the same object those
    # companions authenticate against and cannot race with the daemon threads
    # they run in. Gated on a companion having actually started, so a session
    # with no panel host to call hands the child no credential at all.
