"""The ``osprey chat`` verb — talk to this deployment's agent.

Chat is the product's first-class verb: everything else in the lifecycle exists
so that this one starts an agent wired to the right control system, with the
right provider, against the right facility knowledge.

What it launches is ``build/`` **as it was built**. The render is where the
agent's own materials live — ``config.yml``, ``.mcp.json``, the ``.claude/``
tree — so that directory is the working directory the agent CLI is handed, and
the CLI treats its working directory as the project root. Nothing is rendered
here: ``osprey build`` owns rendering, and a chat that quietly re-rendered first
would mean the thing an operator talked to was never the thing ``osprey up``
would deploy.

That makes drift a *warning* rather than a refusal. A start verb refuses on
drift because a stack deployed from a half-finished edit outlives the command
that started it; a chat session is read-oriented and ends when the operator
closes it, so being told "the profile has moved on since this build" is the
useful thing, and being blocked is not. Drift's one refusal is having nothing
to launch at all — no ``build/``, no chat.

    The SECRETS zone is at the repo root while the render is under ``build/``,
    so the env chain and the ``config.yml`` this verb needs do not live in one
    directory. This overlay is what closes that gap *before* the provider spec
    is resolved: a custom provider's ``base_url: ${ARGO_PROD_URL}`` is expanded
    at spec-resolution time, and the value it expands from is a chain key.

    The chain is loaded in ascending precedence — ``.env.shared`` then ``.env``,
    each with ``override=True`` — so the host-local file wins over the committed
    defaults, and both win over a stale shell export. That is the same
    local-wins precedence every other launch path applies. Every key is copied,
    not a declared subset — the agent CLI expands ``.mcp.json`` ``${VAR}``
    references (Channel Access addressing among them) out of this environment,
    so a narrowed copy would silently mis-address the control system rather
    than fail.

    Copying everything is not the same as *honoring* everything. The invariant
    on both paths out of this overlay is one of provenance: ``.env`` cannot
    introduce or change a backend-selection var, while the inherited shell
    environment is the operator's own and is left alone. With a provider
    configured, ``inject_provider_env`` scrubs ``MANAGED_ENV_VARS`` and
    re-injects them from the resolved spec; with none configured, the caller
    reverts them to their pre-overlay values (see
    :func:`_restore_managed_env`). What survives either way is the non-managed
    remainder that ``.mcp.json`` expansion needs.
