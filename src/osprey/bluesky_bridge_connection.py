"""Single source of truth for resolving the Bluesky bridge connection.

Two independent OSPREY components talk to the same facility-side Bluesky bridge
and must agree, exactly, on *which* bridge instance and *which* launch token
they are using:

- the Bluesky MCP server (``osprey.mcp_server.bluesky.server_context``), the
  agent's path to the bridge, and
- the operator bluesky-web sidecar (``osprey.interfaces.bluesky_web``), the
  browser's path to the bridge.

If those two ever drift in how they resolve the bridge URL or the launch token
-- a different env-var name, a different config key, a different fallback order
-- the agent and the panel silently arm (or fail to arm) *different* bridge
instances. That is a safety-relevant bug class: the human could approve a
launch in a panel that targets one bridge while the agent's writes-arming
token belongs to another. Keeping the resolution logic here, imported by both,
makes that drift impossible by construction.

This is a top-level leaf module (the precedent is
``osprey.bluesky_tool_names``): it imports **nothing** from
``osprey.mcp_server`` or ``osprey.services`` so both may import it without a
cycle. ``osprey.utils.workspace`` is imported lazily, inside the resolver
functions, only when a config fallback is actually needed.
