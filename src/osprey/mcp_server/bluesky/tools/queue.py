"""MCP tools: the agent's side of the bridge's plan queue.

Execution is two steps, deliberately: ``queue_add`` puts the pinned draft into
the queue (which starts nothing), and ``queue_start`` begins draining it (which
starts a real plan). Splitting them is what lets a human review a composed queue
before
anything moves, and it is why the arming gate sits on *start* rather than on
composition.

``stop_run`` (``tools/stop.py``) completes the halting surface with
``POST /queue/abort`` — the emergency stop for a plan already in motion. It
lives in its own module but shares this one's refusal relay and hint table, so
the two answer the same bridge code the same way.

**Arming.** Two operations can put hardware in motion. Two local safety layers
guard them, both enforced BEFORE any HTTP call — but only the first is carried
everywhere:

1. A write-posture re-read for the control target the BOUND LANE serves, made
   through the one rule every OSPREY write path shares
   (``osprey_connectors.session_store.effective_writes``): the deployment
   ceiling ``control_system.connector.<type>.writes_enabled`` — inheriting the
   deployment-wide ``control_system.writes_enabled`` where that type has no
   block of its own — ANDed with ``is_readonly_run()`` and with the operator's
   per-(session, target) narrowing from the header chip. The ceiling half is
   the same resolver ``ControlSystemConnector._writes_enabled`` reads, so the
   queue agrees with every other write path about which targets a deployment
   arms; the store half can only narrow that, never widen it, and it is what
   lets an operator take one machine out of a session's reach without
   respawning the session. Re-read fresh on every call, never cached, so a
   hook-bypassed invocation carrying a valid launch token is still refused.
   Per target is the point of it: a deployment whose live machine is
   deliberately unarmed still runs plans on its virtual-accelerator lane, and
   the lane a call binds to is what decides which posture applies to it.
2. A client-side launch-token presence check, so an unarmed server refuses
   locally with no network call.

3. A session-target check, on ``queue_add`` and ``queue_start`` only. A
   deployment's plan lane is wired at build time to one control target, while
   an agent session can be switched to the other one at run time
   (``control_target_set``). Queuing or starting a Bluesky PLAN while the two
   disagree would run it against a machine the session is not pointed at. This
   layer is enforced HERE rather than at the bridge because the session target
   is host state: a bridge serves its lane's target and never learns which
   target the session is on. Halting is never gated by it, for the same reason
   it is never gated by the kill switch.

   What that check DOES depends on how many lanes the deployment renders, and
   the lane count is the only branch point (see ``bluesky/lanes.py``):

   * **One lane** — every deployment until ``bluesky.second_lane`` is opted
     into. There is no other lane to route to, so a switched session is refused
     outright: the blanket refusal this module has always carried, unchanged.
   * **Two lanes** — one per control target. The switch stops being a refusal
     and becomes an ADDRESS: the operation is routed to the lane serving the
     session's target, ``queue_add`` returns the lane it bound the item to, and
     ``queue_start`` must name that lane and is refused when it no longer
     matches the active one (a session that switched between the add and the
     start). It still refuses when NO single rendered lane serves the session's
     target, which is a misrendered deployment rather than a switch.

   Both branches come out of one resolved fact — ``LaneSituation.active``, the
   lane whose target equals the session's — so the refusal and the routing
   decision can never drift apart.

``queue_start`` binds its lane FIRST, carries layer 1 for that lane's target
unconditionally, and then delegates the token decision to the bridge: it posts
with its launch token when it holds one and with no token header when it does
not, and the bridge answers ``launch_token_required`` for absence and mismatch
alike. That order is the contract — lane binding, then posture, then token —
and it is forced rather than chosen: there is no target to read a posture for
until the lane is bound, so a two-lane deployment that named no lane hears
``lane_required`` before anything else. Keeping the token verdict in one place
is equally deliberate — a local presence check would let the agent hear a
different answer from the tool than the bridge would have given.

``queue_add`` is armed only *sometimes* — enqueuing onto an idle queue moves
nothing, while enqueuing onto a queue that is already draining hands the item
straight to hardware — so it too binds its lane, reads layer 1 for that lane's
target, and then attaches the launch token to the request only when that target
is armed, leaving the bridge (which alone knows the manager's live state, under
a lock, with a post-add re-check) to decide whether this particular enqueue
needed it. A deployment whose lane is unarmed therefore keeps composing queues
and is refused exactly at the point where composing would become executing.

``queue_stop`` inverts the asymmetry: a plain stop is ungated in every layer
because halting is always allowed, while ``cancel=True`` withdraws a human's
pending halt and is gated like a start — it is the one operation that carries
layer 2. Its layer 1 is the UNION over the targets this deployment's RENDERED
LANES serve, rather than one lane's answer, because a withdrawal is addressed
to whichever lane is actually draining and that lane is found by asking the
bridges, over the network, after this local gate has had to decide. The
per-lane half is layer 2, which is per lane by construction: the launch token
is.

**Refusals are relayed, never rewritten.** Every refusal the bridge issues is
an HTTP 4xx/5xx whose ``detail`` is ``{"code", "detail", ...extras}``, where
``code`` is the machine-readable branch key. These tools surface the bridge's
``code`` as the envelope's ``error_type``, its sentence as the
``error_message``, and the entire detail object — including extras like
``capability``, ``manager_state``, ``revision``, ``plan`` and
``item_left_behind`` — as ``details``. Nothing is reworded or reclassified: a
tool that renamed a refusal would put the agent and the panel on different
vocabularies for the same event. The only envelopes minted here are the three
local refusals (``writes_disabled``, ``launch_token_required``,
``session_target_mismatch``) and a last-resort ``bluesky_bridge_error`` for a
bridge response that carried no structured detail at all.

**No reason-code constants are imported here, and exactly one is spelled out.**
The capability reason codes are defined in
``osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.queue_backend``, which pulls in
``bluesky-queueserver-api`` and the runner wiring; importing it would break this
server's standing invariant of making no bluesky/ophyd/tiled imports (see
``bluesky/server.py``). For every code the bridge mints, these tools never
branch on it — they pass the whole capability record through — so they need no
copy of the vocabulary and cannot drift from it. The one exception is
:data:`REASON_SESSION_TARGET_MISMATCH`, which no bridge can mint because the
session target is host state; its string is spelled here and pinned equal to
``queue_backend``'s constant by a test, so the vocabulary stays single even
though the two layers cannot import each other. The docstrings below name the
codes as prose, for the agent reading them.

def _writes_enabled(lane_target: str | None) -> bool:
    """Fail-closed re-read of the write posture for ONE lane's control target.

    *lane_target* is the target the bound lane declares
    (:attr:`~osprey.mcp_server.bluesky.lanes.Lane.target`), so a deployment that
    renders two lanes gets two answers: arming the virtual accelerator does not
    arm the live machine, and a live machine left unarmed does not stop plans
    running on the simulator.

    ``None`` means NO LANE IS BOUND, and it is defensive rather than reachable
    from a bound lane: ``discover_lanes`` substitutes the deployment baseline
    for a lane whose config block names no target, so a :class:`Lane` never
    yields ``None`` here. It resolves the deployment baseline for the same
    reason ``discover_lanes`` does — that is the target an unlabelled lane
    serves by construction — so a future caller with no lane in hand gets the
    baseline's posture rather than a fail-open read of nothing.

    Asks the ONE rule every OSPREY write path shares,
    :func:`osprey_connectors.session_store.effective_writes`, so the queue's
    arming gate cannot answer differently from the connector's reference
    monitor, the executor's gate or the PreToolUse hook:

        ceiling ∧ not is_readonly_run() ∧ (store entry ≠ sandbox)

    The ceiling is the deployment's own posture, unchanged — the per-type key
    ``control_system.connector.<type>.writes_enabled``, inheriting the
    deployment-wide ``control_system.writes_enabled`` where a type has no block.
    The read-only run is ANDed in because a sandbox session must be refused here
    as it is at the connector rather than only by the hook chain. The third term
    is the operator's per-(session, target) narrowing from the header chip,
    keyed on ``OSPREY_POSTURE_SESSION`` and indexed by THIS LANE's target: it
    can only narrow the ceiling, and a process nobody stamped a session key into
    does not consult it at all. Enforcing it here rather than at spawn is what
    lets an operator take one machine out of a live session's reach without
    respawning the session mid-conversation.

    Deliberately NOT cached on the BridgeContext singleton — the whole point is
    a fresh read on every call, so a hook-bypassed invocation holding a valid
    launch token is still refused.

    The except clause is broad on purpose. Every way this answer can fail to be
    computed — no config, an unreadable one, a resolver meeting a config shape
    nobody anticipated — is a deployment whose posture is unknown, and unknown
    posture must not arm hardware.

    whose queue is actually draining, and finding that lane means asking every
    bridge over the network — after this local gate has already had to decide.
    A deployment with no armed target anywhere can never need to withdraw a
    halt, so refusing there costs nothing; anything else falls through to
    :func:`_refuse_unarmed`, which is per lane by construction because the

    The union is over the targets the RENDERED LANES serve, and nothing else.
    Two wider sets would both be wrong here. Unioning over the target *names*
    would let a target the config never described — ``live`` on a
    virtual-accelerator deployment — inherit the deployment-wide key and arm a
    withdrawal on the only lane there is, the one the operator had explicitly
    unarmed with its own block. Unioning over the targets a *session* could be
    switched to would be a different question again: a halt is addressed to the
    lane whose queue is draining, which is where the hardware is moving rather
    than where the session is pointed, so the session's reach has no bearing on
    it. The lanes are what a withdrawal can possibly land on, so they are what
    this gate asks about. Nothing downstream re-checks: the bridge's stop
    endpoint carries no posture check of its own, so this gate is the whole
    defense.

    Each term is :func:`_writes_enabled`'s whole rule for one target, session
    narrowing included — withdrawing a halt RESUMES motion, so a session that

    """Whether this deployment can execute plans at all. Reaches NO hardware.

    Ask this BEFORE composing a plan you intend to run. A deployment wired to
    a mock connector can list plans, author them, validate them and fill the
    draft, but it cannot execute — and the queue refuses to hold items it
    could never run, so ``queue_add`` fails there rather than at start time.
    Knowing that up front is the difference between telling the human "this
    deployment is browse-only, here is the command that flips it" and
    discovering it after composing a whole plan.

    This is the deployment's execution capability, not the queue's contents —
    use queue_list for the items and the manager's live state.

    Returns:
        JSON ``{"status", "capability"}``. ``status`` is bridge liveness and is
        deliberately independent of capability: a browse-only deployment is a
        healthy deployment, so ``"ok"`` never implies executability.
        ``capability`` is ``{"can_execute", "reason", "detail"}`` —
        ``can_execute`` is the answer, ``reason`` is the machine-readable code
        (``executable``, ``browse_only_connector``, ``unsupported_connector``,
        ``config_unreadable``, ``manager_not_configured``,
        ``manager_unreachable``), and ``detail`` is the operator-facing
        sentence, which for a browse-only deployment names the exact command
        that makes it executable. Relay ``detail`` to the human verbatim.

        On a deployment that renders TWO plan lanes the answer also carries
        ``lanes`` — one entry per lane, each with its ``lane``, ``lane_target``,
        ``status``, its own ``capability``, and ``active``: whether the session
        is currently pointed at that lane's target. Exactly one lane is active
        at a time (none, only if the rendered lanes do not cover the session's
        target, which is a misrendered deployment). ``active_lane`` names it,
        and the top-level ``status``/``capability`` are the ACTIVE lane's, so a
        reader that ignores ``lanes`` still sees the deployment the session is
        actually on. The ``lane``/``lane_target`` inside each capability are the
        bridge's own render-time facts; ``active`` is the one field the host
        adds, because only the host can see the session's target. A lane that
        could not be read at all carries ``error`` instead of a capability —
        one lane's bad news never hides the others.

    Refusals:
        - bluesky_bridge_error / bluesky_bridge_unreachable: the capability
          could not be read. Treat an unreadable capability as CANNOT EXECUTE
          — never assume executability from a failed check. On a two-lane
          deployment this is raised for the ACTIVE lane; an inactive lane that
          cannot be read contributes an ``error`` to its own entry instead of
          hiding the active lane's answer.

@mcp.tool()
async def queue_add(draft_revision: int, lane: str | None = None) -> str:
    """Add the shared plan draft, at a pinned revision, to the queue. Starts NOTHING.

    Step one of two. This queues exactly the draft the human can see in their
    plan panel at revision ``draft_revision`` — never anything you pass here —
    and then stops. Nothing moves until a start: either your ``queue_start`` or
    the human's own start control. Confirm the draft is complete and correct
    with get_draft before adding it.

    Adding is normally unarmed, because an item sitting in an idle queue moves
    nothing. It becomes an arming action when the queue is already draining
    (``manager_state`` running/starting, or autostart observed on): the item
    would then execute with no further human action. In that case the bridge
    requires the launch token, and this tool attaches the token only while
    writes are armed for the control target the bound lane serves —
    ``control_system.connector.<type>.writes_enabled``, inheriting the
    deployment-wide ``control_system.writes_enabled`` where that type has no
    block of its own, re-read fresh on every call, and never armed at all in a
    read-only session. So on a lane whose target is unarmed you can still
    compose a queue, and are refused precisely at the point where adding would
    mean executing. A deployment that arms one target and not the other gets
    that answer per lane, not once for the whole deployment.

    A revision is consumable exactly once. Queuing the same plan twice — a
    repeat plan, a retry — needs a draft edit (set_draft) to mint a new
    revision first; re-adding the spent one is refused, by design, so a
    duplicated call cannot silently double-queue a plan.

    Args:
        draft_revision: The draft revision to queue, as returned by get_draft
            or set_draft. The bridge queues the draft snapshot pinned at this
            exact revision.
        lane: The lane the revision was read from, as ``get_draft``/
            ``set_draft`` report in their own ``lane`` field. A revision number
            alone does NOT identify a draft on a deployment with two lanes:
            each lane's bridge holds its own draft and counts its own
            revisions, so revision 4 exists on both and means two different
            plans. The pin is therefore ``(lane, revision)`` — pass the lane
            you read the revision from and a session that switched in between
            is refused (``lane_mismatch``) instead of silently queueing the
            other machine's draft. Omitted, the add goes to whichever lane the
            session is on now.

    Returns:
        JSON ``{"run_id", "revision", "item", "lane"}`` — ``run_id`` is
        OSPREY's id for the eventual run (use it with get_run / get_run_data
        once it executes), and ``item.item_uid`` is the queue handle for this
        item. ``lane`` is the plan lane the item was queued on, and on a
        deployment with two lanes it is what ``queue_start(lane=...)`` must be
        given: it pins the start to the machine this item was composed for,
        even if the session switches targets in between. A single-lane
        deployment reports its one lane, ``"bluesky"``.

    Refusals (nothing is queued, and the pinned revision stays usable):
        - launch_token_required: the queue is already draining and this add
          needed the launch token. ``details.manager_state`` names the state
          that made it armed. Either this server was not granted a token in
          this deployment, or the token it holds does not match the bridge's —
          hand the add to the operator either way — or this
          server withheld it because the bound lane's target is not armed for
          writes (then arming that target, an operator action, is what unblocks
          it, and the suggestions name the exact key). Neither is
          agent-recoverable, and neither is a config
          edit for you to attempt. If ``details.item_left_behind`` is
          true, an item could NOT be withdrawn and is sitting in an armed queue
          — ``details.item_uid`` names it and a human must deal with it.
        - stale_draft_revision: the draft changed after you pinned it. Re-read
          get_draft and add the revision it reports now.
        - draft_revision_already_launched: this revision was already queued.
          Edit the draft to mint a new revision.
        - unknown_device: a device name in the staged plan is not one this
          worker built, caught before the item was queued rather than as a
          failed run. ``details.available_devices`` lists the names it does
          have when the worker's namespace fits one page; a larger namespace
          reports ``details.available_count`` and
          ``details.available_devices_url`` instead. Read the names with
          list_devices (pass a prefix), then correct the name with set_draft,
          which mints a new revision, and add that one.
        - session_plan_unvalidated / session_plan_not_in_namespace: the plan is
          a session plan with no current passing validation, or its validated
          bytes are not in the worker's namespace. Run validate_plan again.
        - browse_only_connector / unsupported_connector / config_unreadable:
          this deployment cannot execute plans, so the queue holds none.
          ``details.capability.detail`` names the flip; relay it verbatim.
        - manager_not_configured / manager_unreachable / environment_unavailable:
          the manager or its worker environment is not available right now.
        - queue_request_rejected: the manager answered and refused the item.
        - session_target_mismatch: this session is on a control target no plan
          lane in this deployment serves, so the PLAN would run against another
          machine. On a single-lane deployment that is any switch away from the
          baseline; on a two-lane one it means the rendered pair does not cover
          the session's target, which is a deployment problem. Refused before
          the bridge is called. ``details.session_target`` /
          ``details.baseline_target`` name both targets, and ``details.lanes``
          lists what this deployment renders. Switch back with
          control_target_set, or do the work with the control-system tools,
          which follow the session target.

    Three local gates run in this order, and the order is the contract: the

    arm its virtual-accelerator lane while leaving its live lane refused, and

        JSON ``{"started": true, "msg"}`` once the bridge has accepted the
        start — the queue then drains asynchronously (poll queue_list for
        progress and get_run_data for the running item's data). There is no
        other success shape: this tool either arms the queue or refuses.

    Refusals (nothing started):
        - writes_disabled: the control target the named lane serves is not
          armed for writes, or this session is in the read-only sandbox
          posture. Refused before the bridge is called at all, and refused per
          LANE: the other lane may well be startable. Not agent-recoverable;
          the refusal names the exact key an operator would set.
        - launch_token_required: this deployment did not grant the agent a
          launch token, the token it holds does not match the bridge's, or the
          bridge itself has none configured. Not agent-recoverable; contact
          the operator.
        - session_plan_unvalidated / session_plan_not_in_namespace: a plan
          somewhere in the queue is a session plan without a current passing
          validation. One stale plan refuses the whole start, all-or-nothing;
          ``details.plan`` names it. Re-validate it, or remove that item.
        - interrupted_item_in_queue: a plan that already ran and was
          interrupted — aborted, halted or failed — is back at the front of
          the queue. The queue server puts it there rather than discarding it,
          so starting now would re-run something a human stopped.
          ``details.plan``/``details.exit_status`` name it. Not
          agent-recoverable and not retryable: EVERY start is refused while
          that copy is queued, so the operator has to remove it on the BLUESKY
          panel first. Only after that can it be re-staged through the draft
          and enqueued again, if they want it to run on purpose. Tell them what
          is queued; do not choose for them.
        - manager_not_idle: a plan is already running, so there is nothing to
          start. Wait for the queue to drain (poll queue_list), or stop_run to
          halt the plan in motion if that is what the human wants.
        - browse_only_connector / unsupported_connector / config_unreadable:
          this deployment cannot execute plans at all.
        - manager_not_configured / manager_unreachable / environment_unavailable:
          the manager or its worker environment is unavailable.
        - queue_request_rejected: the manager refused the start (e.g. it is
          already running).
        - session_target_mismatch: this session is on a control target that
          this deployment's single plan lane does not serve, so starting would
          run the queue against the other machine. Refused before the bridge is
          called; nothing started. ``details.session_target`` /
          ``details.baseline_target`` name both targets.
        - lane_required (two-lane deployments only): this deployment renders
          two plan lanes and the start named neither. Pass the ``lane`` the
          ``queue_add`` result reported.
        - lane_mismatch (two-lane deployments only): the named lane is not the
          one this session is on — typically because the session switched
          targets after the item was queued. Starting it would drive a machine
          the session has left. ``details.lanes`` shows every lane and which is
          active; switch back with control_target_set, or start the active
          lane's own queue if that is what should run.
        - unknown_bluesky_lane: the named lane is not one this deployment
          renders at all. Never answered from another lane's bridge.

# Tool 5: stop the queue (asymmetric: halting is free, un-halting is armed)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
@mcp.tool()
async def queue_stop(cancel: bool = False) -> str:
    """Stop the queue after the running item finishes — or withdraw a pending stop.

    Deliberately asymmetric, because the two directions are not equally safe.

    A plain stop (``cancel`` false, the default) is ungated everywhere: no
    writes check, no launch token, at this tool and at the bridge. Halting is
    the safe direction and must stay reachable even when the kill switch has
    disabled writes.

    Know its limit before you rely on it: it stops the queue AFTER the running
    item finishes, so a plan already moving hardware keeps going. If someone
    needs THAT stopped now, ``stop_run`` is the tool — it aborts the running
    plan immediately and is ungated for the same reason this one is. Say which
    of the two you are doing rather than letting "stop" cover both.

    ``cancel=True`` is the opposite operation: it WITHDRAWS a stop that a human
    (or you) already requested and lets the queue keep draining toward
    hardware. Reversing someone's halt is an arming action, so it is gated
    twice over locally: the write posture is re-read fresh, and a missing
    launch token is refused here as well, both before any HTTP call — then the
    bridge checks both again. The posture half asks whether ANY lane this
    deployment renders is armed, not whether one lane's is, because a
    withdrawal is addressed to whichever lane is actually draining and that
    lane is found by asking the bridges — after this gate has had to decide.
    The per-lane half is the token, which is per lane already. That local token
    check is MORE than ``queue_start`` does: a tokenless start goes to the
    bridge and relays the bridge's refusal, while a tokenless withdrawal never
    leaves this process. Only withdraw a stop when you know why it was
    requested.

    Args:
        cancel: False (default) requests the stop. True withdraws a pending
            stop, which is an arming action.

    On a deployment with two plan lanes this goes to the lane whose queue is
    actually draining, not to the lane the session happens to be on. A stop is
    about the hardware that is moving, and an operator who switched targets
    mid-run must still be able to halt what they started.

    Returns:
        JSON ``{"stop_pending", "msg"}`` — ``stop_pending`` is true after a
        stop request, false after a withdrawal.

    Refusals:
        - writes_disabled (cancel=True only): no plan lane this deployment
          renders is armed for writes, or this session is in the read-only
          sandbox posture, so a pending stop cannot be withdrawn. A plain stop
          is never refused for this reason.
        - launch_token_required (cancel=True only): no launch token here or at
          the bridge, or the two do not match. This deployment did not grant
          this agent a usable token — ask the operator to withdraw the stop
          from their queue panel instead; never chase the token in config.
        - manager_not_configured / manager_unreachable: the manager could not
          be reached. The queue was NOT stopped — say so plainly; do not report
          an unconfirmed halt as done.
        - queue_request_rejected: the manager refused (e.g. no stop is pending
          to withdraw).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

async def queue_remove(uid: str, lane: str | None = None) -> str:
    """Remove ONE pending item from the queue. Never touches the running plan.

    Removing queued work arms nothing — the item is discarded before it could
    move hardware — so like a plain ``queue_stop`` this carries no writes
    check and no launch token, at this tool and at the bridge. It is
    approval-gated instead: the prompt is where the human decides, which is
    exactly what the queue server wants after an interruption.

    The one situation that REQUIRES this tool: a plan that was aborted,
    halted, or failed comes back at the FRONT of the queue (the queue server
    puts it there so a human can decide), and every ``queue_start`` is refused
    with ``interrupted_item_in_queue`` until that copy is removed. Removing it
    with the ``item_uid`` from that refusal — or from ``queue_list`` — is the
    only way on. To run the plan again afterwards, re-stage it through the
    draft and enqueue it afresh, deliberately; removal alone re-runs nothing.

    To stop a plan already in motion this is the wrong tool — that is
    ``stop_run`` (abort now) or ``queue_stop`` (halt after the running item).

    Args:
        uid: The queue item's ``item_uid``, as ``queue_list`` reports it and
            as ``queue_add`` returned it (``item.item_uid``). This is the
            queue handle, not the OSPREY run id.
        lane: The plan lane holding the item, as ``queue_list``/``queue_add``
            report in their own ``lane`` field. Omitted, the removal goes to
            the lane the session is on now — each lane's manager holds its own
            queue, so on a two-lane deployment pass the lane the uid came
            from.

    Returns:
        JSON ``{"removed": true, "item"}`` — ``item`` is the removed item as
        the manager last held it (``null`` when the manager reported none).

    Refusals (the queue is unchanged):
        - queue_request_rejected: the manager answered and refused — most
          often the uid is not in the queue (already removed, already
          running, or mistyped). Re-read queue_list for what is actually
          pending.
        - manager_not_configured / manager_unreachable: the queue could not
          be reached at all.
