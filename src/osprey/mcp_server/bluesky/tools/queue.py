"""MCP tools: the agent's side of the bridge's plan queue.

Execution is two steps, deliberately: ``queue_add`` puts the pinned draft into
the queue (which starts nothing), and ``queue_start`` begins draining it (which
starts a real plan). Splitting them is what lets a human review a composed queue
before
anything moves, and it is why the arming gate sits on *start* rather than on
composition.

==========================  =================================================
Tool                        Bridge endpoint
==========================  =================================================
queue_status                GET    /health   (capability record)
queue_list                  GET    /queue
queue_add                   POST   /queue/items
queue_start                 POST   /queue/start
queue_stop                  POST   /queue/stop
==========================  =================================================

``stop_run`` (``tools/stop.py``) completes the halting surface with
``POST /queue/abort`` — the emergency stop for a plan already in motion. It
lives in its own module but shares this one's refusal relay and hint table, so
the two answer the same bridge code the same way.

**Arming.** Two operations can put hardware in motion. Two local safety layers
guard them, both enforced BEFORE any HTTP call — but only the first is carried
everywhere:

1. A ``control_system.writes_enabled`` re-read straight from config, mirroring
   ``ControlSystemConnector._writes_enabled``
   (``osprey/connectors/control_system/base.py``) exactly — same key, same
   fail-closed except clause. Re-read fresh on every call, never cached, so a
   hook-bypassed invocation carrying a valid launch token is still refused
   while writes are disabled.
2. A client-side launch-token presence check, so an unarmed server refuses
   locally with no network call.

``queue_start`` carries layer 1 unconditionally, then delegates the token
decision to the bridge: it posts with its launch token when it holds one and
with no token header when it does not, and the bridge answers
``launch_token_required`` for absence and mismatch alike. Keeping that one
verdict in one place is deliberate — a local presence check would let the agent
hear a different answer from the tool than the bridge would have given.
``queue_add`` is armed only *sometimes* — enqueuing onto an idle queue moves
nothing, while enqueuing onto a queue that is already draining hands the item
straight to hardware — so it too carries layer 1 and then attaches the launch
token to the request only when writes are enabled, leaving the bridge (which
alone knows the manager's live state, under a lock, with a post-add re-check)
to decide whether this particular enqueue needed it. A writes-disabled
deployment therefore keeps composing queues and is refused exactly at the point
where composing would become executing. ``queue_stop`` inverts the asymmetry: a
plain stop is ungated in every layer because halting is always allowed, while
``cancel=True`` withdraws a human's pending halt and is gated like a start — it
is the one operation that carries layer 2.

**Refusals are relayed, never rewritten.** Every refusal the bridge issues is
an HTTP 4xx/5xx whose ``detail`` is ``{"code", "detail", ...extras}``, where
``code`` is the machine-readable branch key. These tools surface the bridge's
``code`` as the envelope's ``error_type``, its sentence as the
``error_message``, and the entire detail object — including extras like
``capability``, ``manager_state``, ``revision``, ``plan`` and
``item_left_behind`` — as ``details``. Nothing is reworded or reclassified: a
tool that renamed a refusal would put the agent and the panel on different
vocabularies for the same event. The only envelopes minted here are the two
local refusals (``writes_disabled``, ``launch_token_required``) and a
last-resort ``bluesky_bridge_error`` for a bridge response that carried no
structured detail at all.

**No reason-code constants are imported or hardcoded here.** The capability
reason codes are defined in ``osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.queue_backend``,
which pulls in ``bluesky-queueserver-api`` and the runner wiring; importing it
would break this server's standing invariant of making no bluesky/ophyd/tiled
imports (see ``bluesky/server.py``). These tools never branch on a reason code
— they pass the whole capability record through — so they need no copy of the
vocabulary and cannot drift from it. The docstrings below name the codes as
prose, for the agent reading them.

    and then stops. Nothing moves until a start: either your ``queue_start`` or
    the human's own start control. Confirm the draft is complete and correct

    Adding is normally unarmed, because an item sitting in an idle queue moves
    nothing. It becomes an arming action when the queue is already draining
    (``manager_state`` running/starting, or autostart observed on): the item
    would then execute with no further human action. In that case the bridge

    ``control_system.writes_enabled`` is true — re-read fresh on every call. So
    on a writes-disabled deployment you can still compose a queue, and are
    refused precisely at the point where adding would mean executing.

    A revision is consumable exactly once. Queuing the same plan twice — a
    repeat plan, a retry — needs a draft edit (set_draft) to mint a new
    revision first; re-adding the spent one is refused, by design, so a

# Tool 4: start draining the queue (the arming action)

async def queue_start() -> str:
    """Start draining the queue. THE arming action — real motion follows.

    Step two of two, and the only way execution ever begins: the manager's own
    autostart stays disabled, so every start originates from a deliberate call
    here or from the human's start control. This runs the queue as it stands —
    every pending item, in order, not just the one you added — so read
    queue_list first and be sure the whole queue is what should run.

    The start goes to the bridge behind your approval prompt, carrying this
    server's launch token. ``control_system.writes_enabled`` is re-read fresh
    first — never cached — so a hook-bypassed invocation holding a valid token
    is still refused while writes are off. The bridge then re-verifies the
    token, re-checks every queued session plan's validation, and opens the
    worker environment if needed.

    Returns:
        JSON ``{"started": true, "msg"}`` once the bridge has accepted the
        start — the queue then drains asynchronously (poll queue_list for
        progress and get_run_data for the running item's data). There is no
        other success shape: this tool either arms the queue or refuses.

    Refusals (nothing started):
        - writes_disabled: writes are off in this deployment. Refused before
          the bridge is called at all. Not agent-recoverable; the operator
          must enable writes.
        - launch_token_required: this deployment did not grant the agent a
          launch token, the token it holds does not match the bridge's, or the
          bridge itself has none configured. Not agent-recoverable; contact
          the operator.
        - session_plan_unvalidated / session_plan_not_in_namespace: a plan
          somewhere in the queue is a session plan without a current passing
          validation. One stale plan refuses the whole start, all-or-nothing;
          ``details.plan`` names it. Re-validate it, or remove that item.
        - interrupted_item_in_queue: a plan that already ran and was
          interrupted — aborted, halted or failed — is back at the front of
          the queue. The queue server puts it there rather than discarding it,
          so starting now would re-run something a human stopped.
          ``details.plan``/``details.exit_status`` name it. Not
          agent-recoverable and not retryable: EVERY start is refused while
          that copy is queued, so the operator has to remove it on the BLUESKY
          panel first. Only after that can it be re-staged through the draft
          and enqueued again, if they want it to run on purpose. Tell them what
          is queued; do not choose for them.
        - manager_not_idle: a plan is already running, so there is nothing to
          start. Wait for the queue to drain (poll queue_list), or stop_run to
          halt the plan in motion if that is what the human wants.
        - browse_only_connector / unsupported_connector / config_unreadable:
          this deployment cannot execute plans at all.
        - manager_not_configured / manager_unreachable / environment_unavailable:
          the manager or its worker environment is unavailable.
        - queue_request_rejected: the manager refused the start (e.g. it is
          already running).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
@mcp.tool()
async def queue_stop(cancel: bool = False) -> str:
    """Stop the queue after the running item finishes — or withdraw a pending stop.

    Deliberately asymmetric, because the two directions are not equally safe.

    A plain stop (``cancel`` false, the default) is ungated everywhere: no
    writes check, no launch token, at this tool and at the bridge. Halting is
    the safe direction and must stay reachable even when the kill switch has
    disabled writes.

    Know its limit before you rely on it: it stops the queue AFTER the running
    item finishes, so a plan already moving hardware keeps going. If someone
    needs THAT stopped now, ``stop_run`` is the tool — it aborts the running
    plan immediately and is ungated for the same reason this one is. Say which
    of the two you are doing rather than letting "stop" cover both.

    ``cancel=True`` is the opposite operation: it WITHDRAWS a stop that a human
    (or you) already requested and lets the queue keep draining toward
    hardware. Reversing someone's halt is an arming action, so it is gated
    twice over locally: ``control_system.writes_enabled`` is re-read fresh, and
    a missing launch token is refused here as well, both before any HTTP call —
    then the bridge checks both again. That local token check is MORE than
    ``queue_start`` does: a tokenless start goes to the bridge and relays the
    bridge's refusal, while a tokenless withdrawal never leaves this process.
    Only withdraw a stop when you know why it was requested.

    Args:
        cancel: False (default) requests the stop. True withdraws a pending
            stop, which is an arming action.

    Returns:
        JSON ``{"stop_pending", "msg"}`` — ``stop_pending`` is true after a
        stop request, false after a withdrawal.

    Refusals:
        - writes_disabled (cancel=True only): writes are off, so a pending stop
          cannot be withdrawn. A plain stop is never refused for this reason.
        - launch_token_required (cancel=True only): no launch token here or at
          the bridge, or the two do not match. This deployment did not grant
          this agent a usable token — ask the operator to withdraw the stop
          from their queue panel instead; never chase the token in config.
        - manager_not_configured / manager_unreachable: the manager could not
          be reached. The queue was NOT stopped — say so plainly; do not report
          an unconfirmed halt as done.
        - queue_request_rejected: the manager refused (e.g. no stop is pending
          to withdraw).
