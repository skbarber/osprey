"""MCP tools: author and validate a session-tier Bluesky plan file.

Both tools are thin HTTP clients of the bridge's authoring routes and reach
NO hardware — ``write_plan`` only writes a file (never imports or
execs it), and ``validate_plan``'s dry run drives mock devices only,
in a subprocess with ``EPICS_CA_*`` neutralized (see
``osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.plan_validation``). Both therefore work
identically whether ``control_system.writes_enabled`` is on or off, and
neither carries the kill-switch (``_WRITES_CHECK``) hook — see the ``bluesky``
``ServerDefinition`` in ``registry/mcp.py``. Both are still approval-gated
(``permissions_ask``) so a human sees every authored/validated plan body.

Same conventions as ``read_tools.py``: ``async def``, JSON string return
(``json.dumps`` / ``make_error``), blocking HTTP dispatched via
``anyio.to_thread.run_sync``, and the shared ``_http_post_json`` /
``bridge_error_message`` helpers from ``bluesky/server_context.py``.

    """Author a session-tier plan file on the bridge. Reaches NO hardware.

    The bridge assembles a `PLAN_METADATA = {...}` block from exactly
    ``name``/``description``/``writes`` and prepends it to ``body`` (your own
    ``PARAMS`` + ``build_plan`` source, per the layered directory catalog's
    file contract), writing the combined text as one file. The bridge NEVER
    imports or execs this file — it is inert until validate_plan passes it
    and, later, a human approves launching it. Re-authoring an existing
    ``name`` overwrites the file and invalidates any prior passing validation
    (its content hash changes).

    Which channels the plan touches is NOT declared here. Declare it in the
    ``body``'s `PARAMS` model with the role-typed field helpers from
    ``osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.plan_fields`` — ``MovableChannels`` /
    ``ReadableChannels`` for a list field, ``MovableChannel`` /
    ``ReadableChannel`` for one channel inside a nested model. Every consumer
    (dry-run mocks, the pre-queue channel check, the devices your
    ``build_plan`` is handed, the default figure) reads those fields, so an
    undeclared channel is simply not available to the plan.

    Args:
        name: Plan name — must be a valid Python identifier; doubles as the
            on-disk file stem and the generated metadata's ``name`` field.
        writes: Whether this plan moves a channel (vs. reading only). Passing
            true obliges the ``body`` to declare at least one movable channel
            field; the load gate quarantines a plan that declares none. It has
            no effect on whether writes actually happen; that is governed
            entirely by ``control_system.writes_enabled``.
        body: Your plan's own source: a `PARAMS` pydantic model (optional)
            and a `build_plan(devices, params)` callable, exactly as a
            directory-layer plan file needs — see the orm exemplar plan for
            the expected shape. A ``writes: true`` plan that opens its own run
            must declare its point count on that run:
            ``md=scan_metadata(movable=..., readable=..., points=...)``
            (also from ``plan_fields``) on the run decorator, so operators can
            watch its progress. A plan delegating to a stock bluesky plan
            inherits that stamp and needs nothing.
        description: Human-readable summary of what the plan does.

    Returns:
        JSON ``{"name", "content_hash"}`` on success — pass ``name`` to
        validate_plan next. On rejection (e.g. an invalid ``name``),
        an error envelope naming what to fix.

    Runs the bridge's three-stage validator (static import/pattern allowlist,
    then a mock-device dry run) against the CURRENT on-disk content of the
    named session plan file — never a body you pass here directly, so the
    validated bytes are always exactly the file's bytes. The dry run drives
    in-process mock devices only, in a subprocess whose ``EPICS_CA_*``
    variables are neutralized; it never reaches a real device regardless of
    ``control_system.writes_enabled``. A passing validation is recorded by
    content hash so the plan becomes loadable and enqueueable;
    editing the file afterward changes its hash and drops the record, so it
    must be re-validated.

    Args:
        name: Session plan name, as passed to write_plan.
        sample_args: Sample `PARAMS` field values used to build the dry run's

        just passed were loaded into the queue worker's namespace — a pass with
        ``uploaded: false`` is still a genuine pass (a deployment with no queue
        server has nowhere to upload to), but the plan is not enqueueable until
        an upload lands, so ``reason``/``detail`` are what to relay if a later
