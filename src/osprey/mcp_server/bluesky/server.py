"""OSPREY Bluesky MCP Server.

FastMCP server exposing Bluesky plan/run control as a thin HTTP client of the
facility-side Bluesky bridge: list plans, check run status, stage a shared
plan draft, queue that draft and start the queue, stop a run, and author
(write_plan) plus validate (validate_plan) a session-tier plan
file. A Bluesky plan is an arbitrary generator (count, mv, scan, grid_scan,
custom acquisition routines) — nothing here is scan-specific. This module and
its tools make no bluesky/ophyd/tiled imports — every operation is an HTTP
request to the bridge (see ``osprey.services.bluesky_bridge``).

Usage:
    python -m osprey.mcp_server.bluesky
