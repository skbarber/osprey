"""Bluesky MCP Server Context — bridge connection resolution and HTTP boundary.

Holds the resolved facility-side Bluesky bridge connection (base URL and launch
token) for the MCP server process and exposes the module-level HTTP primitives
every tool module uses to talk to the bridge. Centralizing the primitives here
means every tool gets identical ``bluesky_bridge_unreachable`` handling without
repeating a try/except around each HTTP call.

The bridge URL / launch token resolution itself and the ``bridge_error_message``
helper live in the shared leaf ``osprey.bluesky_bridge_connection``, imported by
both this MCP server and the bluesky-web sidecar so the two never drift on which
bridge instance or token they use (a safety-relevant bug class). This module
re-exports ``bridge_error_message`` so the tool modules (``read_tools``,
``launch``, ``stop``, ``draft``, ``authoring``) keep importing it from here
alongside the ``UNKNOWN_RUN_HINTS`` helper.

Usage in tools:
    from osprey.mcp_server.bluesky.server_context import _http_get_json, _http_post_json

    status, body = _http_get_json("/runs")
