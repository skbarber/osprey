    """Search the ARIEL logbook using hybrid keyword + semantic ranking.

    Runs both a keyword and a vector query over the mirrored logbook corpus and
    returns one merged ranking. Best when a question mixes specific terms with a
    described situation, or when keyword_search returned too little.

    Filtering here is best-effort, and that matters for how you read a short
    result set. The corpus is ranked first and the date, author and
    source_system filters are applied afterwards to the top of that ranking —
    they are not applied inside the database. A selective filter can therefore
    return fewer than max_results entries even when more matching entries exist
    in the corpus. Read a short result set as "the ranked window ran out", never
    as "no more matching entries exist". When a filter has to be exhaustive —
    every entry by one author, every entry in a date range — use keyword_search
    or sql_query, which filter in the database rather than after ranking.

    Args:
        query: Natural language description or keywords describing what to find.
        max_results: Maximum number of results (1-100, default 10).
        start_date: Filter entries after this ISO-8601 date (e.g. "2024-01-15").
        end_date: Filter entries before this ISO-8601 date.
        author: Filter by author name (partial match).
        source_system: Filter by source system (exact match).
        exclude_entry_ids: Entry IDs to exclude from results (for iterative search).

    Returns:
        JSON with matching entries and relevance scores. Scores order the
        results and are not comparable across queries.
