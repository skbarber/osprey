    The MCP server is an agent-reachable process, so it carries the *panel

    routes — and never the operator secret that authorises a browser session.

    The value is read from ``OSPREY_PANEL_TOKEN`` on every call rather than
    captured at import: the carrier is published into the environment by the
    launching process, which may happen after this module is first imported.

    The last non-blank value seen is also latched, because this process can
    lose the carrier from under itself: saving an artifact auto-launches the
    artifact companion app (``osprey.stores.artifact_store`` ->
    ``ensure_artifact_server``), and when that happens in-process the app's
    construction closes both credential carriers in ``os.environ`` — the
    same scrub every interface app performs so a child it spawns cannot
    inherit them.  Without the latch every panel call after that point would
    go out with no bearer and be refused.  The environment is still consulted
    first, so a value published after import (or rotated) wins over the latch.
    The latch is never fed from the credential holder: in a process that
    never held a carrier, ``get_web_credentials()`` would *mint* a token the
    terminal does not recognise.

    Returns:

    Posts ``{"tool": tool, "target": {"kind": kind, "panel"?: ..., "detail"?: ...}}``
    to ``/api/agent-activity`` so the UI can highlight what the agent is
    touching.  ``panel``/``detail`` are omitted from the body when ``None``.
    Non-fatal if the web terminal is not running (CLI-only mode): all
    exceptions are swallowed and this function never raises.

    .. warning::
        This function performs a **blocking** HTTP call (bounded at 1s).
        Async tools MUST call it via ``await anyio.to_thread.run_sync(...)``
        — never inline in a coroutine.  Calling a sync ``post_json``-style
        helper directly from async code stalls the event loop (a known
        foot-gun with the existing sync-post-in-async pattern; do not copy it).

    Args:
        tool: Name of the tool the agent invoked.
        kind: Activity target kind (validated server-side; unknown kinds 422).
        panel: Optional panel identifier the activity targets.
        detail: Optional free-form detail (e.g. channel name, file path).
            Truncated to the route's 1024-char bound so an unbounded caller
            (e.g. a bulk channel write) cannot turn the emit into a silent 422.

    Control-system activity (``kind`` :data:`CONTROL_ACTIVITY_KIND`) is stamped
    with the session's target here, in the one place every emit site passes
    through, so ``channel_write``, ``execute`` and ``execute_file`` report the
    same machine without each resolving it — three resolutions is how three
    surfaces start disagreeing. The stamp rides in ``detail`` because that is
    the only free field the ``/api/agent-activity`` route carries through to the
    browser: its request model names ``kind``/``panel``/``detail`` and drops
    anything else, so a structured ``target`` key would be silently discarded
    server-side and never reach an operator's screen.
