"""The MCP audit middleware — every ``tools/call`` recorded, writes clamped.

Osprey's write gating used to live entirely in the ``osprey_writes_check.py``
PreToolUse hook, which is a *client-side* layer: Claude Code runs it, it fails
open by design (an uncaught exception exits non-zero and the tool proceeds), and
nothing outside Claude Code consults it at all. This middleware is the
server-side half. It sits on every framework MCP server a deployment launches,
so the sandbox posture is enforced where the tool actually executes and every
call — refused or not — leaves a record.

**What it decides.** Under the sandbox posture
(``OSPREY_EXECUTION_MODE=readonly``, matched by *value*, never by presence) a
call whose fully-qualified name is in the clamp set is refused before the tool
runs. The clamp set is the rendered ``hook_config.json``'s ``write_tools``
*minus* its ``mixed_read_write_tools`` — the read/write tools, of which
``mcp__python__execute`` is the framework's one, keep their own in-tool clamp
because a *readonly* execution is exactly what a sandboxed session is for.
Refusing them here would take the reads with the writes.

**Where it reads that from.** Exclusively from ``OSPREY_CONFIG``, which
``registry/mcp.py`` sets to ``<root>/build/config.yml`` for every framework
server it launches: the hook config is its sibling at
:data:`HOOK_CONFIG_RELPATH`. Never a project-root resolver (that answers the
repo root, one level up from the render zone) and never a cwd guess — a server
started with no ``OSPREY_CONFIG`` gets the degraded floor and one loud warning
rather than a plausible-looking file from somewhere else.

**Both lists fall together.** A hook config that is missing, unreadable,
malformed, or that parses without either list yields :data:`_FALLBACK_WRITE_TOOLS`
minus :data:`_FALLBACK_MIXED_TOOLS` — never a loaded write list against a floor
exclusion, which would clamp ``execute`` as a pure write tool and break readonly
executions. The stated consequence: on a pre-feature render, which parses
without the mixed key, the clamp is the floor only and a facility's other write
tools stay hook-covered until the operator re-renders. Containers self-heal via
the entrypoint's drift check; bare hosts get the warning naming ``osprey build``.

**Fresh without a restart.** The file is stat'ed once per call and re-parsed
only when :data:`_STAT_FIELDS` moved, so a re-render lands on an open session
instead of waiting for a server restart. A re-parse that *fails* keeps the last
good clamp set **plus** the floor: the previous answer is still the best
evidence available, and adding the floor to it can only narrow.

**Fails closed on an unrecognised prefix.** The subject a record names is
``mcp__<prefix>__<tool>``, where the prefix comes from
:data:`TOOL_PREFIX_ENV` — assigned post-merge by the registry on every launch
path so a server spec cannot pin it. If that prefix is not among the rendered
``server_prefixes`` (which lists every enabled server), this process is a stale
clone, a mis-prefixed one, or a server the render has never heard of; the
rendered write set **plus** the floor is clamped, with one warning. A server
that is *known* but contributes no write tools is not a mismatch: it runs, and
it says nothing.

**A clamp is matched fully-qualified only when the prefix was verified.** The
one branch that proves this process is the server the render is talking about
is "the prefix env is set *and* ``mcp__<prefix>__`` is among the rendered
``server_prefixes``". Only there is membership an exact match on the
fully-qualified name, so two servers cannot collide on a shared tool name.
Everywhere else — a degraded parse, a prefix the render does not list, no
prefix at all — the qualification is exactly what is untrustworthy, so the
*bare* tool name is matched against each clamp entry's own bare half.
Without that, every fail-closed branch is a no-op for any server whose rendered
name is not one the clamp entries happen to spell: an ``extends`` clone is
launched with its own name as the prefix, so ``mcp__controls_ring__`` qualifies
nothing the floor names. The cost is bounded over-refusal — a read tool sharing
a bare name with some write tool — under the sandbox posture, in a state this
module already calls a framework bug.

**The innermost recorder owns the decision.** A tool's own gates run inside
this layer, and one of them — the executor's session-posture clamp — files its
own record on the ``executor`` surface. When it does, it leaves a marker
(:mod:`osprey.audit.dedup`) and this layer defers: no second record, and in
particular no ``allowed`` stamped on a call an inner guard refused while still
returning a successful result. Same process, same call, cleared on the way in
and out; a marker inherited across a ``fork`` is not believed. The deferral is
transitive — the marker is re-asserted once the scope closes — so a layer
stacked outside this one defers to the same answer.

**Nothing here may cost the call it records.** Records go through
:func:`~osprey.audit.writer.record`, which builds the envelope and appends it
inside its own never-raises boundary; the one place this module could still
raise on its own (reading the config) is wrapped. The clamp *decision* is
deliberately not: an internal error there costs the call rather than becoming
an allowed write. A refusal that could not be audited is still a refusal.

    Three cells, because :func:`osprey.audit.posture.posture` says ``sandbox``
    for reasons an operator acts on differently:

    * the **deployment** is running in readonly execution mode. ``posture()``
      short-circuits to that ENVIRONMENT answer before the store is read, so
      this is the deployment's own switch, not this session's — and the
      control-target chip cannot lift it. Named all the same, because it is the
      first place an operator looks.
    * this **session's posture for ONE control target** is read-only. The
      operator's own narrowing, made from the chip, so the chip is where it
      lifts — and the target is named, because narrowing one machine leaves the
      session working normally on every other one.
    * the same, but the **target cannot be named**. The store's rule with no
      resolvable target is that the most restrictive entry decides, and which
      one that was is not knowable here, so nothing is invented.

    The wordings are the executor clamp's, deliberately: an operator who meets
    both gates in one session should not have to work out that they are the
    same refusal.
