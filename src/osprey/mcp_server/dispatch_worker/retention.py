"""Opt-in retention sweep for dispatch run records and artifacts.

Disabled by default. Set the ``RETENTION_DAYS`` env var to a positive integer to
enable it; unset, empty, ``0``, or a non-integer all mean *disabled* (nothing is
ever deleted). When enabled, a periodic background task deletes:

  * persisted dispatch run records (``<agent-data root>/dispatch/{run_id}.json``), and
  * ``ArtifactStore`` entries (index row + on-disk file),

whose age exceeds the threshold. Age is measured from a record's completion (a
run record's ``completed_at``, falling back to ``created_at``; an artifact's
``timestamp``). A record is deleted only when it is strictly older than
``RETENTION_DAYS`` days — a record aged exactly ``N-1`` days survives, one aged
``N+1`` days is deleted.

In-flight runs are never swept regardless of age: a run record whose status is
not terminal is skipped, and any run id currently pending in the worker (passed
in as ``in_flight_run_ids``) is skipped along with the artifacts it produced.

This is a generic OSPREY-core capability with no channel awareness. The sweep
functions are pure (they take the log dir, an ``ArtifactStore``, and an injected
``now``) so they can be driven directly in tests without a clock or sleeps.
