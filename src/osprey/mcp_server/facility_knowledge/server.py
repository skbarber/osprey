"""OSPREY Facility Knowledge MCP Server.

FastMCP server exposing OKF bundle read tools: list_concepts, read_concept,
and search.  The bundle root is resolved from the ``facility_knowledge.bundle_path``
key in config.yml (via ``OSPREY_CONFIG``), relative to the config file's parent
directory when the value is not absolute.

    Creates or replaces the ``.md`` file for *concept_id* in the bundle.
    The document is validated at the ``"authoring"`` level (OKF §9) before

    The file is written atomically (temp file plus rename), and the bundle's
    ``.qmd-touch`` freshness marker is then rewritten — also atomically — so a
    search sidecar re-indexes the new document promptly rather than waiting for
    its next interval sweep.

    **Human approval required** — this tool is listed in the ``approval``
    config under ``draft_concept: always``.  The OSPREY ``PreToolUse`` hook
    intercepts the call and prompts for operator confirmation before the

    call and this function is never invoked.

    **Collision policy** — the effective policy is last-write-wins.  Because
    this function contains no ``await`` points — the document write and the
    marker rewrite are both synchronous — the asyncio event loop never yields
    mid-call; approval-gated calls are therefore serialised in practice and each
    overwrites the previous file.  ``_drafts_in_flight`` is kept as a latent
    defense-in-depth guard in case the write path ever acquires an ``await``;
    it does not fire under the current execution model.

    Last-write-wins spans **users**, not just calls: several operators may run
    their own agent against one shared bundle, and that set is only serialised
    within a single server process.  Two users drafting the same concept ID
    still each write a whole, valid document — the atomic rename rules out a
    torn file — but the later write silently supersedes the earlier one, and
    ``_drafts_in_flight`` cannot detect the cross-process case.  Concurrent
    edits to one concept must be coordinated outside this tool.

    Args:
        concept_id: OKF §2 path-minus-extension identifier for the concept to
            write, e.g. ``accelerator_overview`` or ``tables/beam_params``.
            Must not escape the bundle root (path traversal is rejected).
        doc_type: Value for the ``type`` frontmatter field (e.g.
            ``facility_overview``, ``data_table``, ``reference``).
        title: Human-readable display name for the concept.
        description: One-sentence summary used in index listings and search
            snippets.
        body: Markdown body text that follows the frontmatter block.
        extra_frontmatter: JSON object of additional frontmatter key/value
            pairs to merge alongside ``type``, ``title``, and ``description``.
            Defaults to ``{}``.
