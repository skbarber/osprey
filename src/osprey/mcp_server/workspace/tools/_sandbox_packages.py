"""Live package inventory for the visualization tool descriptions.

A visualization tool description must never name a fixed package set: the agent
would plan imports against a set the deployment need not have installed.

This module renders that line from the environment the *visualization sandbox*
actually uses, which is deliberately not the one
:mod:`osprey.mcp_server.python_executor.tools._package_inventory` describes:

* the Python executor runs agent code under
  :func:`~osprey.mcp_server.python_executor.executor.resolve_agent_interpreter`
  — the project's own venv whenever the project ships one;
* :func:`~osprey.mcp_server.workspace.execution.sandbox_executor.execute_sandbox_code`
  runs it under ``sys.executable`` — the MCP server's own interpreter.

A viz-tool description must therefore describe ``sys.executable``, and it must
also respect the sandbox's import allowlist: a package can be installed and
still be unimportable here, because
:func:`~osprey.mcp_server.workspace.execution.sandbox_executor.validate_sandbox_code`
rejects imports outside the allowlist before the code ever runs. The honest
inventory is the intersection of the two gates.

Rendering, the placeholder token, the names-nothing fallback, and the docstring
substitution itself are reused from the Python-executor inventory so both tool
surfaces speak one vocabulary; only the environment being enumerated differs.
