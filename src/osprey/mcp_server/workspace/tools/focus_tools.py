"""MCP tools: artifact_focus, artifact_pin.

artifact_focus selects a specific artifact in the gallery so the user sees it.
artifact_pin toggles the pinned flag for quick access filtering.

Both tools report gallery outcomes honestly instead of fire-and-forget:

* ``artifact_focus``: the entire effect is gallery-side, so a failed or
  rejected POST is a tool error (``gallery_unreachable`` / ``gallery_error``
  — ``make_error`` raises a fastmcp ``ToolError``).
* ``artifact_pin``: the durable pin lands in the shared index first
  (``set_pinned``), so the response stays ``success`` but reports whether the
  gallery was actually notified via ``gallery_notified``.
