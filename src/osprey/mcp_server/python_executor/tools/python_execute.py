    """Execute Python code with process isolation, limits enforcement, and timeout.

    Code runs in a subprocess, in the project's own Python environment when the
    project has one (otherwise OSPREY's own interpreter).
    <<AVAILABLE_PACKAGES>>

    Safety layers applied before execution:
      1. ``quick_safety_check()`` — blocks exec/eval/__import__/subprocess
      2. ``path_policy_issues()`` — in *every* mode, blocks literal writes into
         the render zone, the profile sources and the audit ledger, and code
         that names the sandbox guard's own internals
      3. ``check_readonly_imports()`` — readonly runs may not import
         control-system client libraries (epics, p4p, ...) at all
      4. ``detect_control_system_operations()`` — blocks detected write
         spellings in readonly mode
    Safety layers applied during execution:
      5. Readonly guard — in readonly runs every control-system write entry
         point refuses, as do the routes that reach one without a client
         import (starting a process, ``ctypes``); the connectors refuse
         ``write_channel``, and the EPICS connector stays on the read_only
         gateway (``OSPREY_EXECUTION_MODE``)
      6. ``ExecutionWrapper`` monkeypatch — validates epics.caput() against limits DB
      7. Process isolation — code runs outside the MCP server process
      8. Execution timeout — kills execution after configured timeout

    A refused write is reported to the operator and recorded in the
    deployment's audit log, at whichever layer catches it. A readonly script
    therefore cannot shell out or load a shared library at all, even for
    unrelated work — resubmit as readwrite, which requires human approval.

    A ``save_artifact(obj, title, description)`` helper is available in the
    subprocess for saving objects to the artifact gallery.

    Args:
        code: Python source code to execute.
        description: Human-readable description of what the code does.
        execution_mode: "readonly" (default) blocks detected write patterns;
                        "readwrite" allows them. Any other value is rejected.
        save_output: If True, save the code and output to a workspace data file.

    Returns:
        JSON with a compact summary (truncated stdout/stderr) and a data file path.
