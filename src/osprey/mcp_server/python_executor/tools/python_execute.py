    """Execute Python code with process isolation, limits enforcement, and timeout.

    Code runs in a container or local subprocess (configured via config.yml).
    <<AVAILABLE_PACKAGES>>

    Safety layers applied before execution:
      1. ``quick_safety_check()`` — blocks exec/eval/__import__/subprocess
      2. ``detect_control_system_operations()`` — blocks writes in readonly mode
    Safety layers applied during execution:
      3. ``ExecutionWrapper`` monkeypatch — validates epics.caput() against limits DB
      4. Process isolation — code runs outside the MCP server process
      5. Execution timeout — kills execution after configured timeout

    A ``save_artifact(obj, title, description)`` helper is available in the
    subprocess for saving objects to the artifact gallery.

    Args:
        code: Python source code to execute.
        description: Human-readable description of what the code does.
        execution_mode: "readonly" (default) blocks detected write patterns;
                        "readwrite" allows them. Any other value is rejected.
        save_output: If True, save the code and output to a workspace data file.

    Returns:
        JSON with a compact summary (truncated stdout/stderr) and a data file path.
