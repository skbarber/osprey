"""Shared execution-mode gates for the ``execute`` and ``execute_file`` tools.

Both tools take an ``execution_mode`` string and guard control-system writes
with two independent checks: a per-call readonly gate (pattern detection) and a
deployment-level kill switch (``control_system.writes_enabled`` in the project
config). Each gate only recognises one canonical spelling, so any *other*
string falls through both — not "readonly", so write patterns are not blocked;
not "readwrite", so the kill switch never fires. Rejecting unknown modes here
closes that hole for every caller at once, and gives the kill switch a single
implementation instead of one copy per tool.
