"""Cache + single-flight refresh context backing the stdio health MCP server.

The stdio health server answers an agent's ``poll`` tool by serving a cached
health report and, only when that cache is invalid, running exactly one poll
suite behind a single-flight lock. Unlike the web engine
(:class:`osprey.interfaces.health.engine.HealthCheckEngine`), which is
loop-affine and refresh-*ahead* (a browser poll never blocks on a suite run),
this context is refresh-*inline*: the tool caller awaits the refresh. Concurrent
callers coalesce onto the one in-flight run and then serve its fresh snapshot,
so two poll suites never run at once.

Composition (mirrors the web engine's building blocks):

* One :class:`~osprey.health.loader.HealthConfigLoader` owns the
  synchronous config-load phase (config-path resolution, ``.env``/``config.yml``
  mtime gating, merged-record assembly, and the degrade-to-default-settings
  contract). It is driven off the event loop through
  :func:`osprey.health.offload.run_sync` so a wedged plugin import cannot block
  process exit.
* One :class:`~osprey.health.lifecycle.HealthRuntimeLifecycle` owns
  the single connector runtime: :meth:`~HealthRuntimeLifecycle.reconcile` is
  called each refresh (re-snapshotting the runtime before first connect, and
  surfacing a restart-notice row after) and :meth:`~HealthRuntimeLifecycle.shutdown`
  performs the bounded connector teardown.
* One :func:`osprey.health.refresh.run_poll_refresh` per refresh — the poll
  cycle shared with the web engine (reconcile → ``full=False`` /
  ``categories=None`` suite → append plugin/notice rows). The cache always holds
  the full poll suite so any caller's category selection can be satisfied
  downstream by filtering the returned report; category selection never re-runs
  the suite.

Validity, wedge breaker, and single-flight are the three invariants:

1. **Validity.** A snapshot is valid iff its age (``clock() - cached_at``) does
   not exceed ``interval_s`` *and* the disk signature (``config.yml`` + ``.env``
   ``(mtime_ns, size)``) is unchanged since the snapshot was taken. A changed
   signature forces a refresh regardless of age.
2. **Wedge breaker.** While an abandoned worker thread is still alive
   (:func:`osprey.health.offload.abandoned_alive_count` ``> 0``) and the disk
   signature has not changed since suppression began, refreshes are suppressed:
   an existing snapshot is served flagged ``refresh_suppressed=True``; a cold
   context (no snapshot) raises :class:`HealthRefreshSuppressedError` for the
   tool layer to convert. A signature change permits exactly one refresh attempt
   while wedged (the disk-change escape), after which — if still wedged — the new
   signature is re-anchored and suppression resumes.
3. **Single-flight.** All refreshing happens under one :class:`asyncio.Lock`.
   Validity is re-checked after the lock is acquired, so a caller that queued
   behind an in-flight refresh serves that refresh's fresh snapshot instead of
   running a redundant second suite.
