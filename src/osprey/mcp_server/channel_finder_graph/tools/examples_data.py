"""Curated Cypher examples for the graph channel-finder paradigm.

Pure data: no imports beyond the standard library and the
:class:`~osprey.mcp_server.graph.tools.examples_data.ExampleQuery` dataclass the
main-agent graph server already defines, so this module can be read by the
``example_queries`` tool, by tests and by documentation without touching the
driver or the store.

This catalogue is **not** the main-agent graph server's catalogue. That one
teaches an operator the shape of the store — how many devices there are, what
the ontology looks like, whether the import was complete. This one does the
channel finder's job and only that job: **a phrase an operator said turns into
the addresses a connector can talk to**. Every query is therefore about
``fullPv`` — reaching it, or starting from it.

Two ways in
-----------
The queries fall into two halves, and the split is the point:

* *Search by meaning* — the operator says "vacuum gauge" or "bending magnet"
  and the graph matches that against the prose the corpus carries: a per-address
  description, the meaning of the address' field and subfield, what the device
  family does, which system it belongs to.
* *Search by structure* — the operator already knows a word, a place, a device
  or an address, and the graph walks the machine: a class and everything under
  it, a whole section, one device's addresses split into reads and writes, one
  address back to the device that owns it.

Query shape
-----------
Every query is written against the shape neosemantics produces from a
NARAD-convention Turtle corpus with ``applyNeo4jNaming`` on, which is what
``osprey knowledge seed-graph`` loads:

* node labels are the RDF class local names — ``:Resource`` on every node, plus
  ``:ChannelBinding``, ``:Class``, and one device-class label per device. There
  is **no ``:Device`` label**: a device is reached as ``:Resource`` plus the
  properties only a device carries, or through its ``narad_sem`` class;
* relationship types are UPPERCASED — ``:HASBINDING``, ``:READSSIGNAL``,
  ``:WRITESSIGNAL``, ``:SUBCLASSOF``, ``:TYPE``;
* property names keep their ``narad_p:`` local spelling — ``.fullPv``,
  ``.sourceName``, ``.sectionCode``, ``.description``, ``.system``;
* ``skos:altLabel`` arrives as a **list**, because the store is configured with
  ``handleMultival: ARRAY`` for that predicate. Synonym matching therefore uses
  list semantics (``ANY(l IN cls.altLabel WHERE ...)``); a scalar ``CONTAINS``
  against ``altLabel`` would be a bug, not a shortcut.

Corpora
-------
The Cypher is corpus-agnostic — nothing about a particular facility is baked
into a query, only into its parameter values. Each example carries one
parameter set whose values exist in the shipped demo machine. No parameter set
is ever empty — every example takes at least one parameter, and the set
supplies exactly the parameters its query references.

The first four examples search prose the generator writes onto the corpus —
the description predicates and the ``system`` token — which the demo corpus
carries because its source channel database does. A corpus imported straight
from a facility export may carry none of it; on such a corpus those examples
return no rows while the structural ones still answer.

Every query is bounded: it ends in a ``LIMIT``, and that ``LIMIT`` is at most
``services.graphdb.query_max_rows``' default of 200. Both halves matter. Ending
in a bound is what keeps an example from being the reason a result comes back
truncated; keeping the bound under the row cap is what makes the number in the
query the number a caller actually receives. An example limited to 500 does not
return 500 rows — it returns the cap's 200 and a truncation flag, which reads to
the caller as an answer that was cut short rather than as the whole answer the
query asked for.
