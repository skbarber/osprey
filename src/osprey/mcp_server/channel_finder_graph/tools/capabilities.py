"""MCP tool: capabilities — what the graph paradigm expects of the channel finder.

PROMPT-PROVIDER: this tool's response is a static manifest read by the agent
before it plans a query. It deliberately does not dial the store, so a
successful response says nothing about whether the graph is reachable or seeded.

The main-agent graph server has a manifest of its own, and this is not a copy of
it. That one describes a general-purpose Cypher surface; this one describes a
*job*: an operator said a phrase, and the answer is the addresses a connector
can talk to. So it carries the four things an agent cannot guess and would
otherwise have to discover by running failing queries — how an address is
spelled and where it comes from, which prose exists to match a phrase against
and on which node, that synonyms are a list rather than a string, and how many
rows a query may return before it is cut off.

Everything here is a fact about the *corpus convention*, never about the data:
which corpus a deployment seeded is a store fact, so the manifest names the
property that carries it rather than answering it. The one live read is the row
cap and the query deadline, taken from the server context so a deployment that
raised either is not told the default. That read touches settings resolved at
startup, not the driver, which is what keeps this tool answerable when the graph
is unconfigured or down — the moment an agent most needs to be told what the
paradigm is.
