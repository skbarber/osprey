"""Shared scaffolding for the channel-finder MCP server variants.

The three channel-finder pipelines
(``channel_finder_hierarchical``, ``channel_finder_middle_layer``,
``channel_finder_in_context``) each ship an identical server bootstrap: an
entry point, a ``create_server()`` startup sequence, and per-context config
loading and path resolution. Only the FastMCP instance, the pipeline-specific
server context, and the tool modules differ between variants — those stay in
each package. This module holds the common bootstrap so the variants become
thin parameterizations of it.
