    """Return curated, runnable Cypher examples for the common graph questions.

    Read this before writing Cypher against the facility knowledge graph. The
    examples are written against the real shape of the corpus — node labels,
    relationship types and property spellings that actually exist — so adapting
    one is reliable where inventing a query from scratch is guesswork. Together
    they cover:

    * device rollups by class, both concrete and aggregated up the ontology;
    * walking one section of the machine in beamline order;
    * every PV bound to a named device, split by read/write direction;
    * the class hierarchy, as single edges and as whole inheritance chains;
    * a read/write summary across all channel bindings;
    * which devices share a given PV.

    Start from the closest example and change it — swap a parameter value, add a
    WHERE clause, widen or narrow the LIMIT — rather than composing a new query
    shape. Each example's ``description`` says what its parameters mean and how
    to vary them; ``get_schema`` lists the labels and relationship types if you
    need to go further than the examples reach.

    Does NOT require graph connectivity, so this is *not* a health check: a
    successful response says nothing about whether the store is reachable or
    seeded.

    Returns:
        JSON object with ``count``, ``examples`` (each ``{key, title,
        description, cypher, parameters}``, where ``parameters`` maps the
        query's placeholders to values that exist in the shipped demo machine)
        and ``notes`` (list of strings on how to run them).
