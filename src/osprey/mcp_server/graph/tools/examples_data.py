"""Curated Cypher examples for the graph MCP server.

Pure data: no imports beyond the standard library, so this module can be read by
the ``example_queries`` tool, by tests and by documentation without touching the
driver or the store.

Every query is written against the shape neosemantics produces from a
NARAD-convention Turtle corpus with ``applyNeo4jNaming`` on, which is what
``osprey knowledge seed-graph`` loads:

* node labels are the RDF class local names — ``:Resource`` on every node,
  plus ``:ChannelBinding``, ``:Class``, and one device-class label per device;
* relationship types are UPPERCASED — ``:HASBINDING``, ``:READSSIGNAL``,
  ``:WRITESSIGNAL``, ``:SUBCLASSOF``, ``:TYPE``;
* property names keep their ``narad_p:`` local spelling — ``.uri``, ``.fullPv``,
  ``.sourceName``, ``.sectionCode``, ``.sPositionM``, ``.ordinalInSection``,
  ``.confidence``.

Those uppercase relationship names belong to the *graph projection* only. The
Turtle corpus itself spells them ``narad_p:hasBinding`` and friends.

The queries are corpus-agnostic: nothing about a particular facility is baked
into the Cypher, only into the parameter values. Each example carries one
parameter set whose values exist in the shipped demo machine, so every example
runs as-is against a deployment that seeded it; on any other corpus the values
are read off the rows the structural queries return.

Every query is bounded: it ends in a ``LIMIT`` even where an aggregate already
guarantees a handful of rows, so no example can be the reason a result comes
back truncated.
