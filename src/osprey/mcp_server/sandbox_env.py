"""Sensitive-environment scrub shared by every agent-code execution sandbox.

Both ``python_executor.executor`` (the general-purpose Python execution
sandbox) and ``workspace.execution.sandbox_executor`` (the lighter
visualization-only sandbox) spawn a local subprocess to run agent-generated
Python code. Both must exclude write-arming secrets from that subprocess's
environment: agent-run code must never be able to read a token that gates a
write-capable action from outside the sandbox (e.g. the Bluesky bridge's
``/queue/start`` endpoint, event-dispatch webhooks) and call the gated
endpoint directly. The in-tool ``writes_enabled`` re-check inside the queue's
arming tools is the actual write-safety authority — not possession of a
token — so this scrub closes the read side of that attack surface.

Centralized here (rather than duplicated per sandbox) so the two deny-lists
cannot drift.
