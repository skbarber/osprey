"""Declarative facility specification — the single source of truth for the
simulated facility's device families, counts, naming scheme, and machine
constants.

Stdlib-only (``dataclasses`` + ``typing``), zero third-party dependencies,
following the import discipline of
:mod:`osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.devices.specs` (plain frozen dataclasses,
no control-system imports) and the catalog-lookup shape of
:mod:`osprey.services.build_artifacts.catalog`.

The spec is the authority on families / counts / names, and the hand-ported
ring (:func:`osprey.simulation.lattice.ring.build_ring`) is its *first
consumer*. A drift-guard test binds the ring's actual per-family element counts
and assigned naming to this declaration
(``tests/simulation/test_facility_spec.py``).

# synthetic steerers the source omits (one of each co-located per BPM). See
# PROPOSAL.md FR3/FR4.
# Naming contract (consumed by ring.py and the tier-DB generator): rendered
# names match ``^(HCM|VCM|QF|QD|QFA|DIPOLE|SF|SD|SHF|SHD|BPM)\d{2,}$``; ids are
# zero-padded to >=2 digits and family-scoped, assigned by ascending
# s-position within each family (ring.py owns the s-ordering — this spec only
# declares the rendering template).
