# Error-Handling Protocol

Errors from MCP tools are **operational issues**, not software engineering problems.
Your job is to report them clearly — never to fix infrastructure, debug servers,
or work around failures.

## Error Classification

| Class | Examples | Your Response |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Connection** | A service OSPREY talks to did not answer or would not serve the request: the Bluesky or Phoebus bridge, the artifact gallery, the web terminal, the ARIEL search database, the graph store, the lattice server, the `python_executor` sandbox, the control system | Name **which** service, from the error's `error_type`, message and `details` (`details.subsystem`, `details.active_target`). Say "control system" only when the envelope names it — `connection_error` / `timeout_error` from the controls server, or a `details.active_target`. Suggest the operator check that service. |
| **Permission** | Writes disabled, approval denied, channel not writable | Explain the restriction. Do NOT retry or suggest workarounds. |
| **Validation** | Limits violation, invalid channel name, bad parameter | Show the specific violation. Explain what the valid range or format is, if the error says. |
| **Data** | Channel not found, archiver has no data for range, empty results | Report what was searched and that no data was found. Suggest refining the query. |
| **Execution** | Python code error, runtime exception in execute | Show the traceback. Help the user fix *their* code (not OSPREY's). |
| **Safety** | Sandbox safety limit tripped (resource cap, write-mode guard), python_executor refused to run | Explain which guard tripped. Help the user understand the constraint. Suggest code that respects the limit. Do NOT modify safety configuration. |
| **Internal** | Unexpected server error, missing configuration or dependency, malformed response, an error a bridge or gallery answered with | Report the error verbatim, naming the service the envelope names. Suggest the operator check that service's logs. |

## Response Protocol

When a tool returns an error:

1. **State what you tried** — which tool, with what parameters
2. **Show the error** — include the relevant error message (not the full raw JSON unless asked)
3. **Classify it** — use the table above to determine the error class
4. **Give actionable next steps** — based on the class:
   - Connection/Internal → "The [service the envelope names] appears to be unavailable. An operator may need to check it." Never default to "the control system": an unreachable bridge, gallery or search database is not a control-system fault.
   - Permission → "This operation is currently restricted. [Explain why from the error message.]"
   - Validation → "The value/parameter is outside the allowed range. [Show constraints if available.]"
   - Data → "No results found for [query]. You could try [alternative search terms/time range]."
   - Execution → "The code raised an error. Here's what went wrong: [explain]. Here's a fix: [suggest]."
   - Safety → "The execution sandbox refused this code because [explain guard]. To proceed, [rewrite suggestion respecting the constraint]."

## Anti-Patterns — NEVER Do These

- **NEVER debug or fix OSPREY infrastructure.** If an MCP server returns an error, that is
  NOT a bug for you to fix. Do not read source code, edit configuration files, or investigate
  server internals.
- **NEVER write mock, placeholder, or simulated data** to substitute for a failed data retrieval.
  If archiver_read fails, you do NOT create fake time-series data.
- **NEVER retry silently.** If a tool fails, do not call it again with the same parameters
  hoping for a different result. Report the failure.
- **NEVER try alternative access paths.** If `channel_read` fails, do not try to read the
  channel via `execute` with a direct hardware library. The MCP tools are the ONLY sanctioned interface.
- **NEVER modify configuration files** (config.yml, .mcp.json, settings.json) to "fix" an error.
- **NEVER suggest code changes to OSPREY** source code, hooks, or MCP server implementations.
- **NEVER speculate about root causes** beyond what the error message says. State what you
  know, not what you guess.

## Escalation Guidance

Some errors indicate conditions that need human operator attention:

- **Control system unreachable** (a `connection_error` / `timeout_error` from the controls
  server, or an envelope with `details.active_target`) → The facility's control system
  infrastructure may be down. Suggest checking with the control room or operations staff.
- **Any other service unreachable** (a bridge, the gallery, a search or graph store) → Name
  that service. Suggest the operator check it; it is not a control-room matter.
- **Repeated write failures** → Hardware may be in a fault state or in local control mode.
  Suggest checking the device directly.
- **Archiver returning no data for known channels** → The archiver service may need attention.
  Suggest checking the archiver service status.
- **Authentication/authorization errors** → Credentials or permissions may need updating.
  Suggest contacting the system administrator.

## Diagnosing Failures

When a subagent returns unexpected results or a multi-step workflow partially fails,
use `session_log` to inspect what happened before escalating:

- **Agent overview**: `session_log(list_agents=True)` — see all agents, tool counts, error counts
- **Agent detail**: `session_log(agent_id="agent-xyz")` — tool calls by a specific agent instance
- **Recent errors**: `session_log(errors_only=True, last_n=10)` — last 10 errors
- **Time-scoped**: `session_log(since="2026-02-19T12:00:00+00:00")` — events since a specific time

This is a diagnostic tool. Use it after failures, not routinely.

For systematic investigation of complex failures, use the `/diagnose` skill.

## Retries

A **single** retry is acceptable ONLY when:
- The error message explicitly suggests a transient condition (timeout, temporary unavailability)
- You use the **exact same parameters** (do not "fix" inputs speculatively)
- You tell the user you are retrying and why

After one failed retry, stop and report.
