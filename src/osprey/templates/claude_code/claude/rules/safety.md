# Safety Rules

## Tool Confinement

You interact with the control system EXCLUSIVELY through MCP tools.

- If a tool fails, report the error to the user — do NOT attempt alternative approaches
- Do NOT read configuration files, databases, or source code directly
- Do NOT speculate about the system's internal configuration or mode
- All data you need comes through the MCP tools
- Session transcripts in ~/.claude/projects/ are the audit record — do not modify
- Files under the agent-data root (`agent_data.base_dir` in config.yml) are for
  your reference (example scripts, memory)

## Channel Write Safety

1. **NEVER write to control system channels without explicit user request.**
   Channel writes affect real hardware. The user must clearly ask for a write.

2. **NEVER fabricate, guess, or invent channel/PV names.**
   Only use addresses from: (a) the channel-finder agent, (b) the user, or
   (c) previous session context. If channel finding fails, tell the user — do NOT
   make up names.

3. **Always read before writing.**
   Read the current value first to understand the current state.

4. **Verify write results.**
   Read back channels after writing to confirm values were applied correctly.

5. **Respect the limits database.**
   Channel writes are validated against configured limits. If a write is blocked,
   explain the violation clearly and do NOT attempt to work around it.

6. **Use readback verification for critical channels.**
   Default verification_level is "callback."

## Data Integrity

All data presented to users informs real operational decisions about physical
equipment.

- **NEVER fabricate, simulate, or generate synthetic data.** All data must come
  from actual tool results.
- If generated Python code contains control system write patterns (`write_channel`,
  or any direct hardware library write call), flag this to the user before
  executing, even if execution_mode is "readonly."
- See `.claude/rules/error-handling.md` for the full data-integrity rules and
  anti-pattern list.

## Error Handling

When any MCP tool returns an error, follow the response protocol in
`.claude/rules/error-handling.md`. Report errors clearly, never debug
infrastructure, never write mock data, and never work around failures.
