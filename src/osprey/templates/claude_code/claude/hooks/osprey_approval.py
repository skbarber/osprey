## Details

Per-tool policies from `approval.tools` in config.yml:
- **skip**: tool allowed without prompt
- **always**: every call requires approval
- **selective**: content-aware (execute checks write patterns + exec mode)
- **enabled: false**: global toggle disables all approval
- **default_policy**: fail-closed default for unmapped tools

Creates a pre-execution notebook artifact for code review whenever
`execute` requires approval (write mode, write patterns, or always policy).

    This is the fact the tool call itself cannot show. Adding to an idle queue
    stages work for a later, separately-approved start; adding to a draining
    one hands the item to the RunEngine with no further human action, and the
    approval prompt is the only place a human can tell those apart.

    Three tiers, most specific first. The two precise headlines are classified
    from what was OBSERVED — a running item, or autostart reported on. The
    third is a single-token NEGATIVE test, ``manager_state != "idle"``, which
    catches every other way the queue can be under way (``starting_queue`` most
    importantly: a start is already in flight but no item is running yet, so
    the observed tests alone would have shown the calm headline on the one line
    whose whole job is telling a human that an enqueue is really an execution).

    Testing for the ONE idle token rather than replicating the manager's set of
    six active states is the difference between failing closed and failing
    open: if the manager ever renames or adds an active state, an unknown token
    is simply "not idle" and still warns, whereas a stale copy of the active
    list would silently classify it as safe. This hook runs standalone, in a
    different process/venv, and cannot import OSPREY, so that direction matters.
    A missing ``manager_state`` counts as not-idle for the same reason — the
    calm sentence must never render around an unknown state.

    The raw ``manager_state`` is printed in every tier so the approver sees the
    manager's own word for it either way.
