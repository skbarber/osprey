## Details

Per-tool policies from `approval.tools` in config.yml:
- **skip**: tool allowed without prompt
- **always**: every call requires approval
- **selective**: content-aware (execute checks write patterns + exec mode)
- **enabled: false**: global toggle disables all approval
- **default_policy**: fail-closed default for unmapped tools

Creates a pre-execution notebook artifact for code review whenever
`execute` requires approval (write mode, write patterns, or always policy).

## Write posture

Ahead of all of that, a write tool whose target this deployment has not armed
exits with NO decision at all, so that the layer which refuses it — the
`osprey_writes_check` deny, or `queue_start`'s own lane gate — is not reopened
by an approval prompt. Posture is per target, so the same tool on the same
deployment can defer on one target and prompt on the other; the operator's own
per-(session, target) narrowing in the posture store counts the same way as a
config disarm, because `osprey_writes_check` reads the same store. A config
that states no posture anywhere prompts exactly as it always has.

## Write-approval stamps

A `channel_write` ask also leaves a *stamp* beside the target state: the target
and generation this prompt was rendered against, written before the dialog is
shown. The controls server reads it back when the tool finally runs and refuses
the write if the session has moved since — see `_stamp_write_approval` for the
correlation key and the multi-session rule. The stamp is an enrichment, never a
gate: a render that cannot write one simply produces a prompt the server cannot
cross-check, exactly as every older render already does.

## Bluesky plan lanes

A deployment that renders two plan lanes — one Bluesky stack per control-system
target — turns "queue this" and "start the queue" into questions about WHICH
machine. The queue describers therefore name the lane an operation binds to,
fetch their detail from that lane's own bridge, and say out loud when a start
names a lane the session has switched away from (which the deployment refuses).
The lane map is render-time truth read from the config's ``services.<lane>``
blocks; the session's target still comes only from the state file. A single-lane
deployment has nothing to address and renders exactly what it always did.

    approval prompt is the only place a human can tell those apart.

# Plan lanes: WHICH Bluesky stack a queue operation would act on
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A plan lane is a whole Bluesky stack — bridge, queue manager, worker — wired
# at RENDER time to one control-system target. Nearly every deployment renders
# one; a deployment that opted into `bluesky.second_lane` renders two, one per
# target, and then "start the queue" is an ambiguous instruction about hardware
# motion until a lane is named.
#
# Two sources, and the split matters:
#
# * the lane MAP (which lanes exist, and which target each serves) is
#   render-time truth and comes from the rendered config's `services.<lane>`
#   blocks — the deployment's own statement of its shape, and the same key the
#   host reads (`mcp_server/bluesky/lanes.discover_lanes`). Session state could
#   not answer it: a lane's target does not move when a session switches;
# * the SESSION target still comes exclusively from the state file, exactly as
#   the `Target:` line does. Reading it from config would produce a confident,
#   stale answer on the one deployment shape this axis exists for.
#
# The active lane is the lane whose target equals the session target — the same
# exact-match-on-exactly-one rule the host applies, so this prompt and the tool
# that later refuses agree about which lane is addressed. Zero matches and two
# matches are both "no answer", and no answer is rendered as an explicit
# unresolved line rather than as a guess.

#: The lane every deployment has had since the plan stack shipped.

# Posture is per target (`control_system.connector.<type>.writes_enabled` over
# `control_system.writes_enabled`), so "are writes disabled here" is only
# answerable once the call has been pointed at a target. The rules themselves
# live in `osprey_target_state.writes_posture`, shared with `osprey_writes_check`
# so the deny and the missing prompt can never disagree about one deployment.
#
# What this file owns is the TARGETING: which target a given call would act on.
#
# * every ordinary write tool follows the SESSION target, from the state file;
# * a queue START binds to a plan lane instead, and the lane's target is
#   render-time truth in the rendered config — the same map the prompt's lane
#   lines read. A start naming no lane binds to the single rendered lane where
#   there is only one, which is what the tool's own `_bind_lane` does;
# * every other queue tool is left alone entirely.
#
# THE RULE THIS FILE OBEYS: DEFER IS ONLY SAFE WHERE A REFUSAL IS GUARANTEED.
# Deferring emits no decision, so the call proceeds unless some other layer
# refuses it. There are exactly two guarantors, and they cover different tools:
#
# * `osprey_writes_check` denies the session-targeted write tools. That deny is
#   the whole reason this short-circuit exists (an "ask" from here reopens
#   `can_use_tool` over it), and it is what makes a defer safe for them;
# * `queue_start` refuses in-tool, before its bridge is called, whenever the
#   bound lane's target is not armed. `writes_check` deliberately allows every
#   lane-addressed tool, so for a start THAT gate is the only guarantor — and it
#   only fires once the lane is placed. A start whose lane cannot be placed
#   therefore keeps its prompt rather than deferring into a gap.

#: Queue tools are addressed by lane rather than by the session target, and only
#: a START names one. `queue_add` composes onto an idle queue and starts nothing
#: (the server withholds the launch token, and the bridge refuses
#: `launch_token_required` the moment the queue drains), and a plain stop is
#: ungated everywhere by design. Neither has a target to resolve, and neither is
#: ever short-circuited: a prompt that vanished on a tool nobody denies would be

    # Deterministic short-circuit when this deployment is NOT armed for the
    # target this call would act on. Empirically (Claude Code SDK 2.x, not
    # source-verified): PreToolUse hook-decision aggregation does NOT honour
    # writes_check's JSON deny if this hook ALSO emits an "ask" decision —
    # aggregation appears to be any-ask-wins, not deny-dominates, when multiple
    # hooks return decisions for the same tool call. Without the short-circuit
    # `can_use_tool` fires and the unarmed invariant is violated.
    #
    # How much this defer carries depends on the render, and posture is per
    # target, so `src/osprey/cli/templates/claude_code.py` renders three ways:
    #
    # * NO target may write — every write tool is hard-denied in
    #   `permissions.deny`, which blocks before any PreToolUse hook fires. There
    #   the deny is primary and this defer is belt-and-braces against renderer
    #   drift, such as a stale `settings.json` after a posture flip without
    #   regen;
    # * EVERY target may write — nothing is rendered and nothing defers here;
    # * the targets DISAGREE — settings.json is rendered once, before any
    #   session picks a target, so a static deny would be wrong on the armed
    #   target and a static `ask` would be wrong on the unarmed one. The render
    #   therefore steps aside entirely: it denies nothing and pulls every
    #   writes-check-gated matcher OUT of `ask`. On that render there is no
    #   static gate at all, and this defer together with writes_check's
    #   per-target deny IS the whole gate — for the lane-addressed queue tools
    #   writes_check skips, the bluesky tools' own lane-bound posture re-read is.
    #
    # Three-way, and the third way is the point: a config that states no posture
    # at all falls through to normal approval, so every deployment that predates
    # the per-target key keeps exactly the prompt it has today. Only an explicit
    # `False` defers, and only where a refusal is guaranteed — see
    # `_call_write_posture`, which answers every part of that question.
