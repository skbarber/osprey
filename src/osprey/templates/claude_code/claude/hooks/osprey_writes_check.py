## Details

First gate in the PreToolUse chain. Two independent reasons to refuse, in
order:

1. **Deployment-wide read-only run.** `OSPREY_EXECUTION_MODE=readonly` means
   *the whole deployment* was launched in the read-only run posture — nothing
   a session or target does can override it. Answered from the environment
   alone, ahead of any config read, and it covers every write call — a queue
   operation staged on a writes-armed deployment included.
2. **Deployment posture, per target.** Write posture is a property of the
   machine a call would reach, not of the deployment as a whole: a facility can
   arm its virtual accelerator and leave its ring unarmed. So the question is
   only answerable once the call has been pointed at a target — the session's,
   from the state file — and the answer comes from
   `control_system.connector.<type>.writes_enabled` over
   `control_system.writes_enabled`.

The two keep separate vocabularies: a posture refusal never points the operator
at a config key, because flipping one would not lift it. A stage-2 refusal names
the key the posture was actually read from, which on a per-target deployment is
the connector block rather than the deployment-wide flag.

Which tools are writes is rendered data (`write_tools` in `hook_config.json`),
read through the shared `write_tools()` accessor with its fail-closed floor. A
facility-custom server that opts into `writes_check` arrives there as a
whole-server matcher (`mcp__<name>__.*`), and `is_write_tool` honours it — so
every tool on such a server is gated by BOTH stages, reads included: nothing in
the render can tell a custom server's reads from its writes, and the server
asked for the gate at server level.

Lane-bound queue tools skip stage 2. A queue operation is addressed by *lane*,
and the lane's own bridge refuses what it must; the session target says nothing
about it. Which tools those are is rendered into `hook_config.json` off the tool
registry rather than spelled here, so renaming one never touches this file.
Stage 1 still applies to them in full.

The rules themselves live in `osprey_target_state`, shared with
`osprey_approval` so a deny here and a missing prompt there can never disagree
about one deployment.

Both refusals are also written to the audit trail (`emit_audit`, surface
`hook_writes-check`): the posture refusal under the reason word `posture` — the
same word the MCP audit middleware and the python executor's session clamp
record for the same refusal, so one grep finds all three layers — and the
stage-2 refusal under `writes_disabled`, because a different action lifts it.
A record is written before the deny is emitted and can never cost it.
