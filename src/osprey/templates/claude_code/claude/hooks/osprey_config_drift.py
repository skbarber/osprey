description: Warns at session start when config.yml has drifted from the rendered Claude Code artifacts
summary: Catch-all so a hand-edited config.yml (or raw `claude` launch) never silently runs stale safety settings
event: SessionStart

## Flow

```
SessionStart ──► stat config.yml & .claude/settings.json
                     │
                     ▼
   (a) config.yml mtime > settings.json mtime? ──► general drift
                     │
                     ▼
   (b) config writes_enabled  vs  channel_write in deny? ──► precise drift
                     │
                     ▼
   drift?  ── yes ─► warn (stderr + additionalContext) ─► exit 0
           ── no  ─► silent ─────────────────────────────► exit 0
```

## Details

`config.yml` is a build-time input: safety-critical fields (notably the
``control_system.writes_enabled`` kill-switch, which bakes
``mcp__controls__channel_write`` into ``settings.json``'s ``permissions.deny``)
only take effect once the artifacts are re-rendered by ``osprey build``. The web
and CLI entry points auto-regenerate, but a hand-edited config.yml launched
via raw ``claude`` would otherwise run stale settings with no signal. This hook
is that signal.

Warn-only by design — it never mutates artifacts and never blocks the session
(writes stay blocked until a proper regen, which is the safe direction). It is
stdlib-only and must NOT import osprey or PyYAML: under a raw ``claude`` launch
the project venv's interpreter is not guaranteed to be the one running this hook,
so YAML is matched with a regex and JSON is read with the stdlib ``json`` module.

Fails open on any IO/parse error — stays silent and exits 0.

# A hook can be executed by whatever bare ``python3`` is on PATH — on macOS that

# annotations lazy keeps this module importable there; without it the hook dies
# at import and its whole check goes dark.
