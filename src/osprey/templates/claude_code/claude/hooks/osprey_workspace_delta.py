## Details

The SessionStart sibling (``osprey_panels_context.py``) tells the agent what the
workspace looked like when the session began.  Between turns a human can close a
tile, drag one somewhere else, or switch tabs — none of which the agent would
otherwise see without spending a ``list_panels`` round-trip on every turn.  This
hook spends nothing when nothing moved.

**Silence is the default.**  The hook writes to stdout only when the workspace
genuinely differs from the snapshot, and then only one line naming what moved::

    Workspace changed: lattice tile closed; active now artifacts.

Everything else exits 0 with byte-empty stdout: an unchanged workspace, a
missing or corrupt snapshot (reseeded first, so the *next* turn diffs cleanly),
a session id it cannot read, and a web terminal that is down.  A down terminal
is never reported as an empty workspace — an unknown workspace and an empty one
are different claims, and only one of them is honest here.

The same applies to tiles specifically: the browser reports them, so occupancy
may be unknown while the rail state is perfectly well known — nobody has ever
reported (``open_tiles_age_s`` null), or the reporting client has no dock
(``open_tiles_dock`` false) and can see the rail but not the tiles.  When tiles
go from known to unknown — the last dock-capable browser closed — the hook says
nothing about tiles and keeps the last known list in the snapshot, so a
returning browser reporting the same layout does not read as a change.

## Terminal-API authorization

The ``GET /api/panels`` call carries ``Authorization: Bearer
<OSPREY_PANEL_TOKEN>`` whenever that variable holds a non-blank value in the
environment the hook inherits — the web terminal exports it into the agent it
launches.  When it is unset, empty or whitespace-only the header is omitted
entirely rather than sent blank, matching how the server-side
``mcp_server.http._panel_auth_headers`` reads the same carrier.  Either way the call stays fail-open: a refused fetch (401
included) reads as an unknown workspace, so the hook stays silent.

## Snapshot contract

Reads and rewrites the file seeded by ``osprey_panels_context.py``::

    os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), f"osprey-workspace-{session_id}.json")

    {
      "tiles":   ["lattice", "artifacts"] | null,  # on-screen, reading order;
                                                   # null = occupancy UNKNOWN
      "active":  "artifacts" | null,               # active tab id
      "visible": ["lattice", "artifacts", "bluesky"]  # launcher-rail membership
    }

The schema is documented in full in the sibling hook, which owns it.  Both hooks
restrict ``session_id`` to ``[A-Za-z0-9_-]`` before joining it into a path, and
both derive the file name the same way — change one and the other stops seeing
the same file.

stdlib-only — must NOT import osprey, yaml, requests, or any third-party lib.
Uses only ``json``, ``os``, ``sys``, ``tempfile``, ``urllib.request``,
``urllib.error``.  Runs under ``python3`` (possibly system Python 3.9, not the
venv interpreter), so this file must be 3.9-safe.

That contract is why the web terminal's port is the one number written out
here rather than looked up: ``osprey.port_layout`` is where every framework
port lives, and this file may not import it.  The literal is the ``web`` slot
at the layout's default base — what ``default_port('web', 0)`` returns — and it
is a *fallback*, reached only when ``OSPREY_WEB_PORT`` is unset, which is the
plain ``claude`` session run beside a default-base ``osprey web``.  A
deployment that moved its block exports the variable, so the literal is never
what such a deployment dials.  It carries the ``osprey:not-a-port`` marker so
the retired-number lint reads it as the stated exception it is; move it if the
layout's ``web`` offset or default base ever moves.

Fails open on any error — stays silent and exits 0.  A user prompt is never
blocked by workspace bookkeeping.
