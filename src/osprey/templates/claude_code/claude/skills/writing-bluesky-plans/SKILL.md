# Writing Bluesky Plans

Author a new plan as a plain-text file, get it machine-validated in a
sandbox with no hardware access, then run it through the normal
author -> validate -> run -> contribute workflow. A plan you write is inert until `validate_plan` records a
pass for its exact content — nothing you author here is ever imported or
run directly.

---

## The plan-file format

A plan file is a single Python module exposing three required things (plus one
optional fourth, `render` — see *The plan's own view* below):

1. **`PLAN_METADATA`** — a plain dict with exactly three keys, all required
   (a plan missing one is rejected at load time, not defaulted):
   - `name` (str) — the plan's name.
   - `description` (str) — human-readable summary.
   - `writes` (bool) — whether the plan moves a channel (vs. read-only).
     Authoring metadata only; it has no effect on whether writes actually
     happen — that is governed entirely by `control_system.writes_enabled`.

   **Three keys is the whole dict.** Unknown keys are refused, not ignored: the
   loader parses this block with extra keys forbidden, so a stray key rejects
   the plan with an error naming it. Nothing about the channels a plan touches
   belongs here — that is declared on the `PARAMS` fields themselves (next
   section), which is the one place every consumer reads it from.

   When you author a **session** plan with `write_plan`, you do not write this
   block at all: the bridge assembles it from the call's
   `name`/`description`/`writes` and prepends it to your body. Write the block
   by hand only in a plan file installed into a facility library.

2. **`PARAMS`** — a `pydantic.BaseModel` subclass declaring the plan's own
   parameters (channel names, ranges, point counts, ...). Every field that
   carries channel names must declare what the plan does with them — see
   *Declare what the plan moves and what it reads*. Use `Field(...)`
   constraints and a `model_validator` where it helps (e.g. rejecting a
   channel named both as a moved setpoint and as a read channel).

3. **`build_plan(devices, params)`** — a callable taking `devices: dict[str,
   Any]` (resolved by string name, injected by the bridge — never free names
   in a namespace) and `params: PARAMS`, returning a bluesky generator
   (typically built with `bluesky.plan_stubs`/`bluesky.plans`/
   `bluesky.preprocessors`).

**Study the three shipped plans for the full worked pattern — do not
invent new accelerator physics:**
- `orm` (`src/osprey/services/bluesky_bridge/plans_core/orm.py`)
  — kicks each corrector channel either side of its own pre-scan working
  point, reading every BPM channel at each point, to measure an
  orbit-response matrix.
- `grid_scan` (`src/osprey/services/bluesky_bridge/plans_core/grid_scan.py`)
  — steps a set of movable channels over a rectangular grid, reading a set of
  channels at every grid point.
- `orbit_bump_sweep`
  (`src/osprey/services/bluesky_bridge/plans_core/orbit_bump_sweep.py`)
  — drives three or four correctors together in a combination whose kicks
  cancel outside the bump region, ramping a closed local orbit bump up and
  back down in steps and verifying the orbit against the requested tolerance
  band at every one — a band it first proves is wider than the machine's own
  measured noise. It is asked for in orbit space (displacements at named BPMs,
  zero at named closure BPMs) and measures the response it needs on the spot,
  so it carries no lattice model.

These three are the ONLY accelerator plan patterns this framework ships. Never
propose or author a BBA (beam-based alignment) or tune-scan plan — those two
measurements are explicitly out of scope, and `orbit_bump_sweep` does not open
that door. A closed bump is the shipped primitive those measurements would be
built *on top of*: running one through this plan is ordinary work, and wrapping
one in an alignment or tune measurement is still not on offer.

## A plan that moves a device sweeps relative, and puts it back

**Never write an absolute setpoint you did not read first, and never restore
to a literal.** A running machine is not at zero: correctors hold an
orbit-correction working point, and a magnet, mover, or phase shifter sits
wherever operations left it. A plan that drives absolute values measures
about a point the machine is not at, and one that "restores" to `0.0` does
not restore anything — it drives the machine to zero, which on a stored beam
is the orbit gone.

The idiom, per device, is three lines (`orm`'s `build_plan` is the worked
version):

```python
working_point = float((yield from bps.rd(device)))   # before the try
try:
    for step in steps:                               # steps are OFFSETS
        yield from bps.mv(device, working_point + step)
        yield from bps.trigger_and_read(all_devices)
finally:
    yield from bps.mv(device, working_point)         # never a literal
```

Read **before** the `try`, not inside it, so a device whose read fails is
never entered and the `finally` can never run without a target. Your range
parameters are then *excursions*, not absolute setpoints — say so in their
descriptions, and do not give them a magnitude ceiling of your own: what a
device tolerates is the deployment's `channel_limits.json`, which the
connector's reference monitor enforces on every write.

`grid_scan` is the deliberate exception: a grid's whole purpose is to visit
declared absolute coordinates, so it neither reads nor restores. If your
plan maps a space, follow `grid_scan`; if it perturbs a working machine to
measure a response, follow `orm`.

**The plan's name must be a valid Python identifier that does not begin with
an underscore.** A leading-underscore name is rejected at authoring time
(400), because the queue worker would never expose such a plan — the
authoring-time refusal turns a permanently unqueueable plan into one legible
error.

## A plan that verifies its own motion measures the noise first

`orbit_bump_sweep` is the exemplar for the step past `orm`: a plan that does
not merely move and read, but *checks whether the move landed* and acts on the
answer. Four rules come with that, and they are the ones an author gets wrong.

**A convergence criterion is a band around a measured reference, never an
absolute.** A stored beam is never still — every BPM carries its own noise —
so "the orbit is where I asked for it" only means something inside a band
measured on this machine, on this shift. `orbit_bump_sweep` reads
`baseline_reads` full rows before any write, takes the per-BPM mean as the
reference orbit every later reading is compared against and the per-BPM sample
standard deviation (`ddof=1`) as the noise, and then checks each step against
`±tolerance` around that reference. A tolerance narrower than twice the
measured noise is not a stricter plan, it is an unverifiable one — a band the
machine's own jitter crosses on every read — so the run fails on it **before
any sweep write**, while nothing has moved. Fail fast on a criterion you cannot
verify; never write an absolute-zero target and hope the machine sits still
for it.

**The way back down is measurement, not cleanup.** The amplitude profile walks
up and then back down in single-increment steps — `2 * num` steps
monodirectional, `4 * num` bidirectional — and each descending step short of
the terminal one is solved, trimmed and verified exactly like its counterpart
on the way up, and every step emits its own data row. That is deliberate.
Magnets do not retrace their own curve, so the descending rows are the run's
record of how far the machine actually came back at each amplitude: hysteresis
data, and the half an operator reads hardest. The same reasoning is already in
the probe — each corrector is dithered to **both** sides of its working point,
because a one-sided dither folds the hysteresis into the fitted slope. A plan
that ramps in verified steps and then unwinds in one jump has thrown away half
of what it measured and handed the machine a move it never checked.

**The terminal step re-commands the working points verbatim, and verifies
them.** The profile ends at scale `0`, and that last step is neither solved nor
trimmed: it writes the working points the plan read before the `try`, exactly
as recorded, and then checks the orbit against the band like any other step.
Its whole job is to answer "did the machine come back?", so an out-of-band
reading there is a finding to surface (`best_effort` decides whether it is
recorded or raised), never something to trim away — trimming would end the run
with the correctors somewhere other than where they started, which is the one
outcome the step exists to rule out. The `try`/`finally` restore is still
underneath it, but that is the abort-and-error backstop; the terminal step is
the *verified* return on the clean path, and a plan that verifies its motion
needs both.

**A corrector that can only move one way is unsuitable, not merely tight.** A
bump solution is a combination whose kicks cancel outside the bump region,
which means some of them come out negative whatever sign the operator asked
for, and the probe drives every corrector to both sides of its working point
before the sweep starts at all. A corrector already sitting near one end of its
range, or one the deployment's limits let move in a single direction, cannot
serve either step. Choosing a different corrector is the fix — not a smaller
`probe_amplitude`, and not a one-sided probe.

## Declare what the plan moves and what it reads

A bare `list[str]` field says nothing about what the plan will *do* to those
channels. Four annotations from
`osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.plan_fields` say it outright:

| Annotation | Field shape | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MovableChannels` | `list[str]` | channels the plan drives to a value |
| `ReadableChannels` | `list[str]` | channels the plan records without driving |
| `MovableChannel` | `str` | one driven channel, for a nested model |
| `ReadableChannel` | `str` | one recorded channel, for a nested model |
| `OptionalMovableChannel` | `str \| None` | one driven channel the operator may leave unset |
| `OptionalReadableChannel` | `str \| None` | one recorded channel the operator may leave unset |

**An optional channel takes the `Optional…` type, never `MovableChannel |
None`.** Spelled as a union at the field site, the role silently vanishes
(pydantic only reads an `Annotated` declaration when it is the outermost
annotation), and a channel with no role gets no mock, no pre-enqueue check
and no device at run time. An unset optional simply contributes no channel.

A flat list of channels, the `orm` shape:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.plan_fields import MovableChannels, ReadableChannels


class PARAMS(BaseModel):
    correctors: MovableChannels = Field(..., min_length=1, title="Correctors")
    readbacks: ReadableChannels = Field(..., min_length=1, title="BPMs")
    num: int = Field(..., ge=3, title="Number of steps")
```

One channel per nested entry, the `grid_scan` shape — annotate the **inner**
field that actually holds the name, not the list around it:

```python
class GridAxis(BaseModel):
    setpoint: MovableChannel
    start: float
    stop: float
    num_points: int = Field(..., ge=2)


class PARAMS(BaseModel):
    readbacks: ReadableChannels = Field(..., min_length=1)
    axes: list[GridAxis] = Field(..., min_length=1)
```

**The role is additive.** It records intent and validates nothing, so
`min_length`, `title`, `description` and any `x-widget` presentation hint stay
on the field exactly as you write them — the shipped plans depend on that.

**Name the fields for your machine.** The role carries the meaning, so nothing
downstream reads your spelling: `correctors`, `bpms`, `setpoint`, `readables`
are all just names. Say what the channel *is* at your facility.

**Everything downstream reads these declarations** — the load gate, the
pre-enqueue channel check, the dry run's mock devices, the `devices` dict your
`build_plan` is handed, the default figure's x axis, the pre-flight motion
summary a human approves. A channel field with no declared role is invisible
to all of them: no mock is built for it, so the dry run fails with a `KeyError`
naming the devices that *were* built. If a plan cannot find its channels, the
missing annotation is the first thing to check.

---

## Stamp the run: `scan_metadata`

Anything watching a run — the live progress readout, the figure, an operator
asking how far along a run is — reads the run's own opening metadata. A plan
that opens its own run has to put it there:

```python
from bluesky import preprocessors as bpp

from osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.plan_fields import scan_metadata


@bpp.run_decorator(
    md=scan_metadata(
        movable=params.correctors,
        readable=params.readbacks,
        points=params.num * len(params.correctors),
    )
)
def _sweep():
    ...
```

`scan_metadata` is the one function that translates your capability vocabulary
into the run's standard metadata keys, so no plan ever spells those keys
itself. `points` is the number of points the **whole run** will emit — `orm`
multiplies its per-corrector step count by the number of correctors — because
that is the denominator every progress readout divides by. Empty channel lists
or a point count below one raise `ValueError` while the plan is being built,
which is where a wrong stamp is cheap to fix.

It deliberately carries no interval count and no dimensionality hint: both are
only truthful when a run's points are one continuous traversal, and a plan like
`orm`, whose sweeps run serially one channel at a time, is not that.

**A plan that delegates to a stock bluesky plan needs no stamp at all.** When
`build_plan` returns `bp.grid_scan(...)` or another stock plan, that plan opens
the run and stamps the moved and read channels, the point count and its own
dimensionality hints — more accurately than a wrapper could. `grid_scan` calls
`scan_metadata` nowhere for exactly that reason. Stamp only the run you open
yourself.

---

## Your `PARAMS` fields ARE the queue item's kwargs

When the plan runs, its queue item's `kwargs` are the `PARAMS` fields
**unwrapped** — the field names sit at the top level of `kwargs`, with no
`params` envelope around them. The same is true of `plan_args` in the shared
draft and in every run record. Design `PARAMS` accordingly: each field is a
name an operator will see and type.

That matters for where a mistake surfaces. The bridge validates arguments
against your `PARAMS` schema **before** the item is queued, and that
pre-enqueue check is the early gate — the one that gives you a clear rejection
while nothing is moving. The worker itself only validates `kwargs` when the
plan actually *starts*, so an argument error that slips past the bridge does
not appear until the item begins running, as a failed queue item carrying a
pydantic error. Make `PARAMS` strict enough (typed fields, `Field(...)`
bounds, `model_validator` cross-checks) that the bridge can catch what is
wrong.

---

## The two gates a `writes: true` plan must clear

A plan that declares `writes: true` promises two things about itself, and both
are enforced rather than trusted. Neither gate fires for a read-only plan.

**1. It must declare at least one movable channel field.** Otherwise the plan
is quarantined at load — it never reaches the catalog, and the log carries:

```
PLAN_METADATA declares writes: true but no movable channel field in PARAMS —
a plan that changes machine state must declare which channels it moves
```

The fix is an annotation, not a metadata edit: mark the field that carries the
channels you drive as `MovableChannels` / `MovableChannel`. (A misspelled role
reads as *no* role, so a typo quarantines the plan rather than sliding past.)

**2. It must open a run and declare that run's point count.** The dry run
watches what actually reached the run, and rejects the plan with one of:

```
Dry-run gate: plan 'X' opened a run that declares no point count; a plan that
moves channels must declare its point count — pass
md=scan_metadata(movable=..., readable=..., points=...) to your run decorator.

Dry-run gate: plan 'X' declares that it moves channels but opened no run;
<same remedy>
```

Opening no run at all is the same refusal on purpose: a plan that moves a
channel with nothing recording it leaves nothing to watch live and nothing to
read afterwards. The gate reads the run, not your source, so a plan delegating
to a stock bluesky plan passes it without calling `scan_metadata` — the stock
plan already stamped a count.

---

## The allowlist the validator enforces

`validate_plan` runs your file's body through three ordered stages,
any of which can reject it outright before the next ever runs:

1. **Static import allowlist** — only these imports are permitted:
   - `bluesky.plan_stubs`, `bluesky.plans`, `bluesky.preprocessors`
     (submodule-exact — bare `import bluesky` or `bluesky.utils` is
     rejected).
   - `numpy`, `scipy`, `math`, `statistics`, `time`, `collections`,
     `itertools`, `functools`, `pydantic`, `typing`, and `logging`
     (except `logging.config` and `logging.handlers`, which are denied —
     they resolve callables by string, an import-by-string bypass).
   - Exactly four OSPREY modules, each spelled in full and imported
     absolutely: `osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.plan_fields` (the role-typed
     channel annotations and `scan_metadata`),
     `osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.figure` (the figure
     vocabulary an optional `render()` returns),
     `osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.orm_analysis` (the numeric helpers
     behind the `orm` plan's own view), and
     `osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.bump_analysis` (the response fit and
     bump solve behind `orbit_bump_sweep`). All four are inert — models and
     numeric code, no I/O and no control system. Bare `import osprey` and
     every other `osprey.*` module are rejected.
   - Everything else (`epics`, `os`, `subprocess`, `ctypes`, `importlib`,
     `socket`, ...) is rejected.
2. **CA/connector pattern scan** — rejects any body matching `caput(`,
   `caget(`, `epics.`, `aioca`, `caproto`, `write_channel(`, `read_channel(`,
   `_osprey_connector`, or `PV(`. Ordinary numeric/stdlib calls that merely
   share a method name (`numpy.put(...)`, `dict.get(...)`, `queue.put(...)`)
   are NOT flagged — channel I/O only ever happens through the `devices` dict
   `build_plan` is handed, never through a raw control-system import.
3. **Mock-device dry run** — actually builds and drives your `build_plan`
   generator to completion against in-process mock devices, in a subprocess
   with `EPICS_CA_*` neutralized. The mocks are built from your declared
   channel roles: a movable field gets a mock that can be driven, a readable
   field one that can be read. This is an authoring-quality check ("does
   it actually run"), not the containment boundary — containment is stages 1
   and 2 plus the load/enqueue/start gates that key off the validation
   record.

**Foot-gun: use `bps.sleep(...)`, never `time.sleep(...)`.** `time.sleep`
blocks the RunEngine's worker thread for its whole duration — no other plan
step, status update, or stop request can be serviced until it returns.
`bluesky.plan_stubs.sleep(...)` yields a message the RunEngine schedules
cooperatively, so the run stays responsive. `time` is on the import
allowlist for ordinary bookkeeping (computing a delay, timestamping) — it is
never a substitute for `bps.sleep` inside a plan's own control flow.

---

## The plan's own view: `render(window, params)`

A plan file may expose one optional extra: a module-level

```python
def render(window: RowWindow, params: PARAMS) -> Figure:
```

`window` is a `RowWindow` from `osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.figure` — the
rows the figure is being built from, and how much of the run they are:

| Field | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `window.rows` | the run's event `data` dicts, in emission order |
| `window.columns` | the column names those rows use |
| `window.rows_complete` | whether those rows are all the run has produced so far, or only a prefix of them |
| `window.total_seen` | how many rows the source has actually seen — never fewer than `len(window.rows)` |

`params` are the parameters the run was launched with, and the return value is
a `Figure` from
`osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.figure` — a list of `Panel`s, each carrying a
title, axis labels and units, `annotations` (short sentences saying what the
panel does *not* show), and exactly **one** mark: `LinesMark` (named x/y
series), `BarsMark` (one value per named category), or `HeatmapMark` (a
labelled 2-D grid). A panel showing two things is two panels. The bridge serves
that figure from `GET /runs/{id}/figure`, the operator's BLUESKY panel draws
it, and `get_run_figure` reads it — one view, three places.

Import the figure vocabulary **absolutely**, never relatively: plan files are
loaded by path with no parent package, so `from ..figure import ...` fails at
load time and takes the plan out of the catalog with it.

```python
from osprey.services.bluesky_bridge.figure import (
    Figure,
    LinesMark,
    Panel,
    Point,
    RowWindow,
    Series,
)
```

**A plan with no `render` is complete and ordinary.** Watchers then see the
bridge's **default view** — every numeric column the run recorded, plotted
against the one channel the plan declared it drives when there is exactly one,
and against row order otherwise — carrying the reason `no_render`. That is a
real view of real data, not a missing one, so `render()` is worth writing only
when the plan can say something the columns cannot say for themselves.

Six rules govern one:

- **Annotate the first parameter `RowWindow`.** The loader reads `render`'s
  signature, and a first parameter annotated as a list of rows — or left
  unannotated and named `rows` — is read as the retired row-list contract,
  which the loader cannot safely run: it warns, drops the render, and the
  plan itself still loads, queues and runs, so the only symptom is a figure
  that quietly stays the default view. Name the parameter whatever you like;
  the annotation is what is read.
- **Draw by position only over a complete window.** If a panel derives meaning
  from *where* a row sits — the `orm` render deciding which channel a row
  belongs to from its place in the sweep — that is sound only when
  `window.rows_complete` is true. Fall back to something position-free
  otherwise, and say so in an annotation.
- **`render()` must never raise.** A figure is a view, not a result. If it
  raises — or returns anything other than a `Figure` — the run's data is
  untouched and the bridge quietly serves the default view with the reason
  `render_failed`, but the plan's own view is gone for everyone watching until
  the code is fixed. Write it to degrade instead: guard the parts that can
  fail, drop a panel rather than the figure, and return the panels that still
  stand.
- **Stay facility-neutral.** Label panels from `params` and the row keys — the
  channel names the run actually used — exactly as `build_plan` resolves its
  devices by string name. Never hard-code a facility's channel names, PV
  strings, or a fixed channel count in the drawing code.
- **`partial` and `source` are placeholders.** `render()` sees rows, not where
  they came from, so set them to anything (the exemplar returns
  `partial=True, source="live"`) and let the route stamp the truth onto both.
- **A session-tier `render()` is never run.** It would run in the bridge's own
  process on every poll of every watching client, so it is honored only for
  plans from the reviewed, installed tiers — shipped, preset and facility. A
  session-tier file that declares one still loads, queues, runs and records
  data exactly as it would otherwise; only the drawing is skipped, and
  watchers see the default view with the reason
  `render_not_supported_for_session_plans`. Nothing about the execution
  surface changes. So write `render()` when authoring for a facility library;
  while a plan is session-tier, the default view is what everyone sees.

`plans_core/orm.py`'s `render` is the worked pattern — sweep traces first, then
the fitted matrix and its anomaly-score bars, with each stage guarded so a
failure downgrades the figure instead of losing it.

---

## Workflow: author -> validate -> run -> contribute

1. **Author** — `write_plan(name, writes, body, description="")`. `body` is
   your `PARAMS` + `build_plan` source (no `PLAN_METADATA` block — the bridge
   assembles and prepends one from your other arguments). The channels are
   NOT arguments to this call: they are the role-typed `PARAMS` fields inside
   `body`. Writes a session-tier file; reaches no hardware. Re-authoring the
   same `name` overwrites the file and drops any prior passing validation (its
   content hash changes).
2. **Validate** — `validate_plan(name, sample_args=None,
   dry_run_timeout=30.0)`. Validates the file's CURRENT on-disk content
   (never a body you pass directly) through the three stages above.
   `sample_args` should supply realistic `PARAMS` field values so the dry
   run's mock devices match what your plan expects. A pass is what makes the
   plan usable at all — an unvalidated session plan is never listed, loaded,
   or queueable.

   A pass also triggers an **upload** of the validated bytes into the queue
   worker's namespace, for that exact content hash. The response is
   `{passed, reasons, content_hash, upload}`, where `upload` is
   `{uploaded, reason, detail}`. The `passed` verdict stands regardless of how
   the upload went: a pass with `uploaded: false` is a genuine pass (a
   deployment with no queue server has nowhere to upload to), but the plan is
   not queueable until an upload lands — so keep `upload.reason`/`detail`, and
   relay them if a later `queue_add` is refused.
3. **Confirm it's live** — `list_plans()` to see the plan appear with
   `provenance: "session"` alongside its `metadata`.
4. **Run** — stage the validated plan into the shared draft with
   `set_draft(plan_name, plan_args_patch=...)` (motion-safe, no channel
   touched — it only fills the plan panel and returns a `revision`), then
   `queue_add(draft_revision)` puts that pinned draft in the queue and
   `queue_start()` begins draining it. Both consult the validation record:
   the plan's content hash is re-checked at enqueue **and** again at queue
   start, `queue_start` requires `control_system.writes_enabled` plus the
   launch token, and a human sees an approval prompt. A refusal whose
   `detail.code` starts with `session_plan_` (`session_plan_unvalidated`,
   `session_plan_not_in_namespace`) means exactly one thing: re-validate the
   plan and try again. Use `get_run(run_id)` / `get_run_data(run_id, ...)` to
   watch it, and `get_run_figure(run_id)` for the figure — the better watch for
   a plan that ships a `render()`, and still a real view of the data for one
   that does not. The `operating-bluesky-plans` skill covers this run flow in full
   — staging the complete configuration, the two-step add/start, refusal
   handling, and stopping.
5. **Contribute to the permanent catalog** — a session plan stays
   session-tier (least trusted, most ephemeral) until a human reviews it and
   contributes it into a facility catalog directory; that is a separate
   follow-up step, not something this skill or any MCP tool does
   automatically.

---

## Anti-patterns

- **Never** import or reference EPICS/CA/connector internals directly
  (`epics`, `caput`/`caget`, `_osprey_connector`, raw PV names) — all channel
  I/O goes through the `devices` dict `build_plan` receives.
- **Never** leave a channel-carrying `PARAMS` field unannotated — a field with
  no declared role is invisible to the mocks, the pre-enqueue check and the
  approval summary, and a `writes: true` plan with no movable field is
  quarantined at load.
- **Never** put channel names in `PLAN_METADATA`, or any key beyond
  `name`/`description`/`writes` — the dict refuses unknown keys, and the
  channels belong on the `PARAMS` fields.
- **Never** stamp a run you did not open — a plan wrapping a stock bluesky
  plan inherits that plan's metadata, and a second stamp would overwrite a
  more accurate one.
- **Never** use `time.sleep(...)` inside a plan body — use `bps.sleep(...)`.
- **Never** propose a BBA or tune-scan plan — `orm`, `grid_scan` and
  `orbit_bump_sweep` are the only plan patterns this framework ships, and the
  bump is a primitive to run, not a foundation to build those two on.
- **Never** write a convergence criterion the machine's own noise can cross —
  measure a reference and a per-channel noise first, check against a band
  around it, and refuse an unverifiable tolerance before the first write
  rather than discovering it mid-sweep.
- **Never** unwind a verified ramp in one move — walk it back down in the same
  increments, verifying and recording each step, because the descent is data.
- **Never** hard-code a facility channel name inside `build_plan` — resolve
  every channel by string name through the injected `devices` dict, exactly
  like all three exemplars. The same holds for `render()`: label its panels from
  `params` and the row keys, never from a name written into the file.
- **Never** let `render()` raise — guard what can fail and drop a panel
  instead, or every watcher gets the default view in place of the plan's own.
- **Never** leave `render()`'s first parameter unannotated, or annotated as a
  list of rows — the loader reads that as the retired row-list contract and
  drops the view without raising, so the plan runs and records normally while
  its own figure silently never appears.
- **Never** treat a passing dry run as proof the plan is safe against real
  hardware — it proves the plan *runs*, not that its channel motion is
  physically sound. Human approval at queue start is the real backstop.
- **Never** edit a validated plan file and then queue it without re-running
  `validate_plan` — the validation record is keyed to the file's content hash,
  so any edit drops it, and the hash is re-checked both at enqueue and at
  queue start.
- **Never** include a `from __future__ import ...` line in your body — the
  bridge always prepends a generated `PLAN_METADATA` assignment ahead of it,
  so it can never be the file's first statement (a hard Python requirement);
  modern type hints (`list[str]`, `dict[str, Any]`) work without it on
  Python 3.9+.
