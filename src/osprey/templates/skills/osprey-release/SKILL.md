  Guides a maintainer through cutting an OSPREY release on the GitHub Flow
  workflow: land the release-notes PR, tag the merge commit, push the tag,
  verify the automated PyPI publish. Use when someone says "create a release",
  "bump the version", "cut v2026.X.Y", "publish to PyPI", "tag a release", or
  asks about the release process. Composes with `osprey-contribute` for the
  notes PR. Versions follow CalVer (vYYYY.M.P) and the source of truth is the
  git tag — Hatch derives the version from it, so there is no version literal
  to bump.

# OSPREY Release Workflow

This skill cuts a properly versioned OSPREY release. Releases are CalVer tags
(`vYYYY.M.P`) on `main`; the PyPI publish runs automatically when the tag is
pushed.

The shape is:

1. Verify the working state and decide on the version number.
2. Open a **release-notes PR** carrying the CHANGELOG, RELEASE_NOTES and README
   updates (no direct push to `main` — branch protection rejects it).
3. Merge the PR to `main`.
4. Tag the merge commit and push the tag. **This is what sets the version.**
5. Verify the automated GitHub Actions workflow publishes successfully.

For the PR mechanics in step 2, defer to the `osprey-contribute` skill.

## Versioning: CalVer

OSPREY uses **CalVer**: `YYYY.M.P` where:

- `YYYY` — four-digit year of the release
- `M` — calendar month, no zero-padding (e.g., `5`, not `05`)
- `P` — patch counter within the month, starting at `0`

Examples: `2026.5.0`, `2026.5.1` (patch within May 2026), `2026.6.0` (next
month). When the year or month rolls over, `P` resets to `0`.

## The Source of Truth

**The git tag is the version.** There is no version literal anywhere in the
tree to edit — `hatch-vcs` derives the package version from `git describe` at
build time, and `osprey.version` resolves it at runtime. Tagging `v2026.7.0`
*is* the act of setting the version to `2026.7.0`.

Between releases the version reports its distance from the last tag
(`2026.6.2.post783+g83fda5e60`), which is how a development build is
distinguishable from the release it descends from.

| File | Purpose | Updated by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RELEASE_NOTES.md` | First-line title with the release version | This skill |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Add `## [vYYYY.M.P] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading; rotate `## [Unreleased]` content | This skill |
| `README.md` | "Latest Release" line with version + theme | This skill |
| `pyproject.toml` | `[tool.hatch.version] source = "vcs"` | **Do not edit** |
| `src/osprey/_version.py` | Build-time stamp, gitignored | **Never commit** |

The release.yml verify step builds the package and compares the *built wheel's*
version to the pushed tag — if these disagree, the publish fails. They disagree
when the tag is not on the commit being built, or when the checkout is shallow
(which yields `0.1.devN` rather than failing outright).

---

## Step 0: Read the CHANGELOG and decide the theme

Open `CHANGELOG.md`, read the `## [Unreleased]` section, and answer three
questions before doing anything else:

1. **What is this release about?** Pick a short theme (e.g., "plan
   authoring & branch-protection enforcement"). It goes into the release
   title, the README "Latest Release" line, and the GitHub Release body.
2. **What is the version number?** Apply the CalVer rules above. Patch bump
   for fixes, month bump for feature batches, year bump only at January.
3. **Are there breaking changes?** Check the `### Changed` and `### Removed`
   sections. If user-facing API changed, the release should call it out
   prominently and (if it would surprise users) include a migration note.

Confirm theme + version + breaking-changes status with the maintainer before
proceeding.

## Step 1: Pre-release testing in a clean venv

Your working venv may have packages that aren't declared in `pyproject.toml`.
A clean venv catches missing dependencies before users do:

```bash
python -m venv .venv-release-test
source .venv-release-test/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Unit tests (fast, free)
pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e -v

# E2E tests (~10-12 min, ~$1-2 in API calls — must use path, not marker)
pytest tests/e2e/ -v

deactivate && rm -rf .venv-release-test
```

Any failures stop the release. Fix forward, then re-run.

## Step 2: Release-notes PR

Release-notes commits cannot be pushed directly to `main` — branch protection
rejects it. Open a PR instead.

```bash
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only origin main
git checkout -b release/vYYYY.M.P
```

There is **no version literal to edit** — the tag in Step 4 sets the version.
This PR carries only the human-facing notes. Show the maintainer each diff
before applying:

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `RELEASE_NOTES.md` | First line: `# Osprey Framework - Latest Release (vYYYY.M.P)` followed by the theme tagline |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Convert `## [Unreleased]` to `## [YYYY.M.P] - YYYY-MM-DD`; insert a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` above it |
| `README.md` | Update the "Latest Release" line with version + theme |

Then run a consistency check — every line should mention the same version:

```bash
echo "=== VERSION CONSISTENCY CHECK ==="
echo "RELEASE_NOTES:  $(head -1 RELEASE_NOTES.md)"
echo "README.md:      $(grep 'Latest Release:' README.md)"
echo "CHANGELOG.md:   $(grep -m1 '^## \[' CHANGELOG.md)"
```

Now hand off to `osprey-contribute` for the rest of the PR mechanics:
`quick_check.sh` → commit (`release: notes for vYYYY.M.P`) →
`ci_check.sh` → push → `premerge_check.sh main` → `gh pr create`.

The PR title should be `release: vYYYY.M.P — <theme>`. The PR body should
include the CHANGELOG entries verbatim so reviewers see exactly what's being
released.

## Step 3: Merge the PR

After CI passes (all 8 required checks green):

```bash
gh pr merge --rebase --delete-branch
```

Linear history is required, so `--rebase`. After merge:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only origin main
```

Verify the latest commit on `main` is the version bump.

## Step 4: Tag and push

Tags can be pushed directly — branch protection covers branches, not tags:

```bash
git tag vYYYY.M.P
git push origin vYYYY.M.P
```

The tag must point at the merge commit on `main`. The `release.yml` workflow
triggers on `v*.*.*` and:

1. Builds the wheel and sdist.
2. Verifies the built version matches the tag. A checkout without full history
   builds `0.1.devN` instead of the tagged version; this gate catches that.
3. Publishes to PyPI via trusted publishing (OIDC; no token needed).
4. Creates a GitHub Release using the CHANGELOG section as the body.

If step 2 fails, the publish aborts before any PyPI write — safe.

## Step 5: Verify

```bash
gh run watch                                 # follow the release.yml run
gh release view vYYYY.M.P                    # confirm GitHub Release exists
pip install --upgrade osprey-framework       # in a fresh shell
python -c "import osprey; print(osprey.__version__)"
```

Three success signals:

- `release.yml` finished green.
- `https://pypi.org/project/osprey-framework/YYYY.M.P/` exists.
- `https://github.com/als-apg/osprey/releases/tag/vYYYY.M.P` has the CHANGELOG
  entries as the body.

If any fail, stop and investigate before announcing the release.

## Manual Publish Fallback (only if Actions is broken)

If `release.yml` is broken and the release is time-sensitive:

```bash
rm -rf dist/ build/ src/*.egg-info/
uv build
uvx twine check dist/*
uvx twine upload dist/*    # requires PyPI credentials in env
```

Then manually create the GitHub Release: `gh release create vYYYY.M.P
--notes-file <(awk '/^## \[YYYY.M.P\]/,/^## \[/' CHANGELOG.md | head -n -1)`.

This is a fallback. The default path is the automated workflow.

## Common Failure Modes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `release.yml` "Verify built version matches tag" fails | The wheel built from the tagged commit carries a different version | The tag points at the wrong commit, or the checkout lacked the history `hatch-vcs` needs. Delete the tag locally and on origin, fix, retag |
| PyPI rejects the upload as a duplicate | This version was already published | CalVer means version numbers are unique; you cannot republish. Bump the patch counter and try again |
| `gh pr merge --rebase` fails with "not mergeable" | Stale checks because `main` moved | `git rebase origin/main` on the release branch, force-push with lease, wait for CI to re-run |
| GitHub Release body is empty or wrong | CHANGELOG section heading didn't match the regex `release.yml` uses | Make sure the CHANGELOG heading is exactly `## [YYYY.M.P] - YYYY-MM-DD` |

## Out of Scope

- **Hotfix branches** — OSPREY uses GitHub Flow, no special hotfix branches.
  A hotfix is just a `fix/<short-kebab>` branch off `main`, PR'd back; then
  this skill cuts a follow-up release.
- **Release candidates / beta tags** — not currently supported by
  `release.yml`, which triggers on `v*.*.*` only. If you need an RC channel,
  the workflow needs changes first.
- **Documentation builds** — handled separately by `docs.yml`; no manual
  step needed in the release flow.
