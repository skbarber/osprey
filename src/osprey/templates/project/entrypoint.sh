#
# OSPREY container entrypoint.
#
# Six steps, in this order and no other:
#
#   1. Regen      Re-render the Claude Code artifacts that config.yml drives,
#                 and only those that have actually drifted.
#   2. Restore    Put volume-owned scaffold bodies back into the render, so the
#                 agent runs the operator's claimed artifacts rather than the
#                 framework's originals.
#   2b. Seed      Write Claude Code's missing first-run state (onboarding,
#                 workspace trust, key approval) so the first session opens on
#                 the control-room prompt instead of the CLI's own setup — and
#                 so the render's permissions.allow list, which Claude Code
#                 holds until the folder is trusted, applies from the start.
#   3. Join       Give this image an /etc/group entry for the group that owns
#                 each bind-mounted directory the render named, and add
#                 `osprey` to it — because `gosu` re-derives the dropped
#                 process's supplementary groups from that file and discards
#                 whatever the runtime granted the initial process.
#   4. Hand back  Return the state zone to the `osprey` user, because steps 1
#                 and 2 wrote into it as root.
#   5. Drop       Hand the container's real command to the unprivileged
#                 `osprey` user and get out of the way.
#
# The ordering is the point. Steps 1 and 2 write into the render, which this
# image makes root-owned so that nothing the agent can reach may rewrite the
# files that decide what the agent is allowed to do. Only root can perform
# them, and only before the server starts — so they happen here, once, and the
# process that serves requests never has the privilege to repeat them. A
# container started with `--user osprey` skips both and says so, rather than
# failing halfway through a partial write.
#
# Both steps fail open: a regen or restore that raises is reported and the
# container still starts. A container that will not boot because an artifact
# could not be re-rendered is strictly worse than one running slightly stale
# artifacts and saying so in its logs. The privilege drop is the opposite —
# a missing `gosu` is fatal, because continuing would run the agent as root,
# which is the one outcome this entrypoint exists to prevent.
#
# POSIX sh on purpose — this runs as PID 1 in a slim image and has no bash.
set -eu

# ── configuration ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# The render this entrypoint maintains is the directory the script sits in:
# `osprey build` emits it beside config.yml and .claude/, and the image copies
# the deployment repo in verbatim. Deriving the path from $0 rather than baking
# one in means the same script is correct at any /app/<name>, and there is no
# second place that has to be kept in step with the Dockerfile's COPY target.
RENDER_DIR=$(CDPATH='' cd -- "$(dirname -- "$0")" && pwd -P)

# The durable state zone, one level up from the render: the render is
# `<repo>/build` and `var/` is its sibling, which is how every runtime reader
# resolves it (utils.workspace.repo_root_for_config). The image chowns this
# whole tree to `osprey` at build time; the hand-back below restores that after
# root has written into it.
STATE_DIR=$(dirname -- "$RENDER_DIR")/var

# The interpreter that runs the maintenance step. The image installs osprey
# into its system Python (/usr/local/bin/python in the python:*-slim base), not
# into the render's .venv — a container render has none.
PYTHON="${OSPREY_ENTRYPOINT_PYTHON:-python}"

# ── logging ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every diagnostic goes to stderr, without exception. This entrypoint runs in
# front of whatever command the image was given, and that command's stdout is
# its own: `docker run <image> whoami` must print `osprey` and nothing else,
# and anything that reads a container command's output — a probe, a version
# query, a JSON payload — breaks the moment a progress line is prepended to it.
# stderr keeps the diagnostics visible in `docker logs`, which interleaves both
# streams, while leaving the command's stdout untouched.

log() {
    printf '%s [osprey-entrypoint] %s\n' "$(date -u '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')" "$*" >&2

    log "FATAL: $*"

}

# ── startup maintenance ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Regen and restore are Python-side operations on framework internals, so they
# run in one interpreter rather than two: importing osprey is the expensive part
# and doing it twice would add seconds to every container start for nothing.
# Each step carries its own try/except — including its import — so a step that
# cannot even load does not take the other one down with it.
#
# The restore is deliberately the shared `restore_scaffold_bodies`, not a
# reimplementation. Its refusal to install a reserved path lives in that
# function, which means the bare-host path and this root-privileged one are
# gated by the same code; a private copy here would be a second gate to keep in
# step, and the one that runs as root is the worst place to discover a drift.

# OSPREY_AUDIT_WRITER is a PER-COMMAND prefix on the interpreter invocation,
# never a shell `export`. It marks the records this root phase emits so they
# land in the writer's `maintenance` file rather than the app's — one uid per
# file, which is what makes an audit trail readable off disk. An `export` here
# would set it for the whole shell, and this function runs in that same shell:
# the marker would still be set at `exec gosu` below, gosu preserves the
# environment across the drop, and every record the app wrote afterwards would
# claim to come from this phase. The prefix scopes it to the one command that
# should carry it; the `unset` before the drop is the belt to this brace.

#    not disturb settings.json's mtime — the signal the SessionStart drift hook

#     raw-key provider) a key-approval prompt — questions the render already
#     answered. Trust is the load-bearing one: the rendered permissions.allow
#     list is held until the folder is trusted. Merge-only: a returning
#     operator's volume keeps every choice they made, and a file that does not
#     parse is left alone. Ownership goes to `osprey` — this phase runs as
#     root, and the volume is the dropped user's to rewrite (the state-zone
#     hand-back below covers var/, not $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, so the seed hands

# ── mounted-group membership ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `gosu` re-derives the dropped process's supplementary groups from this
# image's /etc/group. A group the RUNTIME granted — compose's `group_add:` —
# reaches the container's initial (root) process and is discarded at the drop,
# so it grants the process that actually serves requests nothing here. What
# `group_add:` still covers is every topology where that drop never happens:
# a container started with `--user`, which takes main()'s non-root branch and
# execs the command directly, so the runtime's grant is the serving process's
# only membership — and any image that runs no entrypoint of ours at all. This
# step is the grant that survives `gosu` in framework-built images started the
# normal way. The two mechanisms cover different processes; neither replaces
# the other.
#
# What needs it: the audit subdir and the facility bundle are BIND MOUNTS owned
# by a host group (setgid 2770, the group inherited from the host and never
# invented). The dropped process reaches them through MEMBERSHIP, not
# ownership — which is the whole reason the ownership sweep below leaves the
# audit mount alone. So the group has to exist in /etc/group and `osprey` has
# to be in it before the drop, and this is the only place that can be true.
#
# Which directories: exactly the ones the render NAMED, never guessed. This
# script is POSIX sh and reads no config; each service's compose
# `environment:` carries OSPREY_AUDIT_DIR (its own audit subdir) and, where
# they are mounted, OSPREY_FACILITY_BUNDLE_DIR (the knowledge bundle) and
# OSPREY_ARIEL_MIRROR_DIR (the ARIEL qmd mirror this container's own exporter
# writes). Iterating what those name and skipping any that is unset or not a
# directory is what lets one script serve a web terminal, a dispatch worker
# with no bundle mount, and a bare `docker run` with none, without a single
# special case.
#
# The gid is STATted off the mounted directory rather than passed in as env: a
# gid chosen at render time is the host's gid THEN, while the mount's is the
# only one that is true at start — and there is no second place to keep in step.

#: The gids joined so far this run. The audit subdir and the bundle commonly
#: share a group, and joining it twice is noise at best.

# ── state-zone hand-back ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Hand the state zone back before dropping. Both maintenance steps run as root
# and both WRITE into `var/`: the scaffold restore's reserved-path refusals are
# appended to the audit ledger — under `var/audit/<identity>/maintenance.jsonl`,
# because the marker above routes everything this phase records there — and on a
# fresh deployment root is the first writer, so the file is created root-owned
# 0644. The server then runs as `osprey` and records its own refusals under the
# surface that decided; the marker is what keeps the two out of one file, since
# the app user could not append to a root-owned one and the refusal recorder
# never raises, so every refusal after that would be dropped in silence. An
# audit log only root can write is worse than none, because it looks like one.
#
# Scoped to the whole zone rather than that one file: `var/` is the agent
# user's tree by construction (the image chowns it wholesale), so root leaving
# it that way is the invariant. Any future root-run startup step that writes
# UNDER var/ inherits this; a step that writes the claude-config volume or
# $HOME would need its own hand-back, because neither is here.
#
# But only the paths that are actually wrong: `chown -R` would rewrite an
# operator's bind-mounted storage under var/ on every single start, and
# deliberate foreign ownership there is a choice, not damage. `find ! -user
# osprey` narrows it to what root left behind — with the caveat that it
# matches ALL foreign ownership, so any other deliberately foreign-owned path
# under var/ needs a prune of its own, exactly as the audit subdir has one.
# Fails open like the maintenance steps —
# a container that will not start is worse than one whose audit log needs a
# manual chown.
#
# ONE deliberate exception, pruned by name: the BIND-MOUNTED AUDIT SUBDIR that
# OSPREY_AUDIT_DIR points at (`var/audit/<identity>/`, the operator's host
# directory, setgid 2770). It is excluded because the dropped process reaches
# it through GROUP MEMBERSHIP — the join above — and never through ownership,
# so there is nothing to hand back. Chowning it would rewrite a host directory
# the operator owns on every start, break host-side `osprey reset
# --purge-audit`, and blur the one property that makes the trail legible: root
# and `osprey` never share ownership of a file in the audit zone, so the uid on
# a record is evidence of who wrote it. The prune covers the subdir's contents
