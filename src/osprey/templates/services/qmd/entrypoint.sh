# Three phases, in this order and no other:
#
#   1. Startup pass   Bring the index up to date -- a full rebuild if the
#                     embedder that produced the stored vectors is not the
#                     embedder baked into this image, an incremental pass
#                     otherwise.
#   2. Serve          Start the qmd MCP daemon and the forwarder that owns the
#                     routable port, but only after the startup pass has
#                     finished AND the index is provably non-empty.
#   3. Update loop    Re-index when a corpus root's marker file advances, and
#                     on a slower interval as a fallback sweep.
#
# The ordering is the safety property: nothing outside the container can reach
# a half-built index, because the port that reaches it does not exist yet.
#
# Ahead of all three, the model files are checked against the digests this image
# was built with -- see "model verification".
#
# POSIX sh on purpose -- this runs as PID 1 in a slim image and has no bash.

# Everything the deployment can vary. The image supplies HOME, XDG_CACHE_HOME,
# OSPREY_QMD_MODEL_DIR, OSPREY_QMD_MODEL_IDENTITY_FILE and the QMD_*_MODEL pins;
# those are deliberately not re-set here, because they are how qmd finds the
# models baked into the image.

# Writable state: the qmd config and the SQLite index both live here. This is
# the directory the deployment should back with a named volume. It is kept
# separate from the model cache so that persisting the index does not shadow
# the 2.1 GB of baked models.

# Port split. qmd hardcodes `httpServer.listen(port, "localhost")` -- there is

# own network namespace. INTERNAL_PORT is where the daemon actually listens;
# PORT is the routable port the forwarder owns and clients connect to.
#
# PORT carries no fallback on purpose. The compose fragment sets
# OSPREY_QMD_PORT unconditionally from the port the deployment resolved, so an
# unset variable here means the sidecar was started outside a rendered
# deployment -- and a guessed number would publish the forwarder somewhere no
# client is looking. Fail loudly instead. INTERNAL_PORT keeps its default:
# nothing sets it, and it is the daemon's container-internal loopback port,
