"""OTEL / Claude Code telemetry env-block construction.

Builds the ``OTEL_*`` / ``CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY`` environment block that
:class:`osprey.build.claude_code_resolver.ClaudeCodeModelResolver` injects into a
launch when ``claude_code.telemetry`` is enabled. Kept separate from the
resolver's provider/model logic because telemetry is a distinct observability
concern: :func:`_build_telemetry_env` does no I/O and reads no env (all
``${VAR}``-expansion and container detection happen upstream), which makes it
directly unit-testable — see ``tests/cli/test_telemetry_env.py``.
