"""Model provider resolution for Claude Code agent deployments.

Maps canonical model tiers (haiku/sonnet/opus) to provider-specific model IDs
and generates the env block for settings.json. ``ClaudeCodeModelResolver`` does
no file or network I/O; the ``load_provider_spec`` and ``inject_provider_env``
helpers in this module do read ``config.yml`` / ``.env`` from disk.

Design: model IDs and endpoints are owned by the provider and live in
``api.providers`` in config.yml.  ``CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDERS`` defines the auth
pattern and default tier, plus fallback model IDs and base URLs for configs
that name none — config always wins over the built-in table.

        Model ID resolution order (highest to lowest priority):

        2. ``api.providers[name].models`` — the provider's own model IDs
        3. Built-in ``models`` in CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDERS (fallback)

        This means providers own their model naming: set models under
        ``api.providers`` and the framework picks them up automatically.
        No model IDs need to be hardcoded in Python.

        ``base_url`` follows the same rule: ``api.providers[name].base_url``
        overrides the built-in URL, so a facility can front a built-in provider
        with its own gateway and have the agent use the endpoint ``osprey
        health`` probes. Above both sits the break-glass env override: a
        built-in provider that declares ``base_url_env_var`` lets a set
        (non-empty) value beat config and the built-in URL, so an
        already-deployed system whose config is baked into an image can be
        redirected at a fallback gateway without a rebuild. That value is read
        only from an explicitly supplied ``environ`` — this method never
        consults ``os.environ``, because it also renders ``settings.json`` at
        build time, where an ambient read would bake the builder's endpoint
        into the artifact. The trailing ``/v1`` is stripped for
        ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` either way (see below).

        A provider that leaves a tier unmapped by all three sources is refused
        — the framework will not substitute another provider's model IDs.

        ``claude_code.default_model`` accepts a canonical tier or a model ID
        the resolved provider actually serves; anything else is refused rather
        than silently downgraded (see :func:`_resolve_default_tier`).

        Args:
            claude_code_config: The ``claude_code`` section of config.yml.
            api_providers: The ``api.providers`` section (optional).
            environ: Mapping the ``base_url_env_var`` override is read from.
                Omitted means "no override" — never ``os.environ``, so
                build-time rendering is reproducible on any machine.
                :func:`load_provider_spec` passes its ``os.environ`` +
                project-``.env`` overlay, which is what enables the override on
                every runtime path.

        Returns:
