"""Single source of truth for Bluesky MCP tool names.

The Bluesky safety wiring — kill-switch hook matchers, destructive-marker
checks, and the registry permission allow/ask lists — must never string-match
tool names inline. Inline literals make every rename a latent gate-detachment
hazard: a tool renamed in its module while a matcher in ``registry/mcp.py``
still names the previous string silently detaches a safety hook.

This leaf module holds every Bluesky tool name as registered, so the registry
gate wiring and the destructive-marker classifier can import symbols instead of
repeating string literals. It imports nothing from ``osprey`` and is safe to
import from ``mcp_server``, ``registry``, and ``agent_runner`` code.

Names here reflect the *current* registered surface. Renames are made here
first (changing a single constant), then the consumers follow — keeping every
gate attached across a rename by construction.
