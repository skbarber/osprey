# Changelog

All notable changes to the Osprey Framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/).

Versions follow `YYYY.MM.MICRO`. Year and month identify the release window;
the micro segment increments for hotfixes and same-month follow-up releases.
Compatibility is documented in release notes, not encoded in the version string.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Web-terminal roster entries can opt out of the login wall with `login:
  false` — the entry is served without authentication while every other
  terminal stays gated, and no password is provisioned for it. Meant for
  entries that front a public read-only service, like the ARIEL card.
- Profile `env.defaults` values are now seeded into the repository's `.env` by
  `osprey init` (append-only; a value already set wins), so a preset can ship
  working starting values.
- The `control-assistant` preset now deploys its web terminals with password
  login on: Alice and Bob log in with demo passwords seeded into `.env`
  (`alice`/`alice`, `bob`/`bob` — edit there, or rotate with `osprey users
  passwd`), while the ARIEL terminal stays open via `login: false`.

- Build profiles can now author the shared web-terminal context baseline at
  `web-terminal-context/base.md`, overriding the framework's copy. `osprey
  init` materializes it from the preset (the control assistant ships its own
  text), so the context every seeded user starts from is visible and editable
  in the deployment repo instead of hidden in the installed package.

### Fixed

- `osprey init --reset` no longer crashes with a Python traceback when the
  containers it would remove belong to another copy of this repo. `osprey
  reset` has always caught that refusal and rendered it; this path never did,
  so the same deliberate guard looked like a bug in OSPREY depending on which
  verb you typed. It is a refusal now, and it says what is on disk afterwards.
- The same-name-different-checkout refusal leads with its conclusion. It used
  to open with the count and the identity hashes, print one line per resource,
  and only then explain that a worktree or a second clone shares its parent
  directory's name. On a real deployment that put the explanation and the way
  out about thirty lines below the top, where nobody reads them. Now the
  finding, the other copy's path and the remedy come first, each path is listed
  once instead of once per resource, and the per-resource evidence prints under
  `--verbose`. No claim changed: it still says only what the labels prove.
- `osprey init --reset` also offers the way out that destroys nothing. `reset`
  can only suggest going and wiping the other deployment; whoever ran `init`
  asked to create something, so deploying this copy under its own name is
  named too.
- A deploy whose web terminals are unreachable now says so on the terminal. The
  warning naming the Docker Desktop remedy was emitted with `logger.warning`,
  which the altitude gate drops while a lifecycle verb owns the terminal, and
  the root logger carries no other handler. So on the one path that mattered,
  a self-heal bounce that did not help, the run printed "bounced the web
  stack ..." and then went straight to the endpoint table, which reads as
  success. It is promoted through `warn_fact` now.

### Added

- `scripts/ci/flake_report.py` ranks flaky CI tests from GitHub Actions re-run
  history. A test counts as flaky only when it failed and then passed on the
  identical commit; failures that never went green are listed separately so a
  branch bug is never filed as a flake.
- `osprey up` and `osprey restart` warn in Preflight when Docker Desktop's
  "Enable host networking" is off and the deployment has web terminals. The
  post-up probe already caught this, but only after every image was built and
  every container was up, which on a first deploy is a quarter of an hour after
  the operator could have fixed it. Read from Docker Desktop's own settings
  (its backend API, falling back to the persisted settings store), so the
  warning names the cause instead of listing suspects. A setting that cannot be
  read stays silent and leaves the post-up probe to speak.
- The post-up reachability warning now separates a forwarder that is switched
  off from a port registration the running forwarder missed. A definite "off"
  skips the self-heal restart, which cannot help, and states the cause; an
  unreadable setting keeps bouncing first and then names the setting as
  something to check.

### Changed

- The browser-facing bluesky sidecar is now the `bluesky-web` service (was
  `bluesky-panels`): it is named for its role — the web half of the bluesky
  stack, beside `bluesky-bridge` — rather than for the one panel it serves.
  Everything moves with it: the `bluesky_web:` build-profile block, the
  `services.bluesky_web.*` config keys, the compose service and image names,
  and the `OSPREY_BLUESKY_WEB_IMAGE` / `BLUESKY_WEB_URL` variables. Rebuild
  and redeploy to pick up the new names; nothing keeps the old spellings
  alive.

- Osprey now calls a bluesky plan a plan, not a scan. A plan is any bluesky
  generator — a scan is only one kind — so the word is gone from the operator
  panels, the live activity labels, the agent's tool descriptions and the docs.
  The `operating-bluesky-scans` skill is now `operating-bluesky-plans`: rebuild
  your project to pick up the new name, or the old skill file lingers in
  `.claude/skills/`. The "Run your first scan" how-to is now "Run your first
  plan" at a new URL.

- The bluesky bridge's plan-device env vars are now named for what a control
  room calls them: `BLUESKY_EPICS_MOTORS` is `BLUESKY_EPICS_SETPOINTS` and
  `BLUESKY_EPICS_DETECTORS` is `BLUESKY_EPICS_READBACKS`. Their values and format
  are unchanged. `osprey up` writes the new names; a project whose `.env` still
  holds the old ones will find them ignored, so remove those two lines (or run
  `osprey reset` then `osprey up`, which rewrites the block) to get plan devices
  back.

- The two shipped plans now name their read side `readbacks` instead of
  `detectors`, in the plan form, the queue summary, the approval prompt and the
  validation errors. A saved draft or a plan written against the old field name
  needs that one key renamed. Facility-authored plans are unaffected: a plan of
  your own may still call its read side `detectors`, `dets`, or `readables`.

- The `hello-world` preset is now the onboarding path. Its `profile.yml` leaves
  most keys unset on purpose, so each one arrives in your copy as a commented
  block you can turn on later, and its tutorial runs the agent in the web
  terminal (`osprey init` → `osprey build` → `osprey web`) instead of a terminal
  chat session.

- Lifecycle output now carries the CLI's theme. Phase openers anchor in the
  theme's primary color with a blank line before each phase, finished phases
  and durations dim so the open phase stays prominent, promoted facts and
  remedy arrows use the accent, and the closing "This deploy wrote" block
  styles its heading and file paths like the rest of the CLI. Long phases
  group their steps under quiet per-service headers (`archiver`, `ariel`,
  `personas`, `services`, …) so a busy `osprey up` reads as sections instead
  of one flat column. Piped output is unchanged apart from the new blank
  lines and group headers — color never reaches a pipe.
- Deploy output keeps one shape from start to finish. Facts a deploy used to
  print as paragraphs between phases (minted tokens, generated certificates, a
  renamed secrets file) are now one short line each in the step column, with
  the details collected into a "This deploy wrote" block after the closing
  summary. Warnings an operator must see print in the same indented `⚠` shape
  instead of as timestamped log blocks, and raw log warnings stay in the
  transcript (`-v`, file sinks) while a lifecycle command is drawing its
  progress. `osprey init --reset` now reports what the reset removed and kept
  as steps of its own phase; the full destruction plan remains what standalone
  `osprey reset` shows before asking for confirmation.

- What the CLI prints is now a progress report rather than a log. A verb prints
  the phase it is in, the steps under it, and a summary at the end; the
  timestamped `INFO` records that used to scroll past no longer reach the
  screen, though every one of them still reaches the sinks the deployment
  configures. `osprey -v <verb>` brings the whole transcript back. Warnings and
  failures read the same way in every verb now (a one-line summary, the cause
  under it, and what to do about it), and every one of them goes to stderr, so a
  script reading a command's output no longer has to filter trouble out of it.
  Under `--json`, stdout carries the JSON document and nothing else.

- ARIEL search modes are plain strings dispatched through the registry:
  `search(mode="keyword")` rather than `SearchMode.KEYWORD`. The `SearchMode`
  enum is gone, so code that imports it needs updating — the mode names
  themselves are unchanged. `osprey ariel search --mode` now takes its choices
  from the registry, so a facility that registers its own search module gets it
  as a mode without a framework change.

- Lifecycle commands no longer go quiet while they work. `osprey init`,
  `build`, `up`, `restart`, `down` and `reset` keep a spinner and a running
  elapsed under the phase they are in, and while images are building there is
  a row per service naming the step it is on, what that step is doing right
  now, and how long it has been at it; a service drops off the list as its
  image lands. Phases that have finished keep the lines they always printed.
  Where there is no terminal to repaint — piped to a file, or a CI log — each
  service still building appends a line roughly every thirty seconds instead,
  so a build that takes a quarter of an hour is never silent either way. No
  percent bars, no estimated finish times, and nothing is kept about how long
  earlier builds took.

- The agent's panel tools now say which of the two things they do. A panel can be
  on the launcher rail (reachable in one click) and it can be on screen; the old
  `show_panel` moved rail membership despite its name, `hide_panel` moved both,
  and `switch_panel` was the only verb that put anything on screen. They are now
  `add_panel_to_rail` / `remove_panel_from_rail` and `open_panel` /
  `close_panel`, each pair reversible by its partner.

- The agent's workspace tools use one word per thing. Stored records are
  `artifact_*` throughout (the parallel `data_*` family is gone, and `data_delete`
  with it), the record id is always `artifact_id`, and `artifact_delete_all` now
  requires the category to delete — it previously defaulted to deleting
  everything. The channel-finder tools are `ask_channels` (natural language) and
  `run_sql` (a query you wrote).

- Connector-level names no longer assume EPICS. The write failure code is
  `WRITE_FAILED` rather than `CAPUT_FAILED`, and `pv` is `channel` across the
  archiver, simulation and taxonomy surfaces. `ChannelMetadata` exposes
  `display_low`/`display_high`, and `channel_read` no longer advertises limits it
  discarded.

- `osprey validate` and `osprey profile validate` are one implementation, so the
  two commands can no longer disagree about whether a profile is valid.

- `IngestionScheduler.start` is now `run_forever`, which is what it does — it
  blocks until cancelled rather than starting a background task.

- Onboarding output is now written for the people who run accelerators rather
  than for the people who wrote OSPREY. `osprey init` prints the five entries
  you edit instead of a forty-line tour; the generated `profile.yml`,
  `README.md` and `.env.example` explain what each setting does and what
  changes if you alter it, rather than why it is designed that way; and
  `.env.example` now puts your provider's API key first and comments out the
  rest. The advice about setting up a CI pipeline moved from `init`'s output to
  the generated README, where it is relevant. No settings or defaults changed.

- Generated deployment repos, bundled skills, agent instructions and the
  documentation now describe the system as it is, rather than as a set of
  differences from an earlier arrangement. Guidance for moving an existing
  deployment onto the profile format is unchanged.

- Web terminal tile headers were redesigned: the bar now spans its whole tile
  (close always at the tile's right edge), sits on one seated surface whose
  hairline turns accent on the active tile, and renders one unified 24px
  control language with SVG icons. Panel names lead the bar with contributed
  text as a subtitle; on narrow tiles a contributed search collapses to its
  magnifier and remaining controls fold into a ⋯ menu instead of vanishing.
  The six-dot drag grip is gone — the bar itself remains the drag handle.

- Lifecycle commands now report what they are doing instead of scrolling their
  transcript past. `osprey init`, `build`, `up`, `restart` and `down` print one
  line per phase as they work; `init`, `build`, `down` and a detached
  `up -d`/`restart -d` finish with a summary card saying where the deployment
  stands and what to run next (an attached start ends inside the live log
  stream, so it gets none), and `osprey reset` ends with a one-line summary.
  The container build and compose output they used to stream is spooled to
  `var/logs/` — and a step that fails replays its own spool in full before the
  error, so the reason is still on the screen. `osprey -v` streams everything
  to the terminal as before.

- The BLUESKY panel's Results view leads with the run's figure. The raw data
  table sits below it behind a disclosure that names the run's row count and
  ships closed — these tables run to thousands of rows. What the table shows is
  a bounded preview, labelled with how much of the run it is withholding.
  **Export CSV**, on the same row, writes the whole run to a file: the browser's
  save dialog where there is one, the Downloads folder otherwise, and the note
  afterwards says which happened and how many rows landed. An export the bridge
  can only partly serve reports both counts rather than passing itself off as
  complete.

- `osprey users env-production` is now `osprey users env`, and the file it
  writes is `.env.users` instead of `.env.production` — the old name read as an
  environment name in a tool that has no environments. `osprey up` does the
  rename for you on the next deploy. A stack you stop before deploying again
  still carries the old name, and `osprey down` fails until it is renamed; the
  deploy guide gives the one-line fix.

- The control-assistant preset's two-user roster now ships alice as the
  write-capable operator and bob as the read-only viewer. The tiers differ
  visibly, not just in enforcement: the write-armed terminal keeps the full
  expert workspace with the EVENTS and BLUESKY panels, the read-only one gets
  a chat-first simple layout without them, both default to the light theme,
  and each browser tab is titled after its role.

- Dependency floors raised — `accelerator-toolbox`, `aiohttp`, `authlib`,
  `certifi`, `google-auth`, `openai`, `plotly`, `ruff`, `testcontainers`;
  `uv.lock` regenerated to match. `openai` is now capped below 3.x: the 3.0
  major is a client rewrite, so adopting it should be a deliberate change
  rather than something a lock refresh picks up on its own.

### Added

- A third shipped plan, `orbit_bump_sweep`, drives a closed local orbit
  bump. The bump is stated in orbit space — the BPMs the beam should move at
  and by how much, plus the BPMs it must not move at all — and the plan solves
  for the kicks of the three or four correctors you name, so there is no
  lattice model to supply. It records a reference orbit and per-BPM noise,
  probes each corrector's response, then walks the amplitude up and back down,
  trimming each step inside the tolerance band before moving on. The last step
  commands the correctors back to their recorded working points and verifies,
  rather than trims, that the machine came back. A step that will not come
  inside tolerance stops the sweep unless `best_effort` is set. An optional
  beam-current guard re-reads the current before every write batch — each
  probe, each step, each trim pass — and stops the run when it falls below a
  minimum you set. Every corrector is returned to its pre-scan value on any
  exit. The run brings its own figure: the orbit shift across the BPMs at each
  step, the residual against the tolerance band, the corrector offsets, and
  the response of any extra monitor channels the run was asked to record.

- The `control-assistant` preset now stands up a third web terminal beside
  Alice and Bob: a standalone ARIEL logbook assistant, on its own card at
  `/u/ariel/`. It shares the deployment's Postgres and logbook, and runs no
  control-system tools at all — no channel access, no Python sandbox, no scan
  queue. Existing deployments are unaffected until they adopt the new preset.

- A persona can name the landing-page section its terminals appear under, with
  `landing_group` in the `modules.web_terminals.personas` catalog. The roster
  then splits: people stay in the default section, and each declared group gets
  its own below, drawn as a panel — which is how the landing page shows a
  standalone service as something other than another login. The `users` landing
  group also takes a `label` now, so both halves can be named. Nothing else
  about a terminal changes; a deployment that sets neither renders as before.

- A `qmd` search sidecar indexes the deployment's markdown corpora — the
  facility-knowledge bundle, and a markdown mirror of the ARIEL logbook — and
  answers hybrid keyword-plus-semantic queries. It is self-contained: its
  language models are baked into the image (built locally on the first
  `osprey up`, about 2.1 GB), so it needs no Ollama on the host. The
  `control-assistant` and `ariel-standalone` templates deploy it by default;
  comment out `services.qmd` and its `deployed_services` entry to opt out. The
  endpoint carries no authentication and publishes on the project-wide
  `deployment.bind_address`, which defaults to loopback and should stay there.
  Budget about 1.25 GB of disk per 135,000 logbook entries, and expect the
  first index build to take around 40 minutes at that size.

- Facility-knowledge search is ranked when that sidecar is configured. The
  KNOWLEDGE panel and the facility-knowledge `search` tool return hits in
  relevance order with a `score`, so a question phrased in an operator's own
  words can find a document that never uses those words. Without a sidecar both
  fall back to substring matching and `score` is `null`. `rerank` under
  `facility_knowledge.search` is off by default: it costs roughly four times
  the query latency, and these surfaces are interactive.

- ARIEL gains a `hybrid` search mode and a matching `hybrid_search` tool for
  the OSPREY agent, answering over a markdown mirror of the logbook written by
  the new `qmd_export` enhancement module. The templates enable both by
  default, and both are needed — the mirror with no search mode is never
  queried, and the search mode with no mirror has nothing to read. Configure
  them under `ariel.search_modules.hybrid` and
  `ariel.enhancement_modules.qmd_export`; the search knobs must sit under
  `settings:`, as keys written beside `enabled` are ignored. `rerank` is on
  here, where ranking quality is worth the latency. Entries created through
  the ARIEL web interface or the agent's `entry_create` tool are mirrored
  inline at creation time, so they become hybrid-searchable without waiting
  for the next enhancement run.

  Filtering in this mode is best-effort: results are ranked first and the date,
  author and source filters applied afterwards, so a selective filter can
  return fewer entries than asked for even when more exist. Use `keyword_search`
  or `sql_query` when a filter has to be exhaustive.

- `osprey ariel qmd-resync` re-exports logbook entries the markdown mirror
  never saw — those written by paths that bypass the enhancement modules and
  the inline mirror write. `ingest` and `watch` run this pass themselves, so a
  routine deployment never needs it by hand. `--rebuild` clears the mirror and
  re-exports everything, which is what to reach for after `osprey ariel
  purge`.

- `close_panel` takes a panel's tile off the operator's screen and leaves it on
  the rail, so it is one click from coming back. There was previously no way to
  clear a single panel without also making it unlaunchable.

- A red CI lane now leaves evidence behind. Every Docker lane captures its
  container logs, exit codes and `OOMKilled` flags — plus runner disk and
  memory state — before teardown removes the containers, and uploads them as a
  `ci-diag-<lane>` artifact. The unit-test lane records, per parallel worker
  and flushed as it goes, which test was in flight, alongside a stack snapshot
  of every thread taken every five minutes — including after the last test, so
  a hang during shutdown is visible too. A lane that is killed rather than failing
  (job timeout, runner stall) now names the test each worker stopped on in the
  run summary, instead of ending as a silent `cancelled`. Lanes that declare a
  time budget now cap their test step below it, so a hang fails that step and
  the capture still runs, rather than the whole job being cancelled mid-teardown.

- The OSPREY agent can start a Bluesky queue on a single approval: approving
  its `queue_start` call in chat arms and runs the queue, with no separate
  confirmation step elsewhere. The token that arms a start is granted only to a
  persona configured for control-system writes that also runs the bluesky MCP
  server, so a read-only persona still cannot start anything. The BLUESKY
  panel's own **Start queue** control is unchanged.

  A deploy refuses to grant that token to a persona that is also permitted to
  run a shell: the approval gates the `queue_start` tool, not a shell, so such
  an agent could read the token out of its own environment and arm a queue with
  no approval at all. Restore `Bash` to that persona's `permissions.deny` and
  rebuild its image — or republish and re-pull it, if you deploy from a
  registry — or move the persona off the bluesky server or off writes.

- Environment now resolves from a two-tier `.env` chain. `.env.shared` carries
  the values that are the same on every host and is tracked in git; the `.env`
  beside it carries the secrets and any per-host override, and wins on any key
  both set. `osprey init` writes both. Previously a single `.env` had to hold
  both, so a shared default could not be committed without committing the file
  that held the provider keys.

- A `network:` key in the build profile attaches the dispatch pair and the
  bridges to the host network instead of the compose bridge, for facilities
  whose control system answers only on the host. `osprey build` re-reads what
  it rendered and refuses a shape that cannot start.
- `podman-compose` now works as a container provider alongside Docker Compose
  v2. OSPREY detects which one is present and shapes the deploy to match; the
  two differ in how they resolve relative paths and how they order `--env-file`
  precedence.
- An archiver read that comes back empty now says why: the response carries a
  coverage verdict — the window predates or postdates the archive, the channel
  was never recorded, or the window holds a genuine gap — with the archive's
  real bounds, so an empty answer is never a silent one.

- A virtual accelerator can now be deployed with a real archive behind it: a
  MongoDB store plus an archiver-recorder service that records the machine's
  channels as they move. Scenario history is seeded into the store when the
  stack comes up, so questions about what a channel did earlier are answered
  from recorded samples rather than synthesized at read time.
- Simulation scenarios are generated against absolute timestamps, so a
  scenario's history lands at the wall-clock times it describes instead of
  being anchored to when it was run.
- The OSPREY agent can see what is actually on screen. `list_panels` now
  reports the open service tiles in left-to-right order plus how long ago that
  arrangement last changed, and tells "nothing open" apart from "no browser
  reporting" — so the agent can work from your view instead of guessing at it.
  It is also told what changed in the workspace between turns, and told nothing
  when nothing changed.
- `arrange_workspace` sets a whole layout in one call: exactly these tiles, in
  this order, optionally focusing one — or a named layout from the deployment's
  config, the same arrangement the **Layouts** menu applies. Clicking
  **Layouts** yourself behaves as it did before.
- Docked panels now show **one** header bar instead of two. A panel embedded
  in the web terminal contributes its real toolbar controls (view switcher,
  action buttons, live text) into the tile's header bar over a new
  postMessage contract; its own top bar disappears. ARIEL, Channel Finder,
  the lattice dashboard, and System Health were curated accordingly — the
  lattice summary stats moved into the panel body, Channel Finder's pipeline
  switcher and corpus stats into a bottom strip, and the lattice Baseline
  button now asks for confirmation before overwriting.
- The rest of the docked panels moved their toolbars into that one header bar
  too. **WORKSPACE** contributes its filter, its Types/Activity switch and its
  ⋯ menu; **KNOWLEDGE** its search; **EVENTS** its Activity/Triggers tabs. A
  panel's search box now renders with the same magnifier as the terminal's own
  search, so the two read alike. In Simple view the search stays in the panel
  body, where that view puts it front and centre.
- The **PLAN** and **BLUESKY** tabs are now one **BLUESKY** panel with three
  views — Plans, Queue, Results. The queue's state and its two halts (**Stop
  after current item**, **Abort running plan**) stay on screen across all
  three, and picking a run in Queue opens it under Results. Drop `plan` from
  your profile's `web_panels` and remove any `web.panels.plan.*` override.
- `osprey -v` (`--verbose`) shows debug output, including every container
  command a deploy runs. Normal runs no longer echo those commands, so a
  deploy reads as a report — ending in the endpoint summary — rather than a
  transcript.
- Bluesky scan agents can discover the worker's device namespace: a
  `list_devices` MCP tool and a `GET /devices` bridge endpoint. Substrate
  devices are named by their control-system channel address, and `queue_add`
  now checks a plan's device names against the worker's list at add time,
  refusing unknown names with a clear error instead of failing later in the
  worker.
- CI runs the whole Bluesky scan-stack e2e family: a new agent-driven scan
  lane (ORM and grid scans executed end-to-end and graded by a structural
  floor plus an LLM judge), a queue-stack lane, and the grid-scan roundtrip
  adopted into the ORM lane — all wired into the merge gate.
- Profiles carry artifacts into a build through **convention directories** —
  `rules/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `output-styles/`, `hooks/`,
  `web-terminal-context/`, `mcp_servers/`, `services/`, and `project/` for
  anything without a home. The directory name is the declaration; there is
  nothing to list in `profile.yml`. A build warns about an unrecognized
  top-level entry, so a misspelled `rule/` no longer fails silently. `hooks/`
  is new — it installs a script into the project's `.claude/hooks/`.
- A profile can wire its own hooks into `.claude/settings.json` with
  `config: claude_code.hooks.<Event>`, naming a script the profile ships plus
  an optional `matcher` and `timeout`. Wiring is **additive**: it cannot
  remove, alter, or displace anything the generated settings already wire, so
  a declared hook is one more check on top of the framework's, never a
  substitute. A declaration is refused at build time when it names a hook the
  profile does not ship, a built-in whose wiring the framework owns, or a path
  outside `hooks/`. A persona unwires an event with
  `claude_code.hooks.<Event>: null` — an empty list merges additively and
  leaves the hook wired.
- `exclude:` now distinguishes a bare name (stop selecting the built-in) from a
  qualified `<directory>/<name>` (drop the profile's own file), so a persona
  can hand a shadowed artifact back to the framework. A bare name used where
  the profile also ships a file for it is warned about, with the qualified
  spelling that would take effect.
- `osprey init --force` re-materializes an existing repo's source zone from the
  preset — `profile.yml`, `data/`, `personas/`, `triggers.yml`,
  `web-terminal-context/`, `.env.example` — losing any edit to them. It never
  touches `.env`, `.git`, `var/`, `build/`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`,
  `ci-extra.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml` or `scripts/verify.sh`.
- The emitted `profile.yml` header now opens with a map of the repo's four
  zones — source, secrets, build output, durable state — and the
  edit → `osprey build` → `osprey up` loop that connects them.
- A profile can carry a `deploy:` block: CI platform, deploy host, and the
  container registry when the host pulls its images. Credentials are named
  there, never written there.
- `osprey scaffold ci` emits the repo's CI pipeline and post-deploy health
  check from that block. Re-running is safe — a file whose content already
  matches is left untouched, and a file the scaffolder did not write is
  reported rather than overwritten unless `--force` is given. `ci-extra.yml`
  is never touched; the pipeline includes it.
- `osprey users env-production` renders `.env.production`, the env file each
  per-user web-terminal container runs with, from the deploy config and one
  secrets file. `--output` writes it at mode `0600` instead of to stdout.
- `archiver_read` gained `bin_size=0` for full resolution — every real
  archived sample in the requested range, with no per-bin decimation. Only
  valid with `processing="raw"` (an aggregate has no bin to aggregate
  over); a non-raw `processing` with `bin_size=0`, or a negative
  `bin_size`, is a validation error.
- Bluesky scans now run in a queue server instead of inside the bridge
  process. Execution is two steps — add the composed plan to the queue, then
  start the queue — so a queue can be assembled and reviewed before anything
  moves. Adding to an idle queue needs no launch token; starting requires one,
  and with `control_system.writes_enabled` off the agent's `queue_add` and
  `queue_start` are denied outright. A queue survives a bridge restart, and a
  deployment that cannot execute plans refuses to hold items rather than
  accepting work it could never run. New guide: How-To → Run Scans Through
  the Queue.
- Emergency abort for a scan already moving hardware: **Abort running plan** in
  the BLUESKY panel, `stop_run` for the agent, `POST /queue/abort` for
  integrations. It is ungated on every surface — no launch token, no writes
  switch — so a halt stays available on a stack with writes disabled. It is
  distinct from stopping the queue, which lets the running scan finish first.
  An abort leaves hardware wherever the scan had moved it, and says plainly
  when it did not manage to stop the plan.
- An interrupted plan — aborted, halted, or failed — stays in the queue, reports
  as `stopped` (`error` for a failure) rather than as pending work, and blocks
  the next queue start until it is removed. Removing it is what unblocks the
  queue; to run it again, remove it first and then stage and add it afresh.
- `connector:` is a new top-level build-profile key and the short spelling of
  `config: {control_system.type: ...}`, so a connector can be chosen from the
  command line with `--set connector=epics`. Giving both spellings on one
  command line is an error rather than a silent last-one-wins.
- You can see what the agent did to your workspace. A tile the agent focuses
  or rearranges glows briefly, and its rail tab flashes with it, so a layout
  that changes under you is never unattributed — your own clicks stay quiet.
  An activity strip names each action in plain words ("agent opened
  WORKSPACE"), and its history popover holds the recent ones for when you
  looked away. Panels that changed while you were elsewhere keep a badge
  across a reload until you visit them. Every agent tool that changes
  something — queue and plan authoring, logbook entries, Phoebus drives,
  python execution, lattice and window management — reports itself there.

### Changed

- **A deployment is a git repo, and every lifecycle verb is top-level.**
  `osprey init` creates the repo, `osprey set` edits its `profile.yml`,
  `osprey validate` checks that profile without building, and `osprey build`
  renders `build/` from it. `osprey up`, `down`, `restart`, `status`, `logs`
  and `reset` operate the deployment; `osprey chat` talks to it; `osprey users`
  manages the web-terminal roster; `osprey scaffold ci` emits the CI pipeline.
  Each verb finds the repo by walking up from the working directory, so none of
  them is given a project or config path — `--repo` overrides the starting
  point. Running `osprey` with no arguments prints the command list.
- Dev mode is a property of the build: `osprey build --dev` bakes the local
  osprey checkout into the service images, and `osprey up --dev` starts that
  render — refusing a render built without `--dev` instead of silently starting
  the published release (`osprey up --build --dev` chains both). A plain
  `osprey up` of a dev build warns that the images carry the local checkout.
- Deployed agents can no longer reconfigure their own harness: the Claude Code
  CLI's bundled harness-configuration skills (`update-config`,
  `keybindings-help`, `fewer-permission-prompts`) are switched off in every
  rendered project, and the `setup-mode` skill (which can patch config.yml)
  left the operator preset's default roster — it stays in the artifact catalog
  for admin profiles to opt into. Rebuilt control-assistant projects will
  report preset staleness once; that is the intended signal.
- **Log out** moved into the web terminal's display menu, alongside
  **Settings** — the two now sit side by side under a line naming the signed-in
  user. The separate user chip in the header is gone, leaving search and the
  display menu there. Single-user terminals are unchanged apart from
  **System Settings** being relabelled **Settings**.
- Pairing a virtual accelerator with the mock archiver is refused — at build,
  at deploy, and at MCP server startup — because the VA moves channels for
  modelled reasons while the mock archiver invents history at read time, and
  the pair reports a past that never happened. The mock archiver remains the
  default for mock control systems; a project that pairs the two must move to
  the MongoDB archiver or to a mock control system.
- Asking the agent to open a panel no longer replaces what you were looking at.
  `switch_panel` opens the tile *beside* your current one — focusing it instead
  if it is already open — so no tile you had open is evicted. The Simple web
  UI's single workspace slot is unchanged.
- Raised minimum versions for `psycopg`, `psycopg-pool`, `uvicorn`, `rich`,
  `fastapi`, `charset-normalizer`, `unique-namer`, and `pymongo`.
- Web-terminal archives written by `osprey users remove --archive` now land in
  `<repo>/var/web_terminal_archives`, not `<project>/web_terminal_archives`.
  Archives written before this release are left where they are; move them
  yourself if you want them all in one place.
- `osprey scaffold claim` moves an artifact out of the build zone and into the
  matching convention directory of the repo's source zone, instead of marking it
  user-owned where it sits. The next build copies it back and registers it, so
  ownership is derived from what the build actually copied — there is no list
  to maintain, and an artifact a persona excludes is not owned, letting the
  framework's version render in its place.
- The profile's `.env` is where a project's secrets live. `osprey build`
  derives the project's `.env` from it and from nothing else, and a later build
  never re-reads your shell. A shell export reaches a profile only once, at
  materialization, and only for providers the profile actually references —
  keys exported for other providers are named in the summary rather than copied
  in. `osprey up` writes the credentials it mints back into the profile's
  `.env`, append-only, so a rebuild comes up on the same secrets
  instead of minting a second set the running containers do not trust.
- The web terminal's System Settings drawer explains itself. Each tab opens
  with a standing one-line subtitle, and the category help tooltips now
  describe how each kind of file is *loaded* — when it enters the session,
  what runs it, whether it advises or enforces — instead of summarizing what
  the shipped files happen to say, which went stale as soon as an operator
  edited one. Ownership prompts likewise state what taking or releasing
  ownership actually does.
- Each settings gallery now opens on artifacts rather than controls. Search and
  the category chips moved behind a `Filter` disclosure on a single muted
  summary line, and every category except the pinned ones starts collapsed.
  An active filter stays named on that line, with a one-click clear, so a
  narrowed list can never be mistaken for a short one.
- The Behavior tab labels `CLAUDE.md` "project instructions" rather than
  "system prompt": it is delivered as a message after the system prompt, while
  the output style is what actually modifies it.
- Bridge conversation history keeps more context. Replay is now bounded by the
  character budget (raised to 100k chars) rather than by turn count, which
  becomes a runaway backstop (100 turns), and a turn stays eligible for replay
  for 180 days instead of 90. Long-lived direct-message threads no longer drop
  older turns while sitting far under their size budget.
- `osprey init` now writes persona profiles as small deltas under `personas/`
  instead of full standalone copies. A file there merges over the repo's
  `profile.yml` implicitly, so edit the host profile once and every persona
  inherits the change, while each persona file keeps its own capability posture
  (e.g. `control_system.writes_enabled: false`) pinned explicitly.
  Model-selection choices baked at materialization time — and `tier` — now
  reach personas through inheritance.
- The shipped web-terminal rosters spell out `name`/`index`/`persona` on every
  user entry instead of bare-string shorthand for the first user. Behavior is
  unchanged; already-deployed projects will see a one-time profile-staleness
  advisory from the preset content change.
- The EPICS connector now rejects a `bin_size` the appliance cannot express
  rather than quietly serving a different resolution. Sub-second and
  non-whole-second widths used to be floored to the nearest second (500 ms
  *and* 1500 ms both became 1 s).
- `archiver_read`'s `access_details` payload no longer repeats the same access
  rule once per channel: 3548 → 1075 bytes for a twenty-channel read, and now
  flat in channel count rather than growing with it.
- **Breaking change: `ArchiverConnector.get_data` now returns long-format
  data instead of a shared-index wide frame.** Every archiver connector
  correctness bug fixed below traced back to forcing every requested
  channel onto one shared index, which required forward-filling gaps and
  resampling data into existence just to keep a rectangular shape.
  - **Before:** a wide `pandas.DataFrame` indexed by timestamp, one column
    per channel, reindexed/forward-filled onto a shared grid so every
    column had a value at every row.
  - **After:** a long `pandas.DataFrame` with exactly three columns —
    `timestamp` (`datetime64[ns, UTC]`), `channel` (`str`), and `value` —
    sorted by `channel` then `timestamp`. Each channel contributes only its
    own real samples (or, under a non-`raw` `processing` mode, only its own
    real per-bin aggregates); nothing is forward-filled, reindexed onto a
    shared grid, or otherwise manufactured, and a channel with no data in
    range contributes no rows. An empty result is an empty frame with the
    same three columns.
  - `value` is not dtype-constrained: `float64` when every requested
    channel's samples are numeric, or pandas' natural mixed dtype once any
    channel is non-numeric — enum/status channels (EPICS `mbbi` / DOOCS
    `DBR_STRING`: machine mode, interlock state, RF state) are archived as
    strings and round-trip as strings, never coerced.
  - `raw` processing now decimates each bin to its last **real** sample,
    keeping that sample's own true timestamp rather than a relabeled bin
    edge — matching EPICS's long-standing `lastSample_N` semantics on every
    backend.
  - The `archiver_read` artifact payload changed from a split-orient wide
    frame to `{"query": ..., "series": {"<channel>": {"timestamps": [...],
    "values": [...]}}}`. Artifacts already saved in the old layout still
    render — `extract_channel_series` normalizes all three historical
    layouts.
  - **Any out-of-tree `ArchiverConnector` subclass must be updated** to
    return the new long-format shape; downstream code no longer accepts
    the old wide, shared-index format.
- `ArchiverConnector.get_data` gained a trailing `processing: str = "raw"`
  keyword (one of `raw`, `mean`, `min`, `max`, `median`, `std`, `count`).
  It's appended last with a default, so existing positional callers are
  unaffected; an out-of-tree connector that overrides `get_data` must
  accept the new keyword (even just to ignore it) to remain
  call-compatible.
- The chat bridge how-to is now a section, `how-to/chat-bridges/`, with an
  overview page and a page per chat system. Adds a guide to connecting a
  service that does not ship with Osprey, such as Slack or email. The old
  `how-to/deploy-chat-bridge` page is gone; its content moved into the new
  Nextcloud Talk and Google Chat pages.
- Ruff moved to 0.16, pinned to one minor in the `dev` extra so the
  pre-commit hook and CI agree on formatting. The formatter skips Markdown,
  leaving documentation snippets as written.
- The `control-assistant` preset now defaults to the `virtual_accelerator`
  connector instead of `mock`, so its scans drive the soft-IOC the same stack
  already deploys and run end to end out of the box. `mock` remains the
  fallback for environments with no containers to depend on, where scans are
  browse-only — plans compose and validate, but the queue will not hold them.
  Switch with `osprey set connector=mock`.
- The Bluesky **RESULTS** panel is now **BLUESKY**, and holds the scan queue as
  well as the selected run's results. Move your own `web.panels.results.*`
  entries to `web.panels.bluesky.*`. The preset rename changes its resolved
  content, so an already-deployed project reports staleness on its next
  `osprey up`. That is the correct signal rather than noise — the tab a
  user sees is renamed — and rebuilding picks it up.
- Unknown keys in a build profile's `bluesky:` block now fail the build, naming
  the valid keys (`excluded_plans`, `plan_dir`, `port`, `tiled_enabled`,
  `tiled_port`). They used to be dropped in silence, so a typo — or a key a
  later release removed — took effect as "unset" with no warning anywhere.

### Removed

- Registry and ARIEL exports that nothing called, including a second connector
  registry that shadowed the real one.

- The `osprey deploy` and `osprey claude` command groups, the `osprey config`
  subcommands, `osprey profile new` and `profile try`, several `osprey build`
  options, and the interactive menu that bare `osprey` used to launch. What to
  run instead:

  | Removed | Use instead |
  | --- | --- |
  | `osprey deploy up` / `down` / `restart` / `status` / `build` | `osprey up` / `down` / `restart` / `status` / `build` |
  | `osprey deploy clean` / `rebuild` / `nuke` | `osprey reset`, or `osprey up --build` to re-render and start |
  | `osprey deploy decommission` / `prune` / `seed` / `passwd` / `render-env-production` | `osprey users remove` / `prune` / `seed` / `passwd` / `env-production` |
  | `osprey deploy scaffold` | `osprey scaffold ci` |
  | `osprey claude regen` | `osprey build` |
  | `osprey claude status` / `chat` | `osprey status` / `osprey chat` |
  | `osprey config show` / `export` | `osprey config --rendered` / `--defaults` |
  | `osprey config set-control-system TYPE` | `osprey set connector=TYPE` |
  | `osprey config set-epics-gateway --facility NAME` | `osprey set epics_gateway=NAME` |
  | `osprey build --tier N` / `--set K=V` | `osprey set tier=N` / `osprey set K=V` |
  | `osprey build PROJECT --preset P` | `osprey init PROJECT --preset P`, then `osprey build` |
  | `osprey profile new DIR --preset P` | `osprey init DIR --preset P` |
  | `osprey profile try` | `osprey init --preset P --up` |

  `osprey profile presets` and `osprey profile validate` are unchanged.
- The `osprey-build-deploy` skill. What it used to scaffold by hand — the CI
  pipeline, the deployment files, the post-deploy health check — is now
  `osprey scaffold ci` and the deploy verbs themselves.
- `facility-config.yml`. The `modules.web_terminals` stanza lives in the repo's
  built `config.yml`, emitted from the profile's `config:` block, and the
  deployment files come from the profile's `deploy:` block. Passing `--config`
  to `osprey scaffold web-terminals` is now an error naming both replacements;
  use `--repo`, or run from inside the repo.
- The `overlay:` profile key and the `overlays/` seed directory. Put a file in
  the convention directory that matches what it is; there is nothing left to
  declare.
- The built project's `.env.template`. `.env.example` replaces it and lists
  every variable the agent reads, not just the ones the profile declared, and
  the profile ships an identical copy so the two can never disagree.
- `osprey build` no longer harvests provider API keys out of the environment it
  happened to run in. A key now reaches a project only by way of the profile's
  `.env`, so what a build produces does not depend on the shell that ran it.
  Exporting a key still works for a host-local run and still seeds a profile at
  materialization; it no longer leaks into a built project unrecorded.
- Removed the `multi-user-demo`, `multi-user-demo-readonly`, and
  `multi-user-demo-readwrite` presets. The `control-assistant` preset ships
  the same two-persona multi-user web tier, so the demo family was a lighter
  clone of it; build from `--preset control-assistant` instead. The multi-user
  walkthrough now lives at How-To → Multi-User Support.
- Removed the DOOCS connector's `max_points` history-decimation path. It built
  a fixed `np.linspace` grid and forward-filled onto it with a zero-order hold,
  which the "nothing is manufactured" contract forbids, and no production
  caller could reach it — the connector always passed `None`.

- Removed direct execution of Bluesky plans inside the bridge process. `POST
  /runs`, `POST /runs/{id}/launch`, `POST /draft/run` and `POST
  /runs/{id}/stop` now answer `410 Gone` with a refusal naming their queue
  replacement. The queue is the only path to hardware: enqueue with `POST
  /queue/items`, start with `POST /queue/start`, and halt with `POST
  /queue/stop` or `POST /queue/abort`.

- Removed the `bluesky.demo_runner` build-profile knob and the in-bridge runner
  it switched on. A profile that still sets it now fails the build with the
  list of valid `bluesky:` keys, rather than dropping the key silently.

### Fixed

- A web-terminal persona that drops a skill by name now really builds without
  it. Persona builds decided which skill files to write from the host
  deployment's artifact list rather than the persona's own, so a persona could
  add a skill but never remove one, and the terminal shipped skills whose tool
  servers it does not run. Hooks, rules and subagents were already correct.

- The `orm` scan plan now kicks each corrector either side of where it found it
  and puts it back there. It previously drove absolute currents either side of
  zero and ended every corrector's sweep at 0 A, which is only correct on a
  machine whose correctors idle at zero — on a ring holding a corrected orbit it
  would have measured about a point the machine was not at and then dropped the
  correction. `span_a` is now the size of the kick away from a corrector's
  working point, and its 10 A ceiling is gone: what a corrector will take is the
  deployment's own `channel_limits.json`, which is checked on every write. A
  corrector whose read-back is not a number is refused before anything is
  written to it.

- The source-tree sweep behind the lifecycle criteria no longer fails when a
  file disappears while it is reading. It walks the live tree, so a temporary
  file another test had staged under `src/` could be listed and then deleted
  before its turn came, failing a criterion that was never evaluated.

- Deploys with the ARIEL logbook store no longer break on podman-compose hosts:
  the store's own `up` was the one compose invocation still built in the docker
  shape, so it aborted the deploy (or ran against the wrong project directory
  with `.env.shared` dropped) in the middle of an otherwise podman-shaped start.

- `osprey users nuke` now completes on podman-compose hosts. Its container
  teardown is built like every other compose command — rendered files, provider
  shape, pinned project directory — instead of a bare `docker compose -p down`
  only Docker can parse.

- A `$` in an `.env.shared` value now stops a deploy on every compose provider,
  not only podman-compose. Docker Compose interpolates env-file values, so such
  a secret reached containers truncated or spliced with host values, silently.

- The host-port preflight and the `osprey up` closing summary now cover any
  facility service placed on the host network, read from its
  `services.<name>.port` key. A host-mode service without that key is named in
  a warning instead of silently escaping the check.

- `osprey health --project <repo>` run from another directory now resolves the
  target repo's whole env chain — `.env.shared` included — the way build, chat
  and compose do, and the long-lived health surfaces notice `.env.shared`
  edits instead of answering from a stale environment forever.

- The release pipeline again verifies that the framework wheel's dependencies
  resolve from PyPI before anything is published; the check had been quietly
  lost when the install-docs lane switched to local wheels for PR runs.

- A control-system write whose read-back could not be verified now fails instead
  of reporting success. `write_channel` logged `Wrote <channel>` whenever the
  write itself returned, so an operator could be told a setpoint had moved when
  nothing had confirmed it.

- Panels you switch off with `auto_launch: false` no longer appear as working
  tabs. Five of the six companion panels published their URL before checking the
  setting, so the panel was offered in the rail and its iframe returned a 502.
  The same five now also survive an empty `OSPREY_<PANEL>_PORT` in a compose
  file, which used to kill the launch outright and leave a dead tab.

- `osprey health` runs from a subdirectory of your project, like every other
  `osprey` verb, and its panel probe honours `OSPREY_<PANEL>_PORT` — so on a
  multi-user deployment it checks each user's own panel rather than reporting
  everyone's as down.

- The `vllm`, `deepseek`, `ollama` and `argo` providers now ship a base URL that
  can actually be reached.

- New projects reach Argo again. The scaffolded `config.yml` pointed at
  `https://argo-bridge.cels.anl.gov`, which no longer serves; it now uses
  `https://apps.inside.anl.gov/argoapi/v1` and reads `ARGO_BASE_URL`, so you can
  redirect a deployed project at another gateway without editing the file.

- The CLI reference described a `--project` option on `osprey web` that the
  command does not have. It takes `--repo`.

- Logbook watch results keep `entries_updated`, which was dropped between the
  service and the CLI, so an update reported as zero changes.

- A `host`, `port` or `auto_launch` key written at the wrong nesting depth is now
  refused with the correct path, instead of being silently ignored — which used
  to start a panel you had switched off, or bind a port you had not asked for.

- Per-user web terminals now receive ARIEL's database password. Without it, the
  ARIEL tab reported the database as unavailable and the agent's logbook tools
  failed, on a deployment whose database was running and healthy: the password
  `osprey up` mints never reached the containers, so both authenticated with the
  shipped default instead. Each user whose persona configures ARIEL is now given
  it, and a persona that configures none is not.
- A start now creates ARIEL's schema for a database it brought up itself, and
  writes the active scenarios' logbook entries when the logbook is empty. Until
  now nothing on the deploy path created the tables — that lived only behind
  `osprey ariel migrate`/`quickstart` — so a first start left a database with no
  tables behind a panel that could not say so usefully. An existing logbook is
  left untouched, and a database that cannot be reached warns and names the
  command that finishes the job rather than failing the deploy.
- A start that would generate store credentials a surviving data volume cannot
  accept now stops before it starts anything. Deleting a deployment directory
  leaves its volumes behind, so the next `osprey up` minted fresh passwords for
  postgresql, openobserve and mongodb — which each read their password only
  when initializing an empty volume, and go on rejecting the new one. The
  previous warning could only guess that this might be happening; the start now
  asks the container runtime, names every affected store at once, and says
  whether each one's original credential can still be recovered. It reports
  this before the image build instead of at a health probe minutes later —
  which matters, because starting the stack recreates the store containers, and
  a container holds the only copy of the credential its volume was created
  with. `osprey restart` runs the same check before it stops anything, for the
  same reason.
- New: `osprey up --reuse-stores` and `osprey restart --reuse-stores` adopt
  those volumes instead of discarding them, restoring each store's original
  credential to `.env`. They refuse if any affected volume can no longer be
  reopened, rather than starting a stack that is part-adopted and part-doomed.
- New: `osprey init --reset` starts over on a name that has been used: it
  destroys the containers, volumes and images left by a previous deployment of
  that name, and re-materializes the source zone as `--force` does when the
  repo directory still exists — so re-creating a deployment is one command,
  with no `rm -rf` first. Provider keys in `.env`, git history and the audit
  log survive, exactly as they do under `--force`. If anything of that name
  survives the sweep, `init` stops and says so instead of starting: `reset`
  removes only what carries the checkout's own label, so a deployment created
  before that label existed has to be cleared by hand once.
- Dev deploys now report each service image as it finishes building, instead
  of one summary line after the whole `compose build` — the longest step of a
  deploy, and previously silent for its entire duration.
- The EVENTS tab now works in a multi-user deployment. Its dashboard is
  bearer-gated, but per-user terminal containers never received the dispatcher's
  token, so the tab loaded and then reported "No triggers are registered." — for
  a dispatcher that had every trigger loaded. Users whose persona declares the
  EVENTS panel now get the token in their own container; personas without the
  panel, such as a read-only tier, deliberately still do not.
- The event dashboard no longer claims a dispatcher has no triggers when it was
  simply not authorised to read it. Both trigger views now say they were
  refused, and a panel opened inside the terminal is told its terminal has no
  token rather than to open the tab it is already in.
- `osprey health` now answers from either stance. It looks for the config where
  a build writes it (`build/config.yml`) and reads credentials from the repo's
  `.env`, so running it at the repo root no longer reports the config missing,
  and pointing it at the render no longer runs the provider canaries and the
  environment scan with no credentials loaded.
- Container detection now recognizes Podman's `/run/.containerenv`, not only
  Docker's `/.dockerenv`. Inside a Podman deployment the derived MCP health
  probes were aimed at host URLs.
- `osprey set` now says so when a key is not one the profile recognizes. The
  key is still written, but the profile schema is closed, so the next
  `osprey build` refuses the whole profile — which used to be the first hint,
  reported against `profile.yml` rather than against the command that made the
  edit. Keys addressing the rendered config (`config.…`) are unaffected.
- A dispatch worker whose `agent_data.base_dir` is an absolute path now mounts
  its workspace volume where the worker actually writes. The mount target was
  re-anchored under the project directory, so the volume landed on a path
  nothing used while the records went to the container's writable layer and
  were lost on every recreate.
- Several messages and rendered comments still named commands the redesign
  removed — among them the refusal `osprey up` raises when `.env.production`
  is missing, which pointed at `osprey deploy render-env-production` instead of
  `osprey users env-production`.
- A scan-stack deployment no longer intermittently refuses every scan with
  "not in the list of allowed plans". The bridge opens the Run Engine worker
  once at startup, and abandoned it whenever it won the boot race against the
  queue server — leaving the list of runnable plans empty until someone started
  the queue by hand. It now waits for the queue server to answer first.
- One operator's tab switches no longer rearrange every other window of the
  same workspace: a human panel focus is now mirrored to the server silently
  (the agent can still read where the operator is looking) instead of being
  broadcast back, whose delayed echo could evict tiles the operator had open —
  in the gesturing window and in every other one. Closing a tile no longer
  reports its side-effect focus change either.
- Web terminal panels no longer freeze permanently — rendering but ignoring
  every click — when a drag from the panel rail loses its end event (for
  example the dragged entry was removed mid-drag by the agent or another
  client). Drag cleanup now has document-level failsafes.
- The web terminal's panel event stream reconnects after a proxy or backend
  hiccup and re-syncs rail membership on every reconnect, so a browser that
  missed events while disconnected converges instead of silently drifting.
  Event-handling errors are now logged instead of swallowed.
- Workspace gallery: the "Draft created" confirmation no longer sticks as a
  permanent full-panel overlay after a successful logbook submit.
- Workspace gallery: deleting the artifact being viewed fullscreen (locally
  or agent-side) exits fullscreen instead of stranding a pane with no
  controls.
- The web terminal welcome screen wires its dismiss controls before any
  fallible boot step, and a terminal-library load failure degrades the
  terminal card instead of aborting the whole page boot.
- Lattice dashboard summary stats (energy, tunes, chromaticity) no longer
  freeze at load time — they recompute with the fast figures after a magnet
  change. Also removed dead panel chrome the audit surfaced: ARIEL's unwired
  "Connected" indicator and the System Health panel's no-op manual refresh
  and misleading fetch-time timestamp.
- The **EVENTS** panel drew two header bars when docked — its own, plus the
  tile's. It now hides its own, like every other panel.
- On Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows), `osprey up` now repairs a web stack that
  is fully healthy yet unreachable from the browser. Docker
  Desktop forwards a host-network port only if it watched the container open
  it, so a container that restarted while Docker Desktop itself was starting
  stays invisible from the host — and re-running `osprey up` could never fix
  it, because nothing in the container's definition changed. The post-deploy
  reachability probe now restarts the web stack once and re-checks before
  pointing at the host-networking setting.
- A deploy is quieter about things that were never wrong: no more
  orphan-container warnings for its own sibling stack (two compose
  invocations share one project by design), no more garbled progress
  rendering on long service names (docker runs use `--progress plain`), and
  no more platform-mismatch warning for the virtual accelerator on Apple
  Silicon — that image is amd64 by design (its Channel Access server has no
  arm64 wheels), and the compose service now declares it via
  `platform: linux/amd64`, overridable with `OSPREY_VA_PLATFORM`.
- Importing the control-system connectors no longer drags in pandas. The
  connector factory imported the archiver base eagerly for a type annotation,
  so anything that wanted only `osprey.connectors.control_system` had to
  install the archiver's dataframe stack to import it at all.
- A secret containing `$` no longer reaches a container truncated. Compose
  substitutes `$` sequences inside env-file values, so `secret$abc` arrived as
  `secret` and `P@$$w0rd` as `P@$w0rd` — while the file on disk still read
  correctly, leaving a login that refused for no visible reason. `osprey up`
  now refuses such a stack and names the offending variables (never their
  values). All three files a deploy reads secrets from are checked —
  `.env`, `.env.production` and `.env.auth` — including ones OSPREY did not
  write itself, so a CI-built `.env.production` and a hand-added OIDC client
  secret are covered. `osprey users passwd` checks before storing a new
  password.
- The OIDC section of the multi-user guide named `.env` as the file to put
  client credentials in. It is `.env.auth` — credentials placed as documented
  never reached the login service.
- Editing `.env.auth` by hand (the documented way to add OIDC client
  credentials) now takes effect on the next `osprey up`. On podman the
  login service previously kept running with the old file's contents —
  healthy-looking but rejecting every login — until it was recreated manually.
- Lint now refuses a roster `oidc_subject` containing `$`. The subject travels
  through the rendered compose file, where `$` sequences are rewritten, so
  that user could never log in and nothing said why.
- The settings drawer's `CLAUDE.md` section now has a help tooltip. Its help
  text was filed under a category name no gallery ever displays, so the button
  silently never rendered — on the one artifact that matters most.
- The settings Config tab's form view no longer hides most of `config.yml`. It
  listed a `python_execution` section that does not exist (the section is
  `execution`), so execution settings were reachable only through Raw YAML;
  `archiver`, `logbook`, and `facility_knowledge` are now editable there too.
- Enum/status channels no longer render a state the channel was never in. A
  gap in an enum channel (a `null` sample) was being turned into the literal
  category rung `"<channel>: null"` on the chart's shared category axis, so a
  disconnect drew as a real state. Gaps now break the line as they always did
  for numeric channels. The same axis also had its tick labels clipped by a
  fixed right margin and drew an off-theme gridline per rung; both fixed.
- `raw` and the aggregate processing modes now place bin boundaries on the same
  lattice. `raw` decimation anchored its bins to the Unix epoch while the
  aggregates anchored theirs to the start of the day, so for any `bin_size`
  that does not divide a day evenly (7 s, say) the two disagreed — an operator
  comparing `raw` against `mean` over one window got bins that did not line up.
  Whole-second widths that divide a day, which is every width the framework had
  been exercised with, are unaffected.
- The archiver freshness health probe stopped silently discarding sub-microsecond
  precision. It converted each sample's timestamp through `to_pydatetime()`,
  which emits `Discarding nonzero nanoseconds` on every EPICS probe run.
- The timeseries table's header came from a different HTTP request than its
  cells — the header from `format=chart`, the rows from `format=table`. For an
  artifact being written while it is viewed the two can disagree, showing values
  under the wrong PV name. `format=table` now returns the very column list its
  rows were built from, and the client uses it.
- The artifact gallery's info-bar totals are now computed server-side and
  reported under a new `summary` object on `format=chart`. The client had been
  summing each channel's own point count, a number that cannot be reconciled
  with the table's unioned row count — only the server sees both axes.
- The EPICS Archiver Appliance connector formatted query-window bounds
  with a literal UTC `Z` suffix without actually converting to UTC first,
  so at any facility whose `system.timezone` is not UTC every
  `archiver_read` window against EPICS landed hours away from the one an
  operator actually asked for — e.g. "the last hour" could silently pull
  data from several hours in the past or future, depending on the
  facility's UTC offset. EPICS now converts to UTC before the query
  reaches the wire. MongoDB and DOOCS did not share this regression
  through the actual `archiver_read` path — the tool always hands
  `get_data()` a timezone-aware datetime, and pymongo's BSON encoding and
  `datetime.timestamp()` are each already correct for an aware datetime
  regardless of its zone — but both connectors (and the mock/simulation
  archiver) now call the same `to_utc()` helper as EPICS, hardening the
  connector-level contract for a caller that bypasses the tool: a naive
  (timezone-less) datetime passed directly to `get_data()` is now read as
  facility-local rather than depending on the caller's own zone or
  assuming UTC, consistent with every other connector.
- `archiver_read`'s `processing` parameter (e.g. `mean`, `min`, `max`) was
  accepted and echoed back in the response, but never actually applied to
  the query — a request for a 60-second mean silently returned the same
  last-sample-per-60-second data as `processing="raw"`, with no error or
  warning. `processing` is now honored end-to-end: the EPICS connector
  pushes the aggregation to the Archiver Appliance server-side, and
  MongoDB/DOOCS/mock apply it client-side, so the values returned actually
  match the requested aggregation.
- The MongoDB archiver connector ANDed a `$exists` condition for every
  requested PV onto the same query, so a request spanning channels
  archived in separate documents — a common ingestion pattern — matched no
  documents at all and silently returned an empty frame with no error, as
  if none of the channels had ever been archived. It also ignored
  `precision_ms` entirely (returning every raw document at ingestion
  cadence regardless of the requested bin width) and treated `timeout=0`
  as "no timeout given," silently substituting the connector's default.
  The query now matches any document carrying at least one requested PV
  (`$or` instead of ANDed per-PV `$exists` checks), `precision_ms` is
  honored via per-channel resampling, and an explicit `timeout=0` is
  respected rather than overridden.
- `DOOCSArchiverConnector.check_availability` built its "everything
  unavailable" result when the connector was disconnected, but never
  returned it, so execution fell through into querying the live DOOCS ENS
  anyway — a disconnected connector could still report channels as
  available instead of cleanly reporting all of them unavailable. The
  disconnected guard now returns immediately.
- Plotting an archiver artifact that mixes channels with and without data in
  the requested window no longer fails. A channel with no samples produced an
  untyped (object-dtype) column, and Plotly Express refuses a wide frame
  "with columns of different type" — so `px.line(data)` over "beam current
  plus a channel that was down" raised instead of drawing the channel that
  did have data. Empty channels now carry a `float64` column.
- `data_read` on an over-cap archiver artifact now previews the long-format
  payload it actually receives. It recognized only the old wide/split-orient
  shape, so a `{query, series}` file — the common reason for exceeding the
  100 KB inline cap — fell through to a bare `json_object` preview listing
  `["query", "series"]` and nothing else. The preview now reports channel
  names, total and per-channel point counts, and each channel's first and
  last sample, including the zero-sample channels that explain a missing
  trace.
- The session-report skill's reference file still taught the pre-long-format
  Chart.js recipe (`data: { labels: timestamps, datasets: [{ data: values }] }`).
  `archiver_downsample` gives every channel its own timestamps, so a
  multi-channel report built from that recipe drew each series against the
  first channel's x-values — a plausible-looking chart that was silently
  wrong. The recipe now maps per-dataset `{x, y}` points, skips enum/status
  channels that cannot share the numeric axis, and needs no date-adapter
  script.
- The DOOCS connector no longer fails when its configured `avg_window` is wider
  than the queried time span. The moving average used `np.convolve(mode="same")`,
  which returns `max(len(data), window)` points rather than `len(data)`, so the
  returned `data` array outgrew its `time` array and `get_data` died with a
  length mismatch. The average is now a pandas centered rolling mean, which
  returns one value per input point and shrinks the window at the edges instead
  of zero-padding — removing the separate edge-renormalization pass as well.
- Plotting two or more enum/status channels together no longer draws them on
  interleaved rungs. They share one categorical y-axis, and Plotly builds that
  axis's rungs from the union of its traces in first-appearance order, so each
  channel's step line crossed rungs belonging to the other — rendering as a
  state the channel was never in. Each channel's rungs are now namespaced to it;
  hover still shows the real, unprefixed value.
- The artifact gallery's `format=table` view no longer rebuilds the entire
  timeseries on every page click. It pivoted every (timestamp, channel) cell in
  the file and then sliced to the 50-row page, against a 200 MB file cap; only
  the requested page's rows are built now. The shared timestamp axis is still
  unioned in full — that is what the row count and page offset are measured
  against — but that is one entry per timestamp rather than one per timestamp
  and channel.
- The EPICS connector now honors two contract rules it documented but did not
  enforce, both reachable only through the connector API directly (not through
  `archiver_read`):
  - Aggregating a non-numeric channel with anything but `processing="raw"` now
    raises `ValueError` naming the channel, as `base.py` and the add-a-connector
    guide both require. EPICS pushes aggregation to the appliance and so never
    reached the client-side helper where the other three backends enforce this —
    `mean` over a string-valued PV came back as its raw `CW`/`STANDBY` values
    labelled as means.
  - A `precision_ms` that is not a whole number of seconds is now rejected
    instead of floored. The appliance's operator syntax takes seconds, so a
    500 ms request was silently served at 1 s (and 1500 ms likewise), while every
    other backend binned at exactly the width asked for.
- A DOOCS connector configured with `avg_window` no longer manufactures its
  timestamps. Because the moving average was a fixed-width convolution kernel,
  it needed a constant `dt`, so setting `avg_window` forced the samples onto a
  `numpy.linspace` grid via a zero-order hold — every returned timestamp was a
  grid position rather than an archived one, and every value was forward-filled
  onto it. `get_data` deliberately bypasses that grid, but `avg_window` brought
  it back through a config key, so the one connector with a smoothing knob was
  also the one still violating the no-manufacturing contract. The average is now
  a real time-duration window applied to the archived samples at their own
  irregular timestamps. An explicit `max_points` still returns a uniform grid —
  that is what the caller asked for.
- The DOOCS connector no longer waits forever when `get_data` is called without
  an explicit `timeout`. It passed the argument straight to `asyncio.wait_for`,
  where `None` blocks indefinitely, and had no configured default to fall back
  on — so an unresponsive ENS hung the caller with no recovery. `connect` now
  accepts a `timeout` config key (default 60 seconds), matching EPICS and
  MongoDB. An explicit `timeout=0` is still honored as a real request.
- The mock archiver is now genuinely reproducible, as its docstring always
  claimed. Noise for every non-BPM channel was drawn from the unseeded global
  `numpy.random` instead of the per-PV generator, so two identical queries in
  one process returned different data; and the per-PV generator was seeded from
  `hash(pv_name)`, which CPython salts per process, so even the seeded path
  differed between runs. Seeding now uses a stable checksum and all noise comes
  from the per-PV generator.
- `data_read`'s over-cap preview now also unwraps the legacy `_osprey_metadata`
  envelope, matching the plot tools' reader. Older archiver artifacts on disk
  carry that wrapper and were previewed as an opaque JSON object.

- Built projects' `config.yml` no longer misplaces section comments: entries
  added at build time (service blocks, `deployed_services` names, web panels,
  config overrides) rendered *after* the next section's comment banner —
  splitting the `deployed_services` list around the `SAFETY CONTROLS` header.
  Appended entries now render inside their own section, with the banner kept
  at the section boundary.

- The test suite no longer inherits a `TZ` supplied by a `.env` file, which made
  `tests/connectors/test_archiver_timezone.py` error on any machine whose system
  timezone differs from the one in `.env`. CI has no `.env`, so it never saw it.
- Importing an `osprey` module no longer loads `.env` into the environment.
  Previously any `import osprey.…` rewrote `os.environ` from whatever `.env`
  sat in the working directory — or, through LiteLLM, in any parent directory —
  overriding values the caller had set. `.env` now loads only where an
  application asks for it: the `osprey` CLI, MCP server startup, and the Claude
  Code launch paths. Every key is still passed through, unchanged, at those
  points. Code that imports OSPREY as a library and relied on the side effect
  must call `osprey.utils.config.load_project_dotenv()` itself.
- The `nextcloud_bridge` block in a generated `profile.yml` described itself as
  turning "a Nextcloud folder" into a trigger source. It answers questions from
  a Talk room; the comment now says so.
- Deleting an artifact from the gallery, and the dispatch worker's retention
  sweep, no longer show up as agent actions in the web terminal's activity
  strip. Only mutations the agent actually performed are reported.
- The python executor tools now reject `execution_mode` values other than
  `readonly` and `readwrite`. An unrecognized spelling used to slip past both
  write gates and run write-pattern code even with
  `control_system.writes_enabled=false`. The deployment-level kill switch also
  now covers `execute_file`, which previously had no such check.

- BLUESKY panel views taller than the window can be scrolled again. The panel's
  layout column grew to fit its content instead of staying at the viewport, so
  the scroll container had nothing left to scroll and everything past the fold
  was unreachable — worst in an embedded tile, where the overflow was clipped
  outright. Embedded panels also no longer lose the last 28px of every view to
  padding the frame already supplies.

- The axes table in a scan's parameter form no longer truncates device names —
  its columns are sized to the names they hold.

- The web terminal header names the product once. The page title repeating it
  alongside is gone.

- An embedded status strip now keeps its own inset. The queue badge sat against
  the tile frame and the halt buttons touched its corner, while the content
  below them was comfortably inset.

- The session picker's dropdown opens in front of the terminal rather than
  behind it. The tab strip it is adopted into clipped the menu and pinned it
  under the content pane whatever its stacking order; it now mounts at body
  level and closes on scroll, resize, Escape, or a click outside.

- The ORM figure reads as a signed response matrix. A corrector kicks the beam
  and a BPM downstream reads positive or negative by phase advance, but the
  matrix was painted on a single-hue ramp anchored to the raw extent: zero
  landed mid-ramp, so an unresponsive BPM looked like a real response, and the
  strongest negative response painted faintest. It is now diverging about zero
  and scaled against a symmetric max|value|, so equal and opposite responses
  read as equally strong and two runs stay comparable. Cells with no reading
  are hatched rather than left blank, and the legend became a colorbar carrying
  the numbers.

- New: an ORM result carries the two views that conventionally accompany a
  response matrix. **Response by BPM** reads the matrix column-wise, where the
  sign oscillation is legible and a dead corrector shows as a flat line against
  a dead BPM's shared spike; you pick which correctors are drawn without
  refetching. **Singular values** plots the spectrum on a log axis, with modes
  at or below the numerical-rank tolerance drawn as gaps rather than as the
  ~1e-16 residue a rank-deficient matrix leaves behind. The raw per-corrector
  sweeps move below the fit into a collapsed section that shows one corrector
  at a time; when the fit is skipped they stay inline.

## [2026.8.0]

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `osprey build --emit-profile` is gone, with no alias — the
  build command builds projects, and profile authoring now has its own verb.
  Materialize a profile directory with:

  ```
  osprey profile new DIR --preset X
  ```

  It writes everything the flag wrote, plus the preset's `data/` tree, and
  accepts the same `-O` / `--set` layers. Scripts still passing the old flag
  fail with an unknown-option error rather than silently doing something else.

### Changed

- A profile directory is now the durable source of truth for a deployment.
  `osprey profile new` writes a fully explicit, standalone `profile.yml` — the
  preset's resolved configuration (including any `extends` chain) materialized
  with its comments preserved, nothing inherited at build time — alongside the
  preset's `data/` tree copied verbatim and an `overlays/` seed. `--set` and
  `-O/--override` values are baked in place, so a validated build one-liner
  carries straight into an editable facility profile. Edit the profile
  directory and rebuild; the project stays a regenerable artifact.
  `osprey profile validate DIR` checks a profile without building, and
  `osprey profile presets` lists the bundled presets.

- The framework version is now derived from the git tag instead of a literal in
  `src/osprey/__init__.py`. A build between releases reports its distance from
  the last one (`2026.8.0.post12+g83fda5e60`) rather than claiming to be that
  release, in `osprey --version`, the status line, the web terminal health
  payload, and generated project READMEs. Cutting a release is now just tagging
  — there is no version to bump.

- `osprey deploy up` and `osprey build` now refuse to pin
  `osprey-framework==<version>` when running from a development checkout, since
  no published release corresponds to that code. Use `--dev` to build and stage
  a local wheel, or set `OSPREY_PIP_SPEC` to pin explicitly. Previously this
  emitted a pin for a version that was never published and failed later, inside
  the image build, with an opaque pip error.

- Web terminal header: the username badge and the logout button are now one
  identity chip on the right, whose menu holds the deployment name and Log out.
  The deployment name (`web.app_name`) moved to the left, beside "Web Terminal".
- Custom artifact-gallery categories moved from the top-level `categories`
  key into the `artifact_server:` block (`artifact_server.categories`), in
  both build profiles and rendered config.yml — the bare name was ambiguous
  next to unrelated notions like `health.categories`. No alias: the old key
  is no longer read. The profile-side block also accepts `host`/`port`/
  `auto_launch` overrides for the gallery server. Materialized profiles now
  include commented guidance for adding facility `mcp_servers:` and
  `artifact_server.categories`.
- Building the `control-assistant` preset now generates the virtual
  accelerator's channel manifest from the data tree the build sources, and
  writes `VA_CHANNELS_FILE` and `VA_LATTICE` into the project `.env`. The
  simulated machine therefore serves the channels in your profile's databases
  rather than the container's packaged fallback set. Both keys are rewritten
  on every rebuild, so an edited channel database reaches the running IOC.

### Fixed

- Providers that ship a default endpoint (ALS-APG, Stanford) now work without a
  `base_url` in config. The requirement check ran before the provider could
  supply its own default, so a config that omitted `base_url` failed with
  "Base URL required" instead of using the endpoint the provider already knew.
  An explicit `base_url`, and the environment override, still take precedence in
  that order.
- A run whose steps each wrote a file with the same name (two `plot.png`, say)
  now delivers all of them to a chat bridge. Previously the second overwrote the
  first in the shared upload directory and both were reported as delivered, so a
  plot went missing with nothing in the logs to say so.
- `web.theme` set to a concrete theme id (e.g. `desy-light`) now actually pins
  light or dark as the deployment default. It painted correctly and was then
  overridden by the viewer's OS preference a moment later. A bare family
  (`desy`) still follows the OS, and a user's own pick still wins over both.
- The theme picker now labels the DESY family `DESY` rather than `Desy`.
- Newly scaffolded projects set `web.theme: osprey`, a family that no longer
  exists; the terminal warned and fell back on every start. Now `main`.
- HTML-to-image export no longer runs `playwright install chromium` on every
  conversion. The browser availability check used Playwright's sync API, which
  fails inside a running event loop; the failure was misread as "browser
  missing", so an async caller (e.g. the dispatch artifact byte route) paid a
  subprocess and a network round-trip per conversion — and on hosts that cannot
  reach the browser CDN, every conversion failed even with Chromium installed.
  The browser launch is now itself the availability check: Chromium is installed
  only when a launch reports the binary is absent, at most once per process, and
  a launch that fails for any other reason surfaces unchanged instead of being
  reported as a missing browser.
- `osprey build` now fails with an actionable error when
  `claude_code.default_model` (e.g. `--set model=...`) names a model the
  selected provider does not serve. Previously the build only warned and the
  deployed web terminals crash-looped behind the reverse proxy (502).
- Chat bridges no longer drop an artifact whose conversion failed. A run's
  artifact descriptors predict `image/png` for everything the worker intends to
  render, but a conversion that fails at fetch time makes the byte route serve
  the original file instead — and a delivery path routing on the prediction
  rejected those bytes as "not a PNG" and discarded them with no error anywhere.
  Delivery now routes on what actually arrived (the bytes and the served
  Content-Type), so a failed render is delivered as a document rather than lost,
  and its filename takes the extension of what was served. The same prediction
  drove prior-image re-injection, which could hand the agent a text file
  labelled as an image on a follow-up question; a prior artifact is now
  re-injected under the type it was really served as, or not at all.

### Added

- Web terminal workspace: every panel tile now has the same header bar — six-dot
  drag grip, panel name, and a close button that closes just that tile (the
  panel stays on the rail; one click reopens it). Panels can be opened side by
  side as first-class gestures: drag a rail icon into the workspace to split
  exactly where you drop it, or use the ⊞ "open in a new tile" corner on a rail
  entry's hover. Opening an already-open panel beside moves its tile instead of
  duplicating it.
- A multi-user web-terminal deployment can now require a real login. Set
  `modules.web_terminals.auth.method` to `password` (passwords OSPREY manages
  and hashes for you) or `oidc` (your facility's single sign-on, mapped onto
  roster entries by an `oidc_subject` field), and every request to a user's
  terminal — pages, APIs and the live connection — is refused unless the
  browser holds a valid session for that user. `osprey deploy up` provisions
  each user's password hash into a `0600`, gitignored `.env.auth` that only the
  login service can read, printing any password it has to generate exactly once;
  `osprey deploy passwd <user>` rotates one later and ends that user's sessions.
  It fails closed throughout: without `tls.enabled` the deployment refuses to
  render rather than send session cookies in the clear (override with
  `auth.allow_insecure_http` only behind a TLS-terminating proxy), and a deploy
  aborts before starting anything if a password hash cannot be established. The
  default stays `auth.method: none`, and no preset turns it on — see the
  multi-user how-to for the full setup and how to roll it back.
- Each user in a multi-user deployment can have their own default theme: set
  `theme:` on a roster entry in `modules.web_terminals.users` (a family such as
  `desy`, or a concrete id such as `desy-light` to also pin light/dark). It
  overrides the image's `web.theme` for that user only, and the user's own pick
  in the display menu still overrides it.
- The multi-user landing page now uses the deployment's configured theme
  instead of a fixed palette, so it matches the terminals it links to.
- DOOCS facilities can now select their connectors by name: `control_system.type:
  doocs` and `archiver.type: doocs_archiver`, in `config.yml`, through `osprey
  config set-control-system doocs`, or from the interactive config menu.
  Previously the connectors shipped but were reachable only by spelling out their
  dotted class paths. Both still require `doocs4py` from the DOOCS environment.

- New `osprey.bridges.core` package: a channel-agnostic engine for connecting a
  chat or email channel to the OSPREY dispatcher/worker pair as its own process.
  It owns the parts that are the same for every channel — a crash-safe dedup
  claim taken before dispatch, conversation history replayed with each question,
  a retry queue drained in the background once the pair is healthy again, startup
  recovery for messages that were in flight when the process stopped, and worker
  artifact handling. A channel contributes only its wire format and platform I/O,
  through the `ChannelOps` seam.
- Your team can now ask the agent questions from a Nextcloud Talk chat room and
  get answers — including plots and files — back in the same room. Add a
  `nextcloud_bridge:` block to a build profile alongside a `dispatch:` block, set
  the bot account and room list in the project `.env`, and `osprey deploy up`
  brings up the bridge with the rest of the stack. In a group room only messages
  that mention the bot are answered; files are shared with the room's members
  rather than published as public links. Messages posted while the bridge is down
  are picked up on restart. See the "Deploy a Chat Bridge" how-to.
- Your team can now ask the agent questions from Google Chat — in a space or a
  direct message — and get answers, including plots and files, back in the same
  thread. Add a `gchat_bridge:` block to a build profile alongside a `dispatch:`
  block, set the Google service account key, subscription, and app identity in
  the project `.env`, and `osprey deploy up` brings up the bridge with the rest
  of the stack. In a space only messages that @mention the app are answered; in
  a direct message every message counts. Plots and files come back as public
  links anyone who has the link can open, because that is the only way Chat can
  show them; leave the bucket unset to answer text only. Run one bridge per
  subscription — Google hands each message to a single reader. See the "Deploy a
  Chat Bridge" how-to.
- Every service image is now overridable through the same `env → config →
  default` chain: new `OSPREY_POSTGRES_IMAGE` env var plus
  `services.postgresql.image`, `services.openobserve.image`, and
  `services.bluesky.tiled_image` config keys (the built service images already
  supported both layers). Useful for internal registry mirrors and pinned
  digests.
- Service compose templates are now claimable build artifacts: `osprey
  scaffold claim services/<name>` freezes a template for local editing (with
  `scaffold diff` drift reporting), and `osprey build` skips claimed services
  when refreshing templates from the framework.
- `osprey deploy up` now mints a strong per-deploy `ARIEL_DB_PASSWORD` into
  `.env` when the postgresql service is deployed; the container and the ariel
  DSN read the same value (previously both used the fixed `ariel` password).
  Existing Postgres volumes keep their original password — see the deploy
  how-to for the migration note.
- Simulation machine files accept two optional per-channel keys: `noise_abs`, an
  absolute Gaussian sigma in the channel's own units, and `texture`, slow
  baseline motion declared as `{"kind": "wander", "amplitude": …, "period_s": …}`.
  The existing `noise` key stays relative (a fraction of the value), so channels
  that sit at zero can now be given movement. Machine files using neither key
  parse and behave exactly as before.
- Build profiles take a new `environment:` block declaring the Python
  environment agent code runs in: `python` (the base interpreter — either a
  bare interpreter or a venv's), `packages` (extra requirements, additive to
  `dependencies`), and `inherit_exclude`. Where `python` names a venv, that
  venv's installed distributions are frozen into the built project's dependency
  record; basing on a venv interpreter does not otherwise carry its packages
  over. The build fails, naming every offender at once, on packages it cannot
  reproduce — ones installed from no package index, and ones whose version
  conflicts with osprey's own requirements. `inherit_exclude` is how you drop
  them.
- A CI-enforced guard keeps `config.yml` honest: every key the shipped templates
  render must have a reader in the framework, or a recorded reason it has none,
  and a key that was retired cannot come back in a template, a preset override,
  or the loader's defaults. Contributors can run it from a checkout with
  `uv run python scripts/check_config_keys.py`.
- `osprey theme-lab` opens a browser workbench for designing a theme: pick its
  two accent colors — the main one and the second used for highlights and
  warnings — see them previewed live in dark and light with contrast badges,
  then copy an export block describing the theme to request it. One set of
  controls edits whichever accent is selected. The second accent carries a
  contrast badge of its own, because the build holds it to the stricter
  body-text standard the main accent is not held to.

### Changed

- The event dispatcher panel is rebuilt around two tabs — Activity and
  Triggers — instead of five surfaces competing for the same screen. There is
  one place to fire a trigger, one trigger list, and one operator (Simple)
  view. Three long-standing faults go with it: timeline marks now sit at their
  actual times (every mark previously rendered at the left edge, so a quiet
  trigger looked the same as a busy one), an open transcript survives the
  three-second refresh instead of collapsing what you had expanded, and write
  actions no longer pop a token prompt inside the embedded panel. A run now
  also links to the trigger that started it and, where a telemetry store is
  deployed, to that run's own records — each link appearing only when there is
  something real to open.
- Raised minimum versions for `aiofiles`, `click`, `fastapi`, `httpx`,
  `matplotlib`, `mss`, `playwright`, `requests`, and `typing_extensions`, and
  regenerated `uv.lock` to match.
- `osprey web` now resolves the project it serves once, up front (`--project`,
  then `OSPREY_CONFIG`, then the current directory) and refuses to launch when
  no `config.yml` is resolvable, instead of silently serving a terminal with
  only the universal panels. The launch banner names the resolved project, the
  resolved config is published to child processes (including the `--reload`
  worker), and a detached server's command line always carries `--project` so
  a copied restart cannot lose the project identity.
- Every draggable divider in the web terminal now looks and behaves the same.
  Panes sit flush against each other with the grip attached to the pane edge
  (previously the workspace gallery and the plan panel floated their panes in a
  gutter), every divider can be moved with Arrow keys as well as the pointer,
  and double-clicking one collapses that pane and restores it to the width or
  height you had. The lattice dashboard's control sidebar, which could only be
  collapsed, can now be resized too.
- `osprey deploy --dev` now fails with a clear error when the local osprey wheel
  cannot be built, instead of warning and deploying the pinned PyPI release.
  Previously a missing `build` package (or a broken local checkout) produced one
  warning among many info lines and an exit code of 0, so the containers came up
  running released osprey and the deployment silently tested something other than
  the local code. The preconditions — editable install, source checkout, `build`
  package — are now checked before any deploy work begins, and `build` moved from
  the `dev` extra to a base dependency so an editable install always has it.
- `osprey build` now prints a provider-credentials summary that reports the API
  keys it *found*, not just the ones it didn't. It leads with the provider the
  project was built for, names where that key came from (project `.env`, the
  build directory's `.env`, or the shell), and warns if the selected provider's
  key is missing. Previously the build logged one line per *unresolved*
  placeholder — twice — so a successful key was silent, and a missing key for
  the selected provider looked identical to the irrelevant misses for providers
  the project never uses. The per-placeholder resolver line moved to `DEBUG`.
- Scaffolded `.env` / `.env.example` files derive their provider API-key list
  from the provider registry instead of a hand-maintained list (which had
  drifted: `ALS_APG_API_KEY` was missing, a stale Langfuse block remained, and
  a detected `ARGO_API_KEY` value was discarded in favor of a `$${USER}`
  placeholder).
- Shipped preset configs now document `deployment.bind_address` and point the
  Virtual Accelerator instructions at `osprey deploy up` instead of a
  repo-internal container path.
- Deploying the Bluesky bridge with `control_system.writes_enabled: true`
  no longer leaves the launch path permanently unarmed — `BLUESKY_LAUNCH_TOKEN`
  is now minted for every deployed bridge. The enforced boundary is unchanged:
  the connector re-reads `writes_enabled` and applies limits on every setpoint.
- `execution.execution_method` now names the backend that actually runs:
  `subprocess`. Generated configs write it, `local` is accepted silently as a
  synonym, and `container` still loads but runs on the subprocess backend and
  logs a one-time deprecation warning naming the config file it came from. Both
  legacy values stop being accepted in 2027.1.
- Generated `config.yml` files no longer record `execution.python_env_path`, an
  absolute host interpreter path that went stale as soon as the project moved.
  Agent Python runs in the project's own `.venv` when it has one, resolved at
  run time. Configs that still carry the key load unchanged; it is ignored.
- Other Jupyter-era execution keys nothing reads are gone the same way:
  generated configs no longer carry `execution.modes`,
  `python_executor.max_generation_retries` / `max_execution_retries`, or
  `file_paths.executed_python_scripts_dir`, and an `execution.modes` block in
  an already-deployed config is ignored on load. A config without an
  `execution:` section no longer logs a warning — subprocess execution is the
  default, not an anomaly.
- The unreachable Jupyter-container execution machinery is deleted: the
  container engine, the wrapper's container mode, the notebook/file managers
  (and the `http://localhost:8088` notebook links they minted), their models
  and exception hierarchy, and the artifacts API's interactive-notebook
  endpoint. `osprey.services.python_executor` now exports only the analysis,
  limits-validation, and serialization utilities the subprocess backend uses.
- The Python-execution and visualization tool descriptions now name the
  packages actually importable where each one runs code, enumerated once at
  server start, instead of a fixed `numpy, pandas, scipy, at, matplotlib,
  plotly` list. The visualization tools report the sandbox's installed set
  intersected with its import allowlist. If the environment cannot be
  enumerated, the description names no packages rather than guessing.

- The model-benchmark matrix now scores two lanes separately: `agentic_benchmark`
  marks genuine model-capability e2e tests (the headline pass rate) and
  `harness_benchmark` marks model-independent safety/plumbing assertions, so
  harness passes no longer pad a model's capability score. Every in-scope e2e
  test must declare its lane (gated per matrix cell and in CI); 19 non-LLM e2e
  files moved to the matrix exclusion list. The `e2e_benchmark` marker was
  renamed to `channel_finder_benchmark` to say what it actually covers.
- Web terminal header: the Expert/Simple toggle and theme controls are collapsed
  into a single display-menu dot that opens a popover with appearance
  (light/dark), view, and theme-family pickers. The header's search box and the
  display menu — System Settings included — now look and behave the same in both
  Expert and Simple, so nothing in the top-right corner moves when you switch
  view; the standalone "?" button is gone (the safety guide is still one search
  away). The popover also stays open while you switch appearance, theme, or
  view, so you can flip back and forth without reopening it.
- The default theme family is now named **main** (it was `osprey`): use
  `web.theme: main`.
- Workspace gallery browser: the three stacked header rows (title/count bar,
  type filter chips, controls row) are collapsed into a single toolbar —
  filter input, Types/Activity toggle, and a `⋯` menu holding the rare
  actions (all-sessions scope, refresh, layout). The all-sessions scope shows
  as a dismissible pill above the list while active, and pinned artifacts are
  promoted into a "Pinned" section at the top of the type tree.
- The **high-contrast** family is now fully monochrome — pure black and white,
  with status, diffs, chart series and terminal colors separating by brightness
  instead of hue. It was previously a high-contrast variant of the pre-redesign
  palette, and still meets the same WCAG AAA gates.

- A config that does not say which control system it talks to now gets the mock
  connector instead of EPICS, with a warning naming `control_system.type`. The
  same rule applies to the archiver: a missing or blank `archiver.type` resolves
  to the mock archiver — previously a missing one selected the EPICS archiver and
  a blank one crashed. The `hello_world` and `project` templates now ship a
  minimal `archiver:` block so the choice is visible. Configs that name their
  connector and archiver are unaffected.
- `claude_code.default_model` is resolved in three ways and never silently
  substituted: unset uses the provider's default tier, a tier name
  (`haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus`) selects that tier, and a model ID the provider's
  tier map declares is used verbatim. Anything else is now an error that
  names the valid tiers and the provider's model IDs. Previously an unrecognized
  value — a stale model ID, or one belonging to a different provider — was
  quietly replaced by the provider's default tier, so a project asking for Opus
  could run Haiku with nothing in the log. *Migration:* if a build now fails on
  this key, set it to a tier name (which stays valid when the provider changes)
  or to one of the model IDs the error lists. The shipped presets now set the
  tier `haiku`.
- A provider that maps no model for a tier is refused at build time, with the
  `api.providers.<name>.models` block to fill in. Unmapped tiers were previously
  filled with Anthropic's own model IDs, so a proxy or gateway shipping no map
  launched the agent asking for a model it does not serve.
- `api.providers.<name>.base_url` now overrides the built-in endpoint for
  built-in providers too, matching how the model map already worked — a facility
  fronting a shipped provider with its own gateway gets the agent pointed at the
  endpoint `osprey health` probes.
- `ariel.database.uri` is optional. With it unset, the DSN is derived from the
  project's `services.postgresql` block (username, database name, host port, and
  the `ARIEL_DB_PASSWORD` the deploy mints), so moving the database port no
  longer means editing a second copy of the same facts; the templates no longer
  render a hardcoded `uri:`. An explicit `uri` still wins verbatim, as does the
  older `connection_string` spelling (honored, with a warning naming its
  replacement), and `osprey health` now cross-checks an explicit loopback DSN
  against `services.postgresql.port_host`.
- Virtual Accelerator gateways that declare no `port` now follow
  `services.virtual_accelerator.port` instead of a hardcoded `5064`, so moving
  the deployed soft-IOC's port moves the connector with it. An explicit gateway
  port still wins; the templates no longer render `port: 5064`.
- The mock archiver derives `simulation_file` from the control system's own
  simulation file when its own key is unset, so archived history and live reads
  come from one machine model. An explicit archiver-side value still wins, and a
  disagreement between the two is warned about.
- `osprey health` reports configuration more honestly: an empty
  `deployed_services` list is a skip rather than a warning (attached and
  service-free projects ship it empty), the timezone remediation names
  `system.timezone` in `config.yml` instead of a `TZ` variable that no longer
  clears it, the container checks query the runtime `container_runtime` selects
  rather than whatever auto-detection finds first, and the agent-data check reads
  `agent_data.base_dir`.
- `facility.name` is the canonical facility identity, read the same way by the
  build path and by every interface that labels its UI; presets now set it in
  the `facility:` block. A top-level `facility_name` still works as a fallback.
- `agent_data.base_dir` is the single key naming the agent-data directory. The
  runtime, the health check, and the compose mounts all resolve the same
  directory from it, and generated configs declare it explicitly.
- Logbook composition uses the project's configured provider —
  `logbook.composition.provider`, falling back to `claude_code.provider` — and
  fails with a clear error when none is configured, instead of always calling
  Anthropic. The model ID comes from that provider's tier map;
  `logbook.composition.model_id` is no longer written into generated configs but
  is still honored to pin a literal ID.
- `ariel.enhancement_modules.semantic_processor.provider` is required when that
  enhancement is enabled, and an unset one is an actionable error rather than a
  silent fall-through to `ariel.embedding.provider` (which defaults to `ollama`,
  an embedding endpoint, not a completion one). The duplicate nested
  `model.provider` key is gone; the module-level `provider` is the only one.
- `claude_code.telemetry.protocol: grpc` combined with an auto-derived
  OpenObserve endpoint now fails the build. OpenObserve serves HTTP only, so
  that pairing produced an exporter that dropped every metric and log silently.
- The artifact gallery tab appears only when its server is actually running:
  with `artifact_server.auto_launch: false`, or after a failed launch, the
  WORKSPACE tab is unavailable instead of an enabled tab whose iframe returned a
  bare 502. Every companion panel's host and port now come from one resolver, so
  the URL published to the terminal and the port the server binds cannot
  disagree, and the `OSPREY_*_PORT` overrides apply on both sides.
- `facility_knowledge.bundle_path` resolves identically for its three readers
  (the MCP server, `osprey knowledge`, and the KNOWLEDGE panel): `~` is expanded,
  and a relative path is resolved against the directory holding `config.yml`.
- The control-system wizard disables the MongoDB archiver choice when the
  `archiver-mongodb` extra is not installed, naming the install command, instead
  of writing an `archiver.type` the environment cannot construct.
- The agent's setup-mode config patcher reports `control_system.writes_enabled`
  as a cold change requiring `osprey claude regen` and a restart. It was
  advertised as taking effect immediately, so an operator who flipped it
  in-session was told writes were live while the connector and the enforced deny
  list still blocked them.
- A project that still sets
  `control_system.write_verification.fail_on_mismatch: true` gets a one-time
  warning at its first write. Nothing ever read that key: a failed verification
  does not block or roll back a write. `write_channel_checked()` is the path
  that enforces verification, and scan plans write through it.
- The web terminal's settings drawer edits the write-verification level
  (`control_system.write_verification.default_level`) as a dropdown of `none` /
  `callback` / `readback`. Its enum was attached to a key shape that does not
  exist, so the live setting was previously edited as free text.
- Generated configs now document keys that were previously discoverable only in
  the source: the panel-port block for every web panel a project ships, the
  `web_terminal:` and `hooks:` blocks, `bluesky.plan_dirs` trust tiers, the three
  channel-finder pipeline modes, `development.api_calls`, and `web.theme`.
  Comments that described behavior the code does not have were corrected —
  including the safety surface: how far `approval.default_policy` actually
  reaches (only tools whose matcher runs the approval hook; everything else is
  gated by the rendered `settings.json` permissions), all three effects of
  `hooks.debug` and its unrotated JSONL, the warning that
  `control_system.patterns` overrides rather than extends the built-in patterns,
  and what `control_system.write_tools` covers.


### Removed

- The `apex` theme family.

- Configuration keys that nothing read are retired — from the shipped templates
  and presets, and from the framework's own config classes and loader:
  `control_system.write_verification.{enabled,fail_on_mismatch,timeout}`,
  `approval.tools.channel_limits`, `control_system.connector.timeout`,
  `connector.mock.simulate_delays` (the mock's real knobs are `response_delay_ms`
  and `noise_level`), the `machine_state:` block and its unused reader,
  `channel_finder.explicit_validation_mode`, the channel-finder `benchmark`,
  `processing` and `tree_preview` sub-blocks,
  `file_paths.{agent_data_dir,user_memory_dir,execution_plans_dir,prompts_dir}`,
  `workspace.base_dir`, `api.providers.ollama.{host,port}`,
  `ariel.{reasoning,default_max_results,cache_embeddings}`, the `applications:`
  block, and `system.facility_name`. An existing `config.yml` that still carries
  any of them keeps loading, silently and unchanged — retired keys are tolerated,
  not fatal; they simply have no effect. Two exceptions:
  `write_verification.fail_on_mismatch: true` warns once at the first write, and
  `file_paths.agent_data_dir` is no longer read at all, so a non-default value
  there now resolves under `./_agent_data` — move it to `agent_data.base_dir`.
- The configuration the loader hands to the runtime no longer fabricates
  OpenWebUI-era identity fields (`user_id`, `chat_id`, `session_id`,
  `thread_id`, `session_url`) or the `applications` / `current_application`
  scoping that went with them. Nothing read the identity fields; the
  `applications` scoping was read only to resolve per-application `file_paths`
  overrides, which no shipped template ever declared.
- Scaffolded projects no longer create `_agent_data/user_memory/`, and `.env`
  no longer carries a `TZ` line detected from the host — the facility timezone
  is `system.timezone` in `config.yml`.


### Fixed

- Dragging the horizontal dividers in the events panel no longer lags behind the
  pointer. The timeline pane animated the same height the drag was setting, so it
  eased toward a target the cursor had already left and trailed by up to 85
  pixels for the whole gesture.
- `osprey build` no longer aborts partway through creating a project's virtual
  environment on a slow connection. Installing osprey's dependencies was capped
  at five minutes, which a first-time download can exceed, and the build stopped
  with an unexplained "Unexpected error". The limit is now generous enough for a
  full download, and if it is ever reached the message names the install as the
  step that ran long and suggests what to try.
- Dispatched runs that delegate to a subagent now wait for the delegated work
  and return the full answer. Previously the reply could stop at "the agent is
  searching, I'll notify you when it completes" and nothing further arrived.
- `osprey web --project <dir>` launched from outside the project now behaves the
  same as running `osprey web` inside it. Previously the flag only set the
  terminal's working directory, so the project's `.env` was never loaded
  (leaving `${VAR}` placeholders such as a provider `api_key` unexpanded), the
  project's `web_terminal` and `claude_code` settings were replaced by built-in
  defaults, and `_agent_data/` was created next to wherever the command was run.
- A built project's container image now installs the same package set as its
  host environment — both are rendered from the project's own recorded
  dependencies. Previously the image was built from a separate list, so a
  package the agent could import on the host could be missing from the
  deployed image.
- Agent Python execution works in a freshly built project. Any
  `execution_method` other than the literal `local` fell through to a
  Jupyter-container backend that OSPREY does not ship, so execution failed;
  the subprocess backend is now the only path.
- A dispatched agent run no longer starts before its MCP servers finish
  registering. The servers connect asynchronously, so a run whose first turn
  fired during that window saw none of the project's tools and answered "I
  don't have that tool" — indistinguishable, after the fact, from the model
  declining to use them. The worker now waits for the project's declared
  servers to report connected before sending the prompt, as interactive runs
  already did. A server that never registers is logged and the run proceeds.
- Turning off a telemetry content gate (e.g.
  `claude_code.telemetry.log_assistant_responses: false`) now writes an
  explicit `OTEL_LOG_*=0` into the deployed environment. Previously the
  variable was simply omitted, and Claude Code's own fallback chain could
  re-enable capture the config had turned off.
- ARIEL logbook ingestion no longer skips an otherwise-valid entry when the source
  payload omits its `id`: the ALS and generic adapters now fall back to an empty
  entry id (matching the JLab/ORNL adapters) instead of raising a `KeyError` the
  fetch loop caught and dropped the entry on.
- All artifact stores are now rooted at the shared data root, so artifacts saved
  from session-scoped writers (e.g. resumed web-terminal sessions) stay visible to
  the gallery.
- `artifact_focus`/`artifact_pin` now report gallery failures honestly instead of
  always claiming success.
- `web.app_name` in `config.yml` now actually labels the web terminal header: the
  runtime read the key from a nested section nothing generates, so only the
  `OSPREY_WEB_APP_NAME` env override worked. It now reads top-level `web.app_name`,
  matching `web.theme` and `web.presets` (env override still wins).
- A server-configured `web.theme` family now survives a visitor's first page load:
  the in-browser theme runtime adopted the default family on first visit instead of
  the configured one. Light/dark still follows the OS until the visitor picks a mode.
- How-to documentation refreshed against the current code: provider model IDs,
  deploy/build semantics (`--force` preservation, `--dev` image builds, full
  subcommand list), telemetry now documented as on-by-default, MCP/executor error
  contracts, and the ARIEL web-interface module tables.
- Presets that render Claude Code artifacts now ship the `osprey_focus_validate.py`
  and `osprey_panels_context.py` hooks their `settings.json` already referenced;
  existing rendered projects will be flagged stale and pick up the two hooks on
  regeneration.
- Simulated channels sitting at a `0.0` baseline no longer read back as dead-flat
  constants. Relative `noise` is multiplicative, so it vanishes at zero and BPM
  positions and corrector current readbacks declared noisy were perfectly still —
  in live reads and in synthesized history alike. Mock and Virtual Accelerator
  reads now put an absolute per-kind floor under the noise (a `noise_level` of
  exactly `0.0` still means deterministic), machine files can declare `noise_abs`
  and `texture`, and loading a machine file that declares relative noise on a zero
  baseline now warns and names the affected channels.
- Synthesized archiver history is pointwise deterministic: each sample's noise is
  keyed to its channel and timestamp instead of drawn from a running stream, so
  repeated, overlapping and time-shifted queries agree at shared timestamps.
  Timestamps are keyed at millisecond resolution; windows whose timestamps are not
  convertible to epoch seconds keep per-window determinism only.
- The shipped control-assistant simulation data now produces organic BPM and
  corrector-readback signals instead of flat lines, and corrector channels gained
  the symmetric upper current limit their lower limit implied.
- Workspace gallery: the Simple view's result card now shows every artifact type
  the Expert preview does. Markdown, JSON, plain text, PDFs and archiver
  timeseries previously appeared there as a type icon or a raw summary dump —
  which covered channel-finder results and the agent's own written answers, since
  those are saved as markdown or JSON. Both views now render through one shared
  renderer, so no type can display in one view and not the other.

### Added

- Web terminal: the panel rail can now sit along the top (`web.rail_position: top` or the panel "+" menu).
- Web terminal: new `retro` theme family restoring the pre-redesign look (`web.theme: retro`) — the navy/teal palette, the CRT treatment, and the horizontal tab bar. Setting `web.rail_position` explicitly still pins the rail in every theme.
- A `demo-ui` skill runs short scripted demonstrations of the agent driving the web workspace: a panel tour, an artifact hand-off, and a layout switch, individually or back to back. It reads the live panel inventory rather than assuming a fixed tab set, and restores the starting layout when it finishes.
- The web terminal's Simple mode now starts as a clean chat-first experience: with an empty agent workspace the page shows only the chat, and the WORKSPACE panel appears the moment the agent shares its first artifact (`show_panel`); a workspace that already holds artifacts opens as before. The OSPREY agent is told at session start which surface it serves — Simple sessions are instructed to bring up the WORKSPACE panel whenever they produce something the operator should see.
- A `channel-finder-standalone` preset packages OSPREY's natural-language channel/PV address finder — the channel-finder pipeline plus its interactive CHANNELS web panel — as a standalone, read-only deployment with no control-system stack, archiver, logbook, or Python executor. It ships a bundled demo hierarchical database so it runs out of the box; `channel_finder_mode` selects the `in_context`, `hierarchical`, or `middle_layer` pipeline.
- The control-assistant preset now ships the KNOWLEDGE panel, a browser for the project's facility knowledge bundle. Existing projects gain the tab by adding `okf` to `web_panels` and rebuilding.
- Agent actions are now highlighted live in the web terminal: the plan panel follows the OSPREY agent's drafts (with a banner instead of a switch when you have unsaved edits), panels the agent touches glow and carry an attention badge on the panel rail until you open them, and backend actions — channel writes, run launches — appear briefly in the status-bar activity strip.
- Explicit `--set provider=` / `--set model=` / `--set channel_finder_mode=` build overrides now propagate to the persona projects that multi-user deploys auto-render: the manifest records which of these keys were explicitly passed, and `osprey deploy up` forwards them to each persona's `osprey build` — so one override at build time retints the whole stack. Preset defaults are never forwarded, keeping per-persona provider customization intact.
- Broad unit-test coverage for previously untested modules across services (migration engine, channel-finder data layer and tools, python-executor sandbox plumbing), interfaces (lattice-dashboard physics workers, web-terminal file/chat/scaffold routes incl. the path-traversal guard), CLI menus, MCP servers, registry loader/export, deployment, template hooks, and utilities.
- A bluesky scan plan can now be hidden from the agent without turning off the whole scan server. Set `bluesky.excluded_plans` on the profile of the project that deploys the bridge; the deploy render carries it into the bridge as the `BLUESKY_EXCLUDED_PLANS` environment variable. An excluded plan is both absent from the agent's plan list and non-runnable — it cannot be staged or launched by name. The bare config key is a local/development convenience; the environment variable is the production channel.

- `osprey deploy up` and `osprey deploy status` now warn when the project's render is stale — i.e. it was rendered by a different osprey version, or the preset's content has changed since the render (a content hash of the resolved preset is stamped into `.osprey-manifest.json` at build time). The warning names the exact `osprey build ... --force` command to re-render; it never blocks a deploy, and legacy projects without the stamp are unaffected.
- Every `osprey deploy up` now ends with a service-endpoint summary (published host ports from the rendered compose files, plus the web-terminal landing URL — or an explicit "web terminal (not configured in this project)" line when the config declares no web tier).

### Changed

- Logging is now configured explicitly and writes to stderr. Importing Osprey no longer installs a log handler as a side effect — entry points call `osprey.configure_logging()` once at startup, and code that embeds Osprey as a library (notebooks, scripts, preset repos) should do the same to see log output. Log lines that previously appeared on stdout now appear on stderr, so stdout carries only program output: `--json` payloads stay machine-readable and MCP stdio traffic stays clean. `configure_logging()` adds to whatever logging a host application has already set up and never removes handlers it did not install.
- The ARIEL panel no longer shows the logbook Search tab when embedded in the web terminal — search there goes through the agent, so the embedded panel offers Browse, New Entry, and Status and opens on Browse. Standalone ARIEL keeps Search as the default view.
- `osprey build` now records a project's dependencies in a generated `pyproject.toml` instead of `requirements.txt`. This makes `uv run osprey web` (and any other command) resolve the project's own `.venv` rather than walking up to an ancestor project's environment, and makes `uv sync` rebuild the environment instead of pruning it empty. Existing projects can delete their now-unused `requirements.txt` on the next `osprey build --force`.
- `osprey deploy up` now runs the web-terminal preflight (persona auto-render and the fail-closed `.env.production` credential gate) *before* building any image, so a deploy doomed to abort on a missing provider secret says so in seconds instead of after the full image build. When the missing variable is exported in the caller's shell but absent from `.env`, the error now says so and names the exact copy-in command (`.env` remains the only secret source the generator reads).
- The `osprey-build-interview` skill now asks the installed framework what it offers instead of carrying its own catalog: presets, build artifacts, providers, and config keys are all read from the live installation at interview time, so a newly shipped capability is offered without anyone editing the skill. It generates the profile with `osprey build --emit-profile` rather than a hand-written YAML template, and builds that profile itself before handing it over — what you receive is known to build. The interview now adapts its questions to the person rather than following a fixed script, and takes about five minutes. Legacy-project migration, the feedback prompts, and the web-panel design step were removed; panel authoring belongs to the `creating-an-osprey-panel` skill.
- New `osprey.build` package holds the build-time kernel shared across layers (Claude Code model/provider resolution, telemetry env block, channel-finder tier defaults, manifest primitives); agent-runtime helpers (clean child-env, SDK system-prompt, artifact-path resolution, Claude Code project-path encoding) moved to `osprey.agent_runner`. This removes the `services`/`mcp_server` → `cli`/`interfaces` layering inversions; internal import paths changed with no compatibility shims.
- Removed the legacy facility-config `gitlab:` block: a config that still carries it now fails closed with a `ConfigurationError` naming the `ci: {provider: "gitlab", ...}` replacement, instead of being silently aliased.
- Bluesky panels app moved from services to interfaces (import path `osprey.interfaces.bluesky_panels`).
- python-executor: removed the deprecated `epics_writes_enabled` field; `control_system_writes_enabled` is now the single write-gating flag.
- The seven LiteLLM-thin provider adapters (anthropic, als-apg, amsc-i2, cborg, google, openai, stanford) now share a single data-driven delegating base; behavior is unchanged (Stanford keeps its base-URL fallback).
- The three channel-finder MCP servers now share one bootstrap module (config load, path resolution, `python -m` entry point, startup sequence); behavior and entry points are unchanged.
- `osprey build --force` now re-renders an existing project *in place* instead of deleting the directory: `.env` (existing values win over freshly detected ones, and keys only it carries are kept), `_agent_data/`, and the project's `.git` are preserved; everything framework-rendered, including `data/`, is rebuilt. A profile-provided `env.file` is likewise merged into an existing `.env` rather than overwriting it.

### Fixed

- `osprey ariel purge` now clears the text-embedding migration record along with the dropped embedding tables, so a subsequent `osprey ariel migrate` actually recreates them instead of silently no-opping.
- Containerized Python execution no longer misclassifies an infrastructure failure during result collection as a code error: pre-classified executor errors keep their retry category, so an infrastructure fault re-executes the same code instead of triggering code regeneration.
- The Stanford provider's health-check model id had a typo (`gpt-4.omini` → `gpt-4o-mini`), also fixed in its available-models list.
- The AskSage provider now falls back to its static default model list when a `/models` fetch fails or credentials are missing, instead of returning a malformed value that could reach a UI caller. The fetched list is also cached across adapter instances, so an AskSage completion no longer pays a repeat `/models` round-trip on every request.
- Every companion web panel now gets its own per-user port family in multi-user deployments. The family set is derived from the web-server registry — previously it was a hand-maintained list that missed the channel-finder and OKF panels, so a second user's container collided with the first on the panel's fixed port (crash-looping the container once the `osprey web` preflight landed). Families omitted from config fall back to registry defaults (`channel_finder_base_port` 9591, `okf_base_port` 9691), so existing configs deploy unchanged.
- Bluesky PLAN/RESULTS/HEALTH panels now resolve their API endpoints correctly under the multi-user `/u/<user>/` mount: the shared `panelApiPrefix()` helper accepts an outer proxy prefix, the health panel no longer relies on the proxy's content rewrite (which double-prefixes once the runtime prefix is correct — this also fixes the proxied single-user health panel), and a guard test keeps panel bundles free of literals colliding with the proxy rewrite list.
- Panel tabs without a configured health endpoint (e.g. PLAN and RESULTS) now show a green LED instead of a permanently red one — the tab-state painter runs for panels that skip health polling.
- The multi-user landing page is served only at `/`; any other path outside a `/u/<user>/` mount now returns 404 instead of silently answering with landing-page HTML.
- `osprey deploy up` hot-reloads nginx after reconciling the web-terminal stack, so re-rendered `nginx.conf` routing changes take effect without a manual container restart.

- `osprey deploy up` is now idempotent from any prior state: it first removes the project's own stale non-running containers (a container left in `created` state by an aborted deploy holds its published host ports on Docker Desktop, blocking the next `up` with "address already in use"), and the plain services path reconciles away containers of services removed from the config. Running containers, volumes, and sibling deployments on the same host are untouched.
- `osprey deploy rebuild` on a web-terminals project now brings the web-terminal stack (nginx, per-user containers) back up after the clean; previously it restarted only the backend services. Per-user volumes survive a rebuild.
- Local-mode `.env.production` generation now includes the auth secret for every `claude_code.provider` in play — the deploy config's own and each referenced persona project's. A persona whose secret is missing from `.env` aborts the deploy naming the exact variable, and an existing `.env.production` that contains none of the configured LLM credentials draws a warning; previously the file could silently omit the credential entirely, producing healthy-looking web terminals that fail authentication on their first prompt.
- `osprey deploy up` probes the web-terminal landing page from the host after bringing the stack up and warns when it is unreachable. On Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows), `network_mode: host` binds inside the Docker VM unless the opt-in host-networking setting is enabled — previously this state was reported as a fully successful deploy; the warning now names that setting.

### Added

- **Shared ALS-U Accumulator Ring lattice** — the real ALS-U AR design (2.0 GeV, 182.12 m, harmonic 304) ported to pyAT as a plain-venv-importable `osprey.simulation.lattice` module (`build_ring()`), alongside a declarative `FacilitySpec` (`osprey.simulation.facility_spec`) that is the single source of truth for device families, per-family counts, and the `AR:{sup}:{fam}:{id}` naming scheme. A canonical `.mat` build artifact ships with the package; regenerate it with `python -m osprey.simulation.lattice.build`.
- `channel_limits` gains a `name_contains` parameter for literal substring search, so channel names containing regex metacharacters (`[]`, `()`, `.`, `^`) can be looked up without manual escaping. The existing regex `pattern` behavior is unchanged; the two are mutually exclusive.
- The `control-assistant` preset now ships the multi-user web-terminal stack built in: `osprey deploy up` stands up nginx (landing page at `:9080`) and per-user terminals for a two-user roster mapped to two new persona presets — `control-assistant-readonly` (the default) and `control-assistant-readwrite` (write-capable through the ordinary safety chain). Single-user onboarding is unchanged (`osprey web` never reads the block); set `modules.web_terminals.enabled: false` in the rendered config to deploy backend services without the web tier.
- **Canonical logbook entry URLs from ARIEL** — ARIEL read tools (search, browse, entry lookup, SQL query, publish) now emit an `entry_url` for facility logbook entries, rendered from a configurable `ariel.entry_url_template`, so the agent links entries verbatim instead of fabricating a plausible-but-dead URL. Off by default: deployments with no template configured, and ARIEL-native entries not yet in the facility logbook, emit no URL. The read path is fail-safe — a malformed template degrades to no URL rather than crashing.
- **Health checks on the agent surface** — an opt-in `health` MCP server (`claude_code.servers.health.enabled: true`) lets the OSPREY agent read the health suite through two tiered tools: `health_check` (auto-approved, served from a per-session cache) and `health_check_full` (approval-gated, always runs the `on_demand` checks fresh). The `mcp_servers` category is now auto-derived from the wired `claude_code.servers` blocks — one reachability check per server, with expected tools taken from each server's declared permissions — so no `health.categories.mcp_servers` need be hand-authored (`health.auto.mcp.{enabled,url_key}` tunes it). See the "Configure Health Checks" how-to.
- **Built-in service health tiles and an archiver data probe** — `osprey health` (and the SYSTEM dashboard) gains two presence-gated categories that appear only when the corresponding service is configured: `ariel` (interface reachability, logbook entry count, last ingestion, registered search/enhancement modules) and `channel_finder` (active pipeline, channel-database presence and age, middle-layer channel count). A new `archiver_freshness` probe type verifies the archiver is actually accumulating data — the newest archived sample of a canary channel must be younger than `max_age_s`. The health-checks how-to gains a control-system smoke-test recipe (canary `channel_read` + `archiver_freshness`).
- **Multi-user web terminals behind a single origin** — the multi-user web-terminal stack now binds every per-user service to loopback and routes all browser traffic through one nginx origin at `/u/<user>/`, instead of exposing each per-user app on its own host port; the Web Terminal SPA serves identically under that per-user prefix. Optional, off-by-default auth and TLS seams are wired into the deploy config (`modules.web_terminals.auth` / `.tls`): they render the corresponding nginx blocks with no frontend change and fail closed (an enabled `auth.method` with no backend returns 403) — so this remains a trust-the-network deployment until a real auth backend and TLS certificates are configured. Logging out now ends the warm terminal session and returns to the landing page.
- **Panel presets ("Layouts") for the Web Terminal** — a deployer can declare named sets of panels under a new `web.presets` block in `config.yml`, and an operator applies one in a single click from a "Layouts" section at the top of the panel "+" menu. Applying a preset shows exactly its panels and closes the rest. It reuses the existing panel-visibility path (no new endpoints or state), and when no presets are configured the "+" menu looks exactly as before. See the "Panels" how-to.
- **Add and remove Web Terminal panels from the browser** — the panel tab strip now has a browser-style "+" button to show a hidden panel, and each tab has a hover "×" to close it. When `web.allow_runtime_panels` is enabled, the "+" menu also offers a "new panel from URL" field (subject to the same URL validation and allowlist as agent-driven registration). The human and the agent share one panel set, so a panel added or removed either way updates for everyone.
- **Agent telemetry over OpenTelemetry (opt-in)** — a `claude_code.telemetry` block in `config.yml` (off by default) makes the OSPREY agent emit its operational logs and metrics over OTLP to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend, from every launch path (CLI chat, Web Terminal, dispatch worker, SDK). An optional local **OpenObserve** backend ships as an opt-in `osprey deploy` add-on (add `openobserve` to `deployed_services`) — a single public container that ingests OTLP and serves a browser UI, with ingest auth bootstrapped from the same `.env` credentials it uses for its admin login. Full-content capture (prompts, responses, tool calls, raw provider bodies) defaults on for the local air-gapped store and is per-key configurable. See the "Monitor Your OSPREY Agent" how-to.
- **Per-surface dispatch differentiation** — a trigger's `action.surface_prompt` appends a static awareness fragment to the dispatched agent's system prompt, and an optional per-surface tool scope narrows (never widens) the trigger's `allowed_tools`. Both are no-ops when unset, so existing triggers behave exactly as before.
- `pyat-specialist` subagent: specialist agent scoped to lattice/optics computation over the simulated ALS-U AR ring, writing and executing pyAT code via the python execution service; enabled by default in `control_assistant`; delegates lattice/optics computation out of the main agent's context and returns provenance-carrying answers (`lattice_analysis` artifacts, labeled as simulation-derived).
- Every OSPREY browser interface — Web Terminal, Artifacts, ARIEL, Channel Finder, the Lattice dashboard, the event dispatch dashboard, the KNOWLEDGE (facility-knowledge) panel, and the session activity/safety pages — now themes itself from one shared design-token system with dark, light, and `auto` (follows your OS color-scheme preference) modes. See the "Theming" how-to for adding a new theme or wiring a new interface into it.
- **Design token scales** — type, font weight, line-height, spacing, radius, z-index, and duration are now generated CSS variables (`--text-*`, `--weight-*`, `--leading-*`, `--space-*`, `--radius-*`, `--z-*`, `--duration-*`) alongside the existing color and font tokens, with a hygiene check enforcing zero bare scale literals in migrated interfaces. The Web Terminal and design-system CSS are fully migrated onto them. A live, runtime-enumerated token reference page is served at `/design-system/reference.html` in every interface; see `src/osprey/interfaces/design_system/DESIGN.md` for the designer-facing contract.
- Themes are now grouped into **families** — a family is a `{light, dark}` pair. Alongside the existing `osprey` family, a new WCAG-AAA `high-contrast` family ships out of the box. The theme switcher now picks a family, and toggling light/dark stays within the active family. A new `web.theme` key under `config.yml`'s `web:` section sets the default family (or a specific theme) the Web Terminal server-renders on first paint, independent of the CLI's own `cli.theme`. See the "Theming" how-to for authoring a new theme or family.
- A new **`apex`** theme family — a warm, gold-forward skin with softer slate dark surfaces and an Instrument Serif / IBM Plex Sans typographic pairing — ships alongside `osprey` and `high-contrast`, selectable from the theme switcher. The product default theme is now pinned explicitly via `$extensions.default`, so adding a theme whose filename sorts ahead of the default can no longer change which theme the interfaces boot into.
- **Web Terminal UI modes** — a new `web.ui_mode` key under `config.yml`'s `web:` section chooses the interface density the terminal server-renders on first paint: `expert` (default) shows the full operator shell; `simple` shows a pared-down shell for lighter-weight use. An operator can override per session with a `?mode=expert|simple` URL parameter or the in-app header toggle (remembered across reloads); an unknown value falls back to `expert`. Every panel follows the mode live — Workspace, ARIEL, Channels, Lattice, Knowledge, the Events dashboard, and the Bluesky scan panels each ship a simple variant (one primary surface, plain-language cards, expert-only chrome hidden) alongside their unchanged expert view.
- **Simple-mode operator chat** — in Simple UI mode the Web Terminal's terminal card becomes a minimal chat: you type a prompt and the OSPREY agent's reply streams back, with a one-line activity indicator while it works. Conversations are multi-turn for the life of the page (a reload starts a fresh one; chat history is not persisted); Expert mode keeps the full interactive terminal. Three `web` keys bound the chat pool — `chat_turn_timeout_s` (600), `chat_idle_timeout_s` (1800), and `chat_max_sessions` (5). See the "Operate" how-to.
- **Rearrangeable Web Terminal workspace** — in Expert mode the fixed panel/terminal split is now a docking workspace of tiles, one panel per tile. The icon rail is the workspace's tab system: clicking a panel switches the focused tile to it (the replaced panel dims on the rail, one click from coming back), clicking a panel that is already open jumps to its tile, and the "+" menu opens a panel in a new tile beside the active one. Drag any tile (or the terminal card) into side-by-side splits; drops that would stack panels as tabs inside one tile are rejected. Your arrangement is saved per project and restored on reload, and "Reset layout" returns to the default. Simple mode stays a fixed, locked layout with a single panel tile, and agent-driven panel changes still apply in either mode.
- **Panel authoring standard** — a panel is a directory bundling a themed, token-only HTML entry point plus a `manifest.json`. Author one from the reference panel, then check it against the panel validator (`assert_valid_panel`), which verifies the manifest schema, the pre-paint theme boot and token stylesheet, and that no raw hex colors bypass the design tokens. The new `creating-an-osprey-panel` skill (`osprey skills install creating-an-osprey-panel`) is the guided path, and the "Panels" how-to documents the contract.
- **Local panel discovery** — drop a compliant panel bundle under `<project>/panels/` and, with `web.allow_runtime_panels: true` (off by default), the Web Terminal discovers it on startup and serves it same-origin at `/panel-static/<id>/`. Discovery is fail-closed: a malformed or non-compliant bundle is skipped and logged, never served, and never affects the other panels. See the "Panels" how-to. Note: the Web Terminal has no application-level authentication yet — enabling this trusts the panels made available to the terminal; first-class auth is a tracked follow-up.
- Dev/CI-only front-end JavaScript toolchain — `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) and `npm run test:js` (Vitest), enforced by a CI job; JS files opt into type-checking with a `// @ts-check` comment. Not needed to install or run OSPREY.
- Dev/CI-only Python-Playwright browser-test foundation under `tests/interfaces/` — a shared server/browser conftest plus an `assert_page_loads_clean` helper and a per-interface "loads clean in a real browser" smoke over all six web interfaces (`-m browser`), wired into the existing theming CI job. Skips cleanly when Chromium is absent; not needed to install or run OSPREY.
- Dev-only contact-sheet renderer (`python -m docs.screenshots.contact_sheet --out DIR`) — boots the real Web Terminal in every theme × UI-mode variant against a pre-seeded demo workspace (no live agent, provider, or hardware), then every supported panel standalone in the same 2×2 matrix, and composes one self-contained `contact-sheet.html` for reviewing a redesign at a glance; `--accents` renders each hub variant under both accent candidates for an A/B decision. A capture/review tool only — nothing it produces is committed or CI-gated. See the contributing guide.
- **Native Phoebus control panels** — an optional `phoebus` MCP server lets the agent perceive a running [Phoebus](https://control-system-studio.readthedocs.io/) panel's widget tree, snapshot widgets, and drive controls (driving is approval-gated, like any hardware write). Off by default; enable with `claude_code.servers.phoebus.enabled: true` and configure the bridge and named panels via the `phoebus.*` config keys (see the build-deploy config schema). The Phoebus agent bridge itself is a facility build, not part of OSPREY.
- **KNOWLEDGE web panel** — a read-only browser panel over a facility-knowledge (OKF) bundle: concept tree, markdown reader, substring search, and a bundle-health summary, served as the `KNOWLEDGE` tab in the Web Terminal (the `okf` builtin panel). Reads the bundle configured at `facility_knowledge.bundle_path`.
- **Multi-turn agent sessions** — `agent_session(...)` holds one agent conversation open across several turns so a caller can decide each message from the agent's previous reply, with per-turn and cumulative cost tracking and a session-wide budget; `run_turns(...)` is a convenience for a fixed prompt sequence. The single-turn `osprey query` path (`run_query`) is unchanged and now shares the same provider-routing and stream-parsing code.
- `osprey web` runs a fast, offline pre-flight check before binding and aborts with a consolidated error if a companion panel port is already in use, a proxy provider's auth secret is missing from the environment or `.env`, or `config.yml`/`.claude/settings.json` fails to parse — catching launch-time misconfiguration up front instead of as a silent wrong-state or a runtime error. Pass `--skip-preflight` to bypass.
- **Configurable health checks** — a `health:` block in `config.yml` lets a facility extend `osprey health` beyond the built-in checks. Declare probe-based checks — HTTP endpoints, MCP servers, deployed containers, control-system channel reads, and model-provider canaries — grouped into named categories with per-check timeouts and `requires:` dependencies, register facility health plugins in code, and tune the suite's timeouts. Checks are classed `poll` (cheap, run by default) or `on_demand` (costly, run only with `--full`). See the "Configure Health Checks" how-to.
- **`SYSTEM` health dashboard panel** — panel-shipping Web Terminal builds gain a read-only `SYSTEM` tab showing the health suite's poll-class results (status ring, per-category cards, per-check LEDs) in the browser, refreshed on the `interval_s` cadence. The dashboard never runs `on_demand` checks — those appear as informational cards with a copyable `osprey health --full --category <name>` hint. Hosting is configured under `health.web.{host,port,auto_launch}` and the heading under `health.title`; enable the tab by adding `system-health` to a build's `web_panels`. The tab's LED indicates sidecar liveness (up/down), not aggregate check status. Config and `.env` edits are picked up on the next refresh; a `control_system` change after the first channel read is surfaced as a restart notice rather than applied live. See the "Configure Health Checks" how-to.
- **Multi-user web terminals from a declarative `users[]`** — the multi-user web-terminal stack (per-user containers, an auto-populated grouped landing page, and nginx routing) is now generated deterministically from a single `users[]` list in `facility-config.yml` by `osprey scaffold web-terminals render`, with `osprey scaffold web-terminals lint` as a consistency and port-overlap gate for CI. This generator is the sole path that produces those artifacts, so editing `users[]` and re-rendering keeps the compose overlay, routing, and landing page in sync with no hand-editing. Each per-user terminal surfaces its user in the header and, when a landing origin is configured, offers a logout control that returns to the landing page and reconnects the user's still-warm session on return (single-user `osprey web` is unchanged — the control is absent). A per-user context overlay — `CLAUDE.md` (from a shared base plus a per-user `extra.md`) and a project-scope `skills/` tree — is seeded into each user's volume at deploy time, tracked so deploy never clobbers skills a user installed themselves. Not authenticated and not TLS-terminated: intended for perimeter-trusted networks only, with first-class auth, TLS, and single-origin routing as tracked follow-ups.
- **Web-terminal personas** — `modules.web_terminals.personas.<name>` lets a facility give different web-terminal users their own container image and their own rendered OSPREY project (and, since permissions live in that project's own `config.yml`, their own real per-tool permissions for free); `users[]` entries gain an optional `persona:` key, with `default_persona` as the fallback. Omitting `personas:` entirely is unchanged, zero-migration behavior.
- **Registry-optional web-terminal deploys** — `modules.web_terminals.image_source: local` builds each referenced persona's image directly from a locally rendered project directory instead of pulling from a registry, for facilities without a CI/registry pipeline.
- `modules.web_terminals.mcp.topology` schema key for the framework MCP server tier; `per_container_stdio` (today's behavior) is the only accepted value, and `shared_http` is rejected fail-closed (lint error and render error) pending future wiring.
- **Two-persona multi-user demo** — a new `multi-user-demo` preset family ships the multi-user web-terminal stack out of the box: a read-only and a read-write persona (`multi-user-demo-readonly` / `multi-user-demo-readwrite`) differing on exactly one config key, `control_system.writes_enabled`, plus an alice/bob roster. The demo is deliberately scan-free (no Bluesky bridge, no Virtual Accelerator) so it demonstrates multi-user provisioning and the write boundary, nothing else; the full scan stack stays with `control-assistant`. `osprey deploy up` (local mode) auto-renders any referenced persona project that hasn't been built yet, so one `osprey build` + `osprey deploy up` brings up the whole stack with no per-persona builds. A new multi-user demo walkthrough documents the flow.
- `exclude:` build-profile key — a profile that `extends:` another can subtract inherited entries from the string-list fields (`skills`, `rules`, `hooks`, `agents`, `output_styles`, `web_panels`, `dependencies`). A deeper extends layer re-adding an entry wins; override files and `--set` merge before exclusion and cannot re-add. Documented in the build-profiles how-to.
- `deploy_services: false` build-profile key marks an **attached project** — one that connects to services deployed by another OSPREY project on the same host instead of scaffolding its own (service sections still parse and validate, but the built project gets `deployed_services: []` and no `services/` tree; `osprey deploy up` in it is a clean no-op). The persona presets (`multi-user-demo-readonly`/`-readwrite`) build attached, consuming the demo stack's shared services instead of carrying deployable copies whose host ports collide with it.
- `osprey deploy up` now runs a host-port preflight before touching any container: every port the deploy would publish is probed, and one already held by another stack or process aborts the deploy naming the holder and the config key to change — instead of failing mid-`up` with a bare `address already in use`. Ports held by the project's own containers are exempt, so redeploys are unaffected.
- Web-terminals lint: a persona `project_path` that doesn't exist yet but is auto-renderable is now an info instead of an error; new errors catch a persona `project` not matching `basename(project_path)` and an empty `facility.prefix` on user-serving configs (both previously surfaced only as `deploy up` failures).
- The grouped landing page shows each user's persona as a badge on their card, and a pixel-diff visual test now covers the multi-user landing.
- `facility-config.yml`'s `gitlab:` block is renamed to a provider-tagged `ci: {provider: "gitlab", ...}` block, mirroring the `llm.provider` pattern; the old `gitlab:` shape still works via a one-time deprecation warning, and `registry.token_env_var` can now be set independently of the CI token instead of always riding the same PAT.
- The multi-user web-terminal compose overlay now declares each container's published port via `OSPREY_TERMINAL_WEB_PORT`, authoritative over `--port`/config, mirroring the existing `OSPREY_TERMINAL_BIND_HOST` declaration.
- `osprey deploy decommission`/`prune`/`nuke` now discover a deployment's containers, volumes, and (for local-mode personas) images by compose-project label instead of name-prefix matching, so two OSPREY deployments on the same host no longer risk cross-matching each other's resources.
- `osprey deploy up` now runs `scripts/verify.sh` automatically after bringing the web-terminal stack up (streamed, advisory — its exit code doesn't fail the deploy); a missing script is a silent skip.
- `modules.shared_disk`'s host path is now checked before compose runs, so a missing mount path aborts the deploy with an actionable error instead of failing inside a container later.

- `CITATION.cff`, enabling GitHub's "Cite this repository" button.
- `SECURITY.md` documenting private vulnerability reporting, plus a bug-report issue template.
- `NOTICE`, carrying the Berkeley Lab endorsement clause, Enhancements grant, and U.S. Government rights notice that previously sat inside `LICENSE.txt`. The licensing terms are unchanged; `LICENSE.txt` is now the unmodified BSD 3-Clause text, so automated tooling identifies the license correctly.
- The channel-finder benchmark suite gains near-miss *discrimination* queries — pairs that separate the correct channel from a plausible-but-wrong neighbour — and a stratified end-to-end evaluation slice. Development/CI only; not needed to install or run OSPREY.

### Changed

- `osprey deploy --dev` now fails with a clear error when the local osprey wheel
  cannot be built, instead of warning and deploying the pinned PyPI release.
  Previously a missing `build` package (or a broken local checkout) produced one
  warning among many info lines and an exit code of 0, so the containers came up
  running released osprey and the deployment silently tested something other than
  the local code. The preconditions — editable install, source checkout, `build`
  package — are now checked before any deploy work begins, and `build` moved from
  the `dev` extra to a base dependency so an editable install always has it.
- `osprey build` now prints a provider-credentials summary that reports the API
  keys it *found*, not just the ones it didn't. It leads with the provider the
  project was built for, names where that key came from (project `.env`, the
  build directory's `.env`, or the shell), and warns if the selected provider's
  key is missing. Previously the build logged one line per *unresolved*
  placeholder — twice — so a successful key was silent, and a missing key for
  the selected provider looked identical to the irrelevant misses for providers
  the project never uses. The per-placeholder resolver line moved to `DEBUG`.
- Scaffolded `.env` / `.env.example` files derive their provider API-key list
  from the provider registry instead of a hand-maintained list (which had
  drifted: `ALS_APG_API_KEY` was missing, a stale Langfuse block remained, and
  a detected `ARGO_API_KEY` value was discarded in favor of a `$${USER}`
  placeholder).
- Shipped preset configs now document `deployment.bind_address` and point the
  Virtual Accelerator instructions at `osprey deploy up` instead of a
  repo-internal container path.

- The model-benchmark matrix now scores two lanes separately: `agentic_benchmark`
  marks genuine model-capability e2e tests (the headline pass rate) and
  `harness_benchmark` marks model-independent safety/plumbing assertions, so
  harness passes no longer pad a model's capability score. Every in-scope e2e
  test must declare its lane (gated per matrix cell and in CI); 19 non-LLM e2e
  files moved to the matrix exclusion list. The `e2e_benchmark` marker was
  renamed to `channel_finder_benchmark` to say what it actually covers.

- The ARIEL panel no longer shows the logbook Search tab when embedded in the web terminal — search there goes through the agent, so the embedded panel offers Browse, New Entry, and Status and opens on Browse. Standalone ARIEL keeps Search as the default view.
- `osprey build` now records a project's dependencies in a generated `pyproject.toml` instead of `requirements.txt`. This makes `uv run osprey web` (and any other command) resolve the project's own `.venv` rather than walking up to an ancestor project's environment, and makes `uv sync` rebuild the environment instead of pruning it empty. Existing projects can delete their now-unused `requirements.txt` on the next `osprey build --force`.
- `osprey deploy up` now runs the web-terminal preflight (persona auto-render and the fail-closed `.env.production` credential gate) *before* building any image, so a deploy doomed to abort on a missing provider secret says so in seconds instead of after the full image build. When the missing variable is exported in the caller's shell but absent from `.env`, the error now says so and names the exact copy-in command (`.env` remains the only secret source the generator reads).
- The `osprey-build-interview` skill now asks the installed framework what it offers instead of carrying its own catalog: presets, build artifacts, providers, and config keys are all read from the live installation at interview time, so a newly shipped capability is offered without anyone editing the skill. It generates the profile with `osprey build --emit-profile` rather than a hand-written YAML template, and builds that profile itself before handing it over — what you receive is known to build. The interview now adapts its questions to the person rather than following a fixed script, and takes about five minutes. Legacy-project migration, the feedback prompts, and the web-panel design step were removed; panel authoring belongs to the `creating-an-osprey-panel` skill.
- New `osprey.build` package holds the build-time kernel shared across layers (Claude Code model/provider resolution, telemetry env block, channel-finder tier defaults, manifest primitives); agent-runtime helpers (clean child-env, SDK system-prompt, artifact-path resolution, Claude Code project-path encoding) moved to `osprey.agent_runner`. This removes the `services`/`mcp_server` → `cli`/`interfaces` layering inversions; internal import paths changed with no compatibility shims.
- Removed the legacy facility-config `gitlab:` block: a config that still carries it now fails closed with a `ConfigurationError` naming the `ci: {provider: "gitlab", ...}` replacement, instead of being silently aliased.
- Bluesky panels app moved from services to interfaces (import path `osprey.interfaces.bluesky_panels`).
- python-executor: removed the deprecated `epics_writes_enabled` field; `control_system_writes_enabled` is now the single write-gating flag.
- The seven LiteLLM-thin provider adapters (anthropic, als-apg, amsc-i2, cborg, google, openai, stanford) now share a single data-driven delegating base; behavior is unchanged (Stanford keeps its base-URL fallback).
- The three channel-finder MCP servers now share one bootstrap module (config load, path resolution, `python -m` entry point, startup sequence); behavior and entry points are unchanged.
- `osprey build --force` now re-renders an existing project *in place* instead of deleting the directory: `.env` (existing values win over freshly detected ones, and keys only it carries are kept), `_agent_data/`, and the project's `.git` are preserved; everything framework-rendered, including `data/`, is rebuilt. A profile-provided `env.file` is likewise merged into an existing `.env` rather than overwriting it.

- **`osprey health` now separates cheap poll-class checks from costly on_demand checks**, run by default and only with `--full` respectively. Three behaviors change as a result:
  - Bare `osprey health` no longer performs live model-chat completions — the `model_chat` category is now `on_demand` and runs only under `--full`.
  - Pinned-CLI verification (the `npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code@<pin>` download) moved to the `on_demand` `claude_cli_pinned` category and likewise requires `--full`; a bare run keeps only the cheap `claude --version` availability check.
  - A host with no container runtime installed now reports container checks as `skip` (exit 0) instead of `warning` (exit 1) — an absent runtime is no longer graded as a problem.
- **Bluesky scan tool surface renamed to a draft-first vocabulary.** The agent's plan-draft and run tools were renamed — `get_plan_draft`/`set_plan_draft`/`clear_plan_draft` → `get_draft`/`set_draft`/`clear_draft`, `run_status` → `get_run`, `read_run_data` → `get_run_data` — and `launch_run` now takes a required `draft_revision` (its `run_id` argument is gone); `create_run_intent` is removed, since the agent now stages one complete draft and launches that pinned revision. The scan arming token was renamed with no fallback to the old names: `BLUESKY_PROMOTE_TOKEN` → `BLUESKY_LAUNCH_TOKEN`, the `X-Promote-Token` header → `X-Launch-Token`, and the `bluesky.promote_token` config key → `bluesky.launch_token`. **Existing deployments must re-render and redeploy after upgrading** — the renamed tools appear in rendered `.claude/settings.json` allowlists, and the old token names are no longer honored.
- The shipped agent is now **instructed to answer verify-first** — to lead with real, tool-sourced data (naming the source) and flag anything not tool-backed plainly and up front, rather than a confident pretrained lead trailed by an optional "…I can verify if you want." Substantive multi-tool answers close with an explicit provenance summary (sources + a confidence/scope note); trivial reads stay terse. The doctrine ships in the `control-operator` output-style and the generated `CLAUDE.md` personas; a deployment that has `osprey scaffold claim`ed either must unclaim + regen (or merge by hand) to adopt it. See the "Facility Rules" how-to.
- `osprey build` now bundles the compose template for every service *declared* under `services:`, not only those in `deployed_services`. An opt-in deploy add-on can therefore be enabled later by adding it to `deployed_services` and running `osprey deploy up`, with no rebuild; a bundled-but-not-deployed template is inert until deployed.
- Every `osprey deploy` compose invocation (`up`, `down`, `restart`, `rebuild`, `clean`) pins `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` to the resolved project name, so each deployment on a shared host owns its own compose project and volume namespace and never adopts, recreates, or removes another deployment's containers or volumes.
- `osprey deploy up --dev` and `osprey deploy rebuild` build images in a dedicated `compose build` step before `up --no-build`, so a build and its container-create never share one invocation — which can fail with `No such image` under Docker's containerd image store. A non-dev `up` still builds a build-only service implicitly.
- The Virtual Accelerator image now builds for the host's native architecture instead of pinning `linux/amd64`. On Apple Silicon it compiles `accelerator-toolbox`/`softioc` from source at build time (a slower first build) and then runs natively with no x86 emulation; on x86_64 it installs the prebuilt wheels as before. A single-arch `amd64` published image on an arm64 host must supply its own `platform` override.
- **The event-dispatch worker now runs the full project image** instead of a lean image that rebuilt its `.claude` artifacts from `config.yml` at startup. Dispatched agents now see the same facility overlays (custom skills, agents, and rules) and `data/` files as the Web Terminal agent, by construction — previously overlays and `data/` were silently absent from dispatched runs. `osprey deploy up` builds the project image (`<project>:local`; `--dev` installs the locally built wheel) and the worker references it via `OSPREY_WORKER_IMAGE`. **Requires rebuilding the dispatch worker image on redeploy.**
- **Dev image rebuilds are now incremental, and locally built service images are project-prefixed.** Each service Dockerfile now splits third-party dependencies (a cached layer) from the locally built OSPREY wheel (a fast layer), so a code-only change rebuilds in seconds and an unchanged deploy rebuilds nothing. Locally built images are now named per project — `<project>-dispatch:local`, `<project>-va:local`, `<project>-bluesky-bridge:local`, `<project>-bluesky-panels:local` — so multiple OSPREY projects on one host no longer overwrite or delete each other's images; every one carries a `com.osprey.project` label, and `osprey deploy clean` now targets the correct compose project. The old host-global images can be removed with `docker rmi osprey-dispatch:local osprey-va:local osprey-bluesky-bridge:local osprey-bluesky-panels:local`. **Migration:** an already-rendered project needs `build/` added to its `.dockerignore` — add it by hand to keep any custom Dockerfile edits, or re-render with `osprey build --force` (which overwrites hand edits). A project name that previously ended in `_` or `-` is now normalized without the trailing separator, changing its compose project and image names; run `osprey deploy down` on the old version before upgrading such a deployment.
- Refreshed the architecture diagram shown on the documentation landing page and the Architecture Overview page to match the current system design.
- `claude-agent-sdk` upgraded to 0.2.110 (bundles CLI 2.1.191); `uv.lock` regenerated (#311).
- `fastmcp` floor raised to `>=3.4.4` (brings FastAPI 0.139 / Starlette 1.x); `uv.lock` regenerated. Route-registration checks now read the app's OpenAPI schema rather than `router.routes`, which Starlette 1.0 no longer flattens for included routers.
- Dependency floors raised — `bokeh`, `gspread`, `watchdog`, `questionary`, `pillow`, `openai`, `scipy`, `bluesky`, `sphinx`, `docker`, `duckdb`, `idna`, `nltk`, `ollama`, `testcontainers`, `tiled`, `urllib3`, `uvicorn`; `uv.lock` regenerated to match.
- The Claude Code launch environment now builds its model-tier variables from a single declaration shared by the launch, e2e-override, and scrub paths, so adding a model tier can no longer leave those lists out of sync (#357). The full project-`.env` passthrough into the agent environment — which feeds `.mcp.json` `${VAR}` references such as `EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST` — is now explicit and test-covered, and proxy providers carry their raw API-key variable through the launch path as well.
- README rewritten: corrected the connector claim (EPICS and Mock ship in-tree; other stacks use the connector interface), fixed the `osprey skills install` quickstart command, and removed stale release and conference notices. The PyPI package description now matches the documentation.
- **The Web Terminal and Artifacts interfaces have been visually redesigned.** A flat card idiom replaces the prior CRT/terminal look, over a new neutral-gray canvas with an azure accent, and the horizontal panel tab strip is now a vertical icon rail (its show/close and add-panel affordances move onto the rail). The panel content now sits directly beside the rail that selects it, with the terminal in the right-hand column (the divider still resizes the split), and the header's documentation shortcut is now a `Docs` link in the status bar. Panel behavior and APIs are unchanged.
- The Web Terminal and ARIEL settings drawers now share one accessible `<osprey-drawer>` component (focus trap and restore, `Escape`/backdrop close, screen-reader dialog semantics, inert background); each interface keeps its own look, and the Web Terminal drawer's tabs, resizing, and unsaved-changes guard behave as before.
- The Web Terminal's first-run theme default changed from forced-dark to `auto`; use the in-app theme toggle if you want a fixed theme regardless of OS preference.
- All web interface factories now share one app-setup helper for CORS, middleware, and static mounts; the Lattice dashboard picks up the standardized CORS policy and two request middlewares it was previously missing.
- The ES-module browser interfaces now import shared front-end helpers (`el`, `escapeHtml`, `debounce`) from a single `dom.js` module instead of per-file copies.
- The Artifacts gallery, the Web Terminal's Scaffold gallery, and the Lattice dashboard are now ES modules broken into focused files instead of single monolithic scripts; behavior is unchanged.
- The Lattice dashboard's accent color changed from a cyan-blue hue to OSPREY's canonical teal accent, matching every other interface.
- The event dispatcher dashboard now themes itself from the shared OSPREY design system instead of a hardcoded dark palette, and follows the web-terminal hub's theme when embedded as the EVENTS panel. **Requires a dispatcher container redeploy** to pick up the new `/design-system/*` asset route.
- Every interface's light/dark toggle is now the shared `<osprey-theme-switcher>` custom element (previously per-interface markup); it's consistently hidden when a panel is embedded in the Web Terminal hub (the hub owns theme chrome there) and visible when opened standalone.
- JSON artifacts in the Artifacts gallery now render through a syntax-highlighted, collapsible inline viewer instead of a plain read-only iframe of the raw file.
- Artifacts gallery: timeseries table values now use magnitude-adaptive precision (≤5 significant figures, scientific notation for extremes) and a compact month/day + HH:MM:SS index format.
- The channel-finder tier databases are now generated for all three paradigms (`in_context`, `hierarchical`, `middle_layer`) from a single `FacilitySpec` by one generator, and drift-gate tests fail if a committed database no longer matches that spec. Tier 1 now ships the `in_context` paradigm only, and the valid build tiers are `1` and `3`.
- ARIEL seed and scenario logbooks now name devices by their flat control-system identifiers (for example `QF08`, `CAVITY01`, `VALVE05`), matching the channel namespace, with a naming guard that keeps them from drifting back to the older hierarchical forms.

### Removed

- Retired the Bluesky scan stack's HEALTH panel and the sidecar's `/health/full` rollup. Service status for the whole deployment is shown by the SYSTEM tab; `web_panels: [health]` entries should be removed from project configs.
- Retired the Tuning optimization panel and its companion web server. It is no longer a built-in panel, and `web_panels: [tuning]` entries should be removed from project configs.
- Dropped the unused `basePath` iframe query parameter from the Web Terminal.
- Retired the tier-2 channel databases and their benchmark query set; build profiles can no longer select tier 2.
### Fixed

- `osprey web --project <dir>` launched from outside the project now behaves the
  same as running `osprey web` inside it. Previously the flag only set the
  terminal's working directory, so the project's `.env` was never loaded
  (leaving `${VAR}` placeholders such as a provider `api_key` unexpanded), the
  project's `web_terminal` and `claude_code` settings were replaced by built-in
  defaults, and `_agent_data/` was created next to wherever the command was run.
- ARIEL logbook ingestion no longer skips an otherwise-valid entry when the source
  payload omits its `id`: the ALS and generic adapters now fall back to an empty
  entry id (matching the JLab/ORNL adapters) instead of raising a `KeyError` the
  fetch loop caught and dropped the entry on.
- All artifact stores are now rooted at the shared data root, so artifacts saved
  from session-scoped writers (e.g. resumed web-terminal sessions) stay visible to
  the gallery.
- `artifact_focus`/`artifact_pin` now report gallery failures honestly instead of
  always claiming success.
- `web.app_name` in `config.yml` now actually labels the web terminal header: the
  runtime read the key from a nested section nothing generates, so only the
  `OSPREY_WEB_APP_NAME` env override worked. It now reads top-level `web.app_name`,
  matching `web.theme` and `web.presets` (env override still wins).
- A server-configured `web.theme` family now survives a visitor's first page load:
  the in-browser theme runtime adopted the default family on first visit instead of
  the configured one. Light/dark still follows the OS until the visitor picks a mode.
- How-to documentation refreshed against the current code: provider model IDs,
  deploy/build semantics (`--force` preservation, `--dev` image builds, full
  subcommand list), telemetry now documented as on-by-default, MCP/executor error
  contracts, and the ARIEL web-interface module tables.

- `osprey ariel purge` now clears the text-embedding migration record along with the dropped embedding tables, so a subsequent `osprey ariel migrate` actually recreates them instead of silently no-opping.
- Containerized Python execution no longer misclassifies an infrastructure failure during result collection as a code error: pre-classified executor errors keep their retry category, so an infrastructure fault re-executes the same code instead of triggering code regeneration.
- The Stanford provider's health-check model id had a typo (`gpt-4.omini` → `gpt-4o-mini`), also fixed in its available-models list.
- The AskSage provider now falls back to its static default model list when a `/models` fetch fails or credentials are missing, instead of returning a malformed value that could reach a UI caller. The fetched list is also cached across adapter instances, so an AskSage completion no longer pays a repeat `/models` round-trip on every request.
- Every companion web panel now gets its own per-user port family in multi-user deployments. The family set is derived from the web-server registry — previously it was a hand-maintained list that missed the channel-finder and OKF panels, so a second user's container collided with the first on the panel's fixed port (crash-looping the container once the `osprey web` preflight landed). Families omitted from config fall back to registry defaults (`channel_finder_base_port` 9591, `okf_base_port` 9691), so existing configs deploy unchanged.
- Bluesky PLAN/RESULTS/HEALTH panels now resolve their API endpoints correctly under the multi-user `/u/<user>/` mount: the shared `panelApiPrefix()` helper accepts an outer proxy prefix, the health panel no longer relies on the proxy's content rewrite (which double-prefixes once the runtime prefix is correct — this also fixes the proxied single-user health panel), and a guard test keeps panel bundles free of literals colliding with the proxy rewrite list.
- Panel tabs without a configured health endpoint (e.g. PLAN and RESULTS) now show a green LED instead of a permanently red one — the tab-state painter runs for panels that skip health polling.
- The multi-user landing page is served only at `/`; any other path outside a `/u/<user>/` mount now returns 404 instead of silently answering with landing-page HTML.
- `osprey deploy up` hot-reloads nginx after reconciling the web-terminal stack, so re-rendered `nginx.conf` routing changes take effect without a manual container restart.

- `osprey deploy up` is now idempotent from any prior state: it first removes the project's own stale non-running containers (a container left in `created` state by an aborted deploy holds its published host ports on Docker Desktop, blocking the next `up` with "address already in use"), and the plain services path reconciles away containers of services removed from the config. Running containers, volumes, and sibling deployments on the same host are untouched.
- `osprey deploy rebuild` on a web-terminals project now brings the web-terminal stack (nginx, per-user containers) back up after the clean; previously it restarted only the backend services. Per-user volumes survive a rebuild.
- Local-mode `.env.production` generation now includes the auth secret for every `claude_code.provider` in play — the deploy config's own and each referenced persona project's. A persona whose secret is missing from `.env` aborts the deploy naming the exact variable, and an existing `.env.production` that contains none of the configured LLM credentials draws a warning; previously the file could silently omit the credential entirely, producing healthy-looking web terminals that fail authentication on their first prompt.
- `osprey deploy up` probes the web-terminal landing page from the host after bringing the stack up and warns when it is unreachable. On Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows), `network_mode: host` binds inside the Docker VM unless the opt-in host-networking setting is enabled — previously this state was reported as a fully successful deploy; the warning now names that setting.

- Generated Dockerfiles (project/persona, virtual accelerator, Bluesky bridge, event dispatcher) switch Debian apt mirrors to HTTPS and set bounded apt retries, so image builds survive networks that throttle or drop plain-HTTP bulk transfers.
- Web-terminal seeding now chowns each user's `CLAUDE.md` and skills to the container's actual runtime user (queried per container) instead of a hardcoded `dispatch` user, which the persona images don't define.
- The `control-assistant` preset now ships `docker/web-terminal-context/base.md` and sets `deploy.fqdn`, so `osprey deploy up` completes without hand-added config (both were hard requirements that aborted the deploy).
- Persona auto-rendering (and the interactive deploy menu) now re-enter the CLI via the running interpreter (`python -m osprey`, newly supported) instead of whatever `osprey` is first on `PATH`, which could resolve to a different install with different presets.
- The scaffolded GitLab CI template no longer writes CI/registry/sidecar tokens into `.env.production`, aligning the CI path with the local-mode environment allowlist.
- `resolve_project_name` now normalizes to a valid docker-compose project name (lowercase, invalid characters replaced, valid leading character) at its single source, so `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, labels, image tags, and volume names all agree for mixed-case or spaced project roots.
- Every persona container now mounts its agent data at `/app/<persona project>` — the default persona was previously pinned to a facility-derived path that could diverge from its image's `WORKDIR`.
- Web Terminal logout: the button announces its in-flight state to assistive technology and carries a persona-aware label; a misconfigured landing URL leaves the button usable.
- A Web Terminal panel closed with its "×" no longer reappears on its own. A panel's backend coming back online was treated as a reason to bring the panel to the front, so a hidden panel could surface itself — most visibly when the Workspace panel was unavailable and a closed panel was the only healthy one left. Health checks now only ever affect a panel's enabled state; showing a panel remains something only you or the agent can ask for.
- A stale `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` (or other backend/model selector) in the operator's shell no longer reroutes the agent away from the configured provider — these are now scrubbed before launch (#356).
- `env.example` no longer ships uncommented placeholder proxy values. Copying it to `.env` exported an unparseable `HTTP_PROXY`, which broke Claude Code launches and OSPREY's own HTTP clients.
- A proxy env var that Claude Code cannot parse (e.g. `HTTP_PROXY=http-proxy` left in `.env` or the shell) is now reported with a clear warning before every agent launch — CLI, Web Terminal, and dispatch worker — instead of surfacing only as an opaque startup crash (#352).
- The `InContextBackend` benchmark test (the sole real-LLM test outside `tests/e2e/`) moved into `tests/e2e/`, so the fast lane (`pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e`) stays hermetic even when a provider key is exported — previously it made a live LLM call and failed with an unrelated gateway auth error on a blocked/expired key. A placement guard prevents recurrence for the whole credentialed `requires_*` marker family.
- Web companion servers (Artifacts, ARIEL, Channel Finder, Lattice, KNOWLEDGE) no longer skip their launch when a stale or foreign process briefly answers `/health` on their port during a restart, which previously left the panel unbacked and permanently 502ing. The launcher now decides ownership by whether a live TCP listener holds the port, waits out a shutting-down predecessor, and logs distinctly when it defers to a legitimate external server versus when the port is held by an unresponsive one (#327).
- The session activity page ("Activity" / session log viewer) no longer applies its `?theme=` query parameter directly to the page; an invalid or unexpected value now falls back to the resolved default instead of being written straight into the page's theme attribute.
- Web Terminal's and Artifacts' syntax-highlighting theme stylesheet no longer 404s in the default CDN vendor mode (it was previously served from a hardcoded local vendor path regardless of the configured vendor mode).
- ARIEL now themes itself from the shared OSPREY design system instead of a hardcoded dark palette, and follows the web-terminal hub's theme when embedded; also fixes a phantom `--amber` CSS variable that was never defined (draft banner and image-lightbox link color).
- Anthropic-native providers configured with a `/v1` base URL (e.g. Argo via `api_protocol: anthropic`) no longer resolve to a doubled `…/v1/v1/messages`: the Claude-Code-facing `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is stripped of a trailing `/v1` (Claude Code appends `/v1/messages` itself), while the translation-proxy upstream keeps its `/v1`. All four launch paths (CLI, web terminal, SDK runner, dispatch worker) now start the proxy from the resolved `upstream_base_url` field rather than the stripped env var, so OpenAI-compatible providers still forward to `…/v1/chat/completions` (#312).
- Headless dispatch runs now enforce the trigger's `allowed_tools` as the single authority via a PreToolUse hook: project `settings.json` allow-rules and the approval hook's explicit allows can no longer widen a run's tool surface, and declared subagents (`.claude/agents/*.md`) work with exactly their declared tools — no trigger changes needed.
- `osprey web --project X` launched from another directory now spawns the interactive terminal's OSPREY agent with `cwd = X`, so it reads `X/.mcp.json` and starts the project's MCP servers (the PTY path previously ignored `--project` and inherited the launch directory) (#313).
- Channel Finder's embedded mode no longer hides its whole header: only the logo is hidden now, so the pipeline switcher and navigation stay visible and usable when embedded in the Web Terminal hub (previously the entire header — including those controls — was hidden, with no compensating layout change).
- Toggling the theme (in the Web Terminal hub or any standalone interface) no longer leaves a stale `?theme=` in the URL; reloading after a toggle now falls back to your saved preference (or the OS setting in `auto` mode) instead of being pinned to whatever value was in the URL at toggle time.
- Creating a new artifact from the Web Terminal's Scaffold gallery no longer fails with an HTTP 405 — the create-artifact request now uses `POST` directly instead of being routed through a GET-only fetch helper.
- Artifacts gallery: filter chips no longer accumulate click listeners across live-refresh cycles, and a failed Plotly script load is retried on the next chart render instead of failing for the rest of the page's lifetime.
- Deployed service containers are now named `<project>-<service>` (e.g. `<project>-ariel-postgres`, `<project>-virtual-accelerator`, `<project>-bluesky-bridge`) instead of host-global names, so two OSPREY projects can deploy the same services on one host concurrently without colliding on a container name. In-network service discovery is unaffected (it uses the compose service key, not the container name); the `ariel-postgres` DSN hostname is preserved via a network alias.

### Security

- Provider isolation now holds against a personal `~/.claude/settings.json`. Claude Code loads settings-file `env` blocks on top of the process environment, so a model or base-URL value in an operator's global (or gitignored local) settings would silently override the project's configured provider. The `osprey claude chat` and Web Terminal launch paths now start Claude Code with `--setting-sources project`, matching the SDK launch paths, so only the project's own `.claude/settings.json` applies. Additionally, `osprey claude chat`, the Web Terminal, and the dispatch worker now refuse to launch when enterprise **managed-policy** settings set a provider variable OSPREY manages — the one scope that outranks the project — naming the variable and file rather than starting against an unconfigured backend. **Behavior change for interactive users:** because the user and local settings scopes are no longer loaded when launching the agent, personal `~/.claude/settings.json` customizations (status line, output style, hooks) and persisted "always allow" permission grants in `.claude/settings.local.json` no longer apply inside `osprey claude chat` / the Web Terminal; put project-wide settings in the project's `.claude/settings.json` instead.
- Artifacts gallery: agent-supplied artifact metadata (`category`, `artifact_type`, type-registry labels) is now HTML-escaped at every render sink, the shared `escapeHtml` escapes quotes for attribute contexts, and artifact ids are percent-encoded in URL paths — closing a stored-XSS in the gallery sidebar.

## [2026.6.3] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- The `events` web panel now builds and renders when its URL is derived from a `dispatch` block. Two regressions from the v2026.6.2 move of `events` out of `BUILTIN_PANELS` are addressed: (1) the build-profile validator now accepts a dispatch-backed `events` panel that has no manual `web.panels.events.url` (the URL is derived post-build, after validation, from `dispatch.dispatcher_port`); (2) the derivation emits a bare-host `url` plus a `/dashboard` `path` instead of baking `/dashboard` into `url`, matching the custom-panel proxy convention (`url.rstrip('/') + '/' + path`) so sub-routes are not double-prefixed. A facility-pinned `web.panels.events.path` is preserved, and an explicit `web.panels.events.url` override still wins.

## [2026.6.2] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Runtime panel control for the web terminal** — the agent can show/hide configured panels and register ad-hoc URL panels at runtime (`show_panel`, `hide_panel`, `register_panel`; `list_panels` reports per-panel visibility + active tab). Panels can launch hidden (`web.panels.<id>.hidden`). Runtime URL registration is off by default (`web.allow_runtime_panels`) with an optional SSRF-validated `web.runtime_panel_allowlist`.
- `osprey query "<prompt>"` — headless, read-only agent run for CI: boots the full MCP + tools stack, exits 0 / 1 / 2 (pass / verdict fail / infra error), `--json` for machine-readable output.
- `osprey skills install osprey-design-philosophy` — bundle OSPREY's design principles as an installable skill for contributors.
- `scripts/benchmark/` — model-capability benchmark: runs the model-driving e2e subset across a model × provider matrix declared in one config, and renders a per-test pass-rate dashboard. Adding a model or provider (e.g. local DeepSeek `ds4`, Ollama, vLLM) is a config edit (#259).
- How-to guide for running the agent on open-weight / self-hosted models and reproducing the benchmark (`docs/how-to/run-open-models`).
- Documented the `claude_code.permissions` profile block (`remove_deny`/`deny`/`allow`/`ask`/`remove_ask`) for overriding the default tool deny list (#292).

### Changed

- Removed the non-functional `on_violation` knob from `control_system.limits_checking` and the `config.yml` templates; limit enforcement is unconditional and fail-closed (an `on_violation` key is now ignored).
- ARIEL `capabilities` MCP tool now documents it is *not* a health check (config-only, never touches the DB); use the `status` tool / `osprey ariel status` for live connectivity.
- All agent-facing timestamps now share one configurable facility timezone (`system.timezone`) — archiver queries, live reads, simulated events, ARIEL logbook, and executed-script run times — rendered with an explicit UTC offset; operator-provided times ("today", "14:32") are read as facility-local. Shipped presets pin `system.timezone: UTC`; set your real zone in production (#286).
- OSPREY logs a one-time startup warning when the container `$TZ` disagrees with `system.timezone` (which stays authoritative).
- ARIEL web upload entries (with attachments) now publish through the facility adapter with the same credential and publish-failure handling as text-only entries (previously always saved local-only). Adapters declare whether publishing needs credentials via a fail-closed `requires_write_auth` property, and the web create form adapts its credential prompt via a new `GET /api/publish-info` endpoint. Attachments are stored in ARIEL only (the OLOG write API cannot accept file uploads).
- `claude-agent-sdk` upgraded to 0.2.106 (bundles CLI 2.1.185); `uv.lock` regenerated (#278).

### Fixed

- The Web Terminal's panel nav bar (WORKSPACE, ARIEL, CHANNELS, LATTICE, …) now scrolls horizontally when the tabs outgrow the header instead of letting the trailing tabs get clipped or slide under the header action buttons on a narrow viewport; the scroll has no visible scrollbar and the action buttons stay pinned on the right.
- ARIEL `semantic_search` now degrades gracefully when semantic search is unavailable (no pgvector table / Ollama) — returns an empty result steering the agent to `keyword_search` instead of a tool failure (#276).
- Workspace gallery now shows new artifacts without a manual refresh: the store index is written atomically (temp file + `os.replace`) and the watcher detects the rename (`on_moved`), so a cross-process reader no longer reads a half-written file (#289).
- Channel Finder in-context Explore filter now searches the whole database and re-chunks results, instead of filtering only the displayed page (a match on a later page previously read as "No channels match the filter") (#299).
- ARIEL web Browse pagination now works: `/api/entries` derives an `offset` from `page`, and the declared `author` / `source_system` filters (previously silently ignored) and `total_pages` are now honored.
- `osprey ariel migrate` now creates an embedding table for every model in `enhancement_modules.text_embedding.models`, not just the hardcoded default; previously configured non-default models were dropped and `osprey ariel enhance` produced no embeddings.
- The `control-assistant` **EVENTS** tab now renders in `osprey web` — `events` is now a custom URL-backed panel (it was registered as built-in, so its URL was discarded and the tab never appeared), health-gated against the dispatcher's `/health`.
- The EPICS connector now routes writes through the configured `gateways.write_access` gateway when `control_system.writes_enabled` is true (falling back to `gateways.read_only` otherwise); previously it always used `read_only`, so writes failed on a genuine read-only gateway.
- The channel-limits `defaults` block is now actually inherited — a channel omitting a field (`writable`, `min_value`/`max_value`, `max_step`, `verification`) picks it up from the top-level `defaults` (so `defaults: {writable: false}` takes effect); previously it was validated but dropped.
- Dispatched agent runs now fail fast when the model provider never responds (invalid/expired credential or unreachable base URL): a per-message inactivity watchdog (`DISPATCH_INACTIVITY_SEC`, default 120s) aborts a hung run instead of stalling to the 300s timeout.
- Creating an ARIEL logbook entry no longer silently saves local-only when publishing needs credentials or fails: a logbook requiring credentials returns HTTP 401 and the web form prompts (keeping the entry populated); a real publish failure surfaces an error. Only a genuinely read-only adapter falls back to local-only.
- Web-uploaded (ARIEL-only) attachments on a published entry are no longer erased by a later re-ingestion poll — an upsert carrying no attachments preserves the existing ones (a non-empty list still replaces them) (#291).
- `provider=ds4` (local DeepSeek V4) now resolves in the `control_assistant` and `hello_world` presets (the `api.providers` stanza was missing from the app templates).
- Benchmark matrix runs now provision an isolated ARIEL database per model×seed cell, so concurrent cells no longer drop each other's embedding tables mid-test (#259).
- Simulation `at_time` events now fire at the facility wall-clock time-of-day regardless of the deploy host's `$TZ` (previously placed in the box's local zone).
- Seeded and ingested logbook entries now resolve their relative time-of-day in the facility timezone, so on a non-UTC facility the narrative lands at the same wall-clock time as the telemetry (previously anchored in UTC).
- The ARIEL web **API** now returns entry timestamps as facility-local ISO with an explicit offset, matching the MCP path; web and MCP share one rendering helper and the single-entry `get` is localized too.
- Translation proxy (open-model path) now hoists a `role: "system"` message inside `messages` into the OpenAI system message instead of dropping it, so mid-conversation system instructions survive translation.
- `osprey query` / SDK runner / dispatch worker now expand `${VAR}` in a custom provider's `base_url` against the project `.env`, and start the translation proxy on these paths for non-native (OpenAI-protocol) providers; previously the literal `${VAR}` reached the proxy and the request failed to parse as a URL (#307).

## [2026.6.1] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- **Event dispatch (opt-in).** New `osprey.dispatch` FastMCP server + `osprey.mcp_server.dispatch_worker` service turn external events into headless agent runs, with a live dashboard, an in-memory FIFO pool with backpressure, per-trigger tool allowlists, and a server-side tool denylist (shell + web/browser tools blocked regardless of a trigger's allowlist). All dispatcher and worker HTTP endpoints that carry agent output or accept writes are bearer-token gated (the in-terminal EVENTS tab injects the token server-side, so the browser never holds it); `osprey deploy up` auto-generates the tokens into the project `.env` so a fresh deploy is secure with zero editing. Enable per profile via a `dispatch:` block; the `control-assistant` preset ships four control-system-free tutorial triggers (fire `hello-dispatch` with a single `curl`). Trigger sources are pluggable via the `osprey.trigger_sources` entry-point group (built-in: `webhook`, `cron`). Worker containers mount the project `.env` read-only so dispatched agent runs can authenticate to the LLM provider. The pipeline is exercised end-to-end by real-token e2e tests — a subprocess sweep over the shipped triggers and a full Docker-stack deploy. `osprey deploy up` builds a shared local image for the dispatcher + worker from a bundled Dockerfile (no published image required); use `--dev` to bake in a local osprey checkout, or set `OSPREY_DISPATCH_IMAGE`/`OSPREY_WORKER_IMAGE` to use a prebuilt image.
- The `control-assistant` preset now surfaces the event-dispatcher dashboard as an in-terminal **EVENTS** tab in `osprey web` (health-gated; repoint via `EVENT_DISPATCHER_URL`).
- **Facility Knowledge (OKF).** Structured markdown bundle (`osprey_facility_knowledge` MCP server, `list_concepts` / `read_concept` / `search` tools) for on-demand retrieval of subsystem descriptions, device details, operational procedures, and facility-specific references. `facility.md` is thinned to facility identity only; deep content is fetched via the agent on demand. The `control_assistant` preset ships an Example Research Facility bundle. Includes `draft_concept` write tool (approval-gated) for authoring new concept docs directly from an agent session. See :doc:`/how-to/use-facility-knowledge`.
- `osprey knowledge` CLI: `regen-index` (regenerate bundle indexes, idempotent), `validate` (collect-all frontmatter + index validation, exits 1 on any failure), `seed-from-ttl` (seed device stubs from a NARAD/als-ontology TTL; requires `knowledge` extra; `--force` to overwrite hand-edited stubs).
- `facility-knowledge` subagent: specialist agent scoped to `list_concepts` / `read_concept` / `search`; enabled by default in `control_assistant`; delegates facility knowledge lookups out of the main agent's context.
- Simulation engine: `at_time: "HH:MM:SS"` event anchor — daily local-time recurrence for archiver events (step/spike; width in seconds), complementing window-fraction `at` and activation-relative `at_offset`.
- Simulation engine: optional per-channel `min`/`max` physical bounds clamp live reads and synthesized history on the way out (e.g. forward RF power floored at 0 saturates instead of going negative during a trip); overrides and writes are stored verbatim.
- **Composable, self-contained simulation scenarios.** Scenarios are bundles under `data/simulation/scenarios/<name>/` — each owns its telemetry overlay (`scenario.json`) and, optionally, its logbook narrative (`logbook.json`). Several can be active at once as long as they touch disjoint channel sets (overlapping channels are a hard error). The `control_assistant` preset ships `vacuum-burst` (telemetry-only) and `rf-thermal` (with its DEMO-026/027/028 incident arc).
- **`osprey sim` CLI** — `osprey sim list | status | apply NAME...` composes and applies one or more scenarios: it writes the simulator state (with a shared apply-time anchor) and purges + reseeds the ARIEL logbook from the active bundles, so the narrative the agent searches matches the telemetry it reads, against one clock. `apply` confirms before purging (`--yes` to skip, `--no-seed` for telemetry only).
- **Relative timestamps for demo/seed logbooks** (`osprey.utils.relative_time`) — demo and seed entries express timestamps as `{days_ago, time}` and resolve to concrete datetimes when data enters the system (`osprey sim apply` for scenario bundles; `osprey ariel ingest`/`quickstart` for the generic JSON adapter, which now accepts a relative `when` alongside absolute `timestamp`). The data lands at a recent, deterministic position with no build-time file mutation.
- Deterministic statistical-contract tests (`tests/simulation/test_control_assistant_scenarios.py`, `test_scenario_composition.py`) pin the scenarios' signatures (anti-correlation, excursion positions, derived-channel consistency) and the disjoint-composition contract, so the LLM-judge e2e tests run against a known-good data substrate.

### Changed

- Hello-world tutorial now launches via `osprey claude chat` instead of bare `claude`, so the provider configured under `claude_code` is actually used (bare `claude` silently falls back to the shell's provider); links the CLI-chat how-to (#261).
- The control_assistant scenario e2e tests (`test_vacuum_burst_scenario` and `test_rf_cavity_correlation_scenario`) drive their archiver ground truth from the simulation engine via `activate_scenarios`, which also seeds the matching ARIEL logbook deterministically at setup (replacing the manual `purge && ingest` pre-seed and its stale-DB footgun). They build at tier 3 so every simulated channel is discoverable through the channel finder.

### Fixed

- Drop the unused `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` forwarding from the `python` executor MCP server env; nothing in the executor stack reads it (#264).
- `osprey deploy up --dev` now passes `--build` so the freshly-rendered local wheel is actually baked into the image; previously compose reused the cached image and ran stale code after the first build.
- `osprey deploy up --dev` now builds the local wheel with the active interpreter (`sys.executable`) instead of bare `python3`. In a non-activated virtualenv, PATH `python3` is the system/pyenv interpreter, which lacks the `build` package — so the wheel build silently failed and containers fell back to the released PyPI version (missing any unreleased local code).
- `osprey build` no longer aborts when a profile removes a framework agent (e.g. dropping the logbook agents) while also disabling the MCP server those agents depended on. OSPREY's two-pass `.claude/` render left the dropped agents' `.md` files orphaned on disk with their original `mcp__*` tool frontmatter, which the agent tool/permission drift check then flagged as a false positive and aborted the build. Files outside the active manifest selection are now deleted on re-render instead of left behind. (#266)

### Removed

- The build-time logbook timestamp rebase (`rebase_logbook_timestamps`) is gone: demo/seed logbooks now carry declarative relative timestamps resolved at ingest/apply time instead of being mutated in place during `osprey build` (which no longer requires a running Postgres for logbook setup).
- **BREAKING:** the mock archiver no longer emits the built-in Sector-7 vacuum-burst and RF cavity-C1 thermal-excursion demo events from hard-coded source. That physics is now data-driven (ship it as a `machine.json` scenario, e.g. the `control_assistant` preset's `vacuum-burst`/`rf-thermal`). Without a `simulation_file`, the mock archiver synthesizes only generic per-PV-type waveforms.

## [2026.6.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **`ds4` provider** — local DwarfStar/DeepSeek-V4 inference server (OpenAI-compatible, keyless, default `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1`). Introduces a per-provider `supports_native_structured_output` capability flag (`True`/`False`/`None`=auto-detect via LiteLLM) replacing the hardcoded structured-output whitelist; ds4 declares `False` because the server accepts but ignores `response_format: json_schema`, so OSPREY's prompt-based JSON fallback is used. Also fixes URL mangling in the vLLM/ds4 health checks (`rstrip('/v1')` stripped characters, breaking ports ending in `1`).
- **Data-driven simulation engine** (`osprey.simulation`) backing the mock control-system and archiver connectors: a `machine.json` defines channels (baseline values or derived expressions), scenarios (override sets), and archiver event scripts (step/ramp/spike, window-fraction or wall-clock anchored), so corrective writes propagate through physics couplings and archived history correlates with live values. Ships with a generic `sim-scenarios` skill for listing/switching scenarios.
- **Generated reference Dockerfile.** `osprey build` now renders a self-documenting `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` into every project root — install Claude Code + OSPREY, copy the project, relocate paths, serve the web terminal on 8087 as a non-root user. Generated once and user-owned (`regen` never touches them); site extension via exactly three build ARGs (`OSPREY_PIP_SPEC`, `PIP_NO_PROXY`, `OSPREY_OFFLINE`). Profile pip `dependencies:` are baked into the install line. New how-to: `docs/source/how-to/containerize-project.rst`. Guarded by unit content tests, a CLI cross-check (every `osprey` invocation in the rendered Dockerfile must resolve against the real click tree), and a docker-build e2e (`dockerfile-e2e` CI job, advisory).
- **`osprey claude regen --runtime-root PATH`.** Rewrites `project_root` in `config.yml` (comment-preserving) and re-renders Claude Code artifacts against the new root; a recorded `execution.python_env_path` that doesn't exist on the current filesystem is replaced with the current interpreter. Supersedes the manual "clear python_env_path + regen" container fix; used by the generated Dockerfile.
- New e2e scenario `tests/e2e/test_corrector_limit_honest_refusal_scenario.py` — asserts the agent's *behavior under refusal* (no channel-shopping, no intent-splitting, no false success, clear safety-attribution, operator looped in), complementing the existing mechanism-level safety tests. Two-layer grading (deterministic + LLM judge).

### Changed

- **`claude-agent-sdk` upgraded to 0.2.93** (bundles CLI 2.1.167); als-apg routing re-verified (hello-world canonical flow + approval-hook e2e).
- `data-visualizer` subagent now defaults to `create_interactive_plot` when the caller does not explicitly request a static figure. Fixes the case where vague requests (e.g. "3D waterfall plot") produced an unreadable fixed-viewpoint matplotlib image instead of a rotatable Plotly view.

### Fixed

- The Claude Code translation proxy (used to route OpenAI-protocol providers through `osprey claude` and the web terminal) now pools a single upstream `httpx` client for the app's lifetime and closes it via a FastAPI lifespan handler, instead of opening and tearing down a connection per request. Under sustained load the per-request client exhausted the host's ephemeral-port pool via accumulated `TIME_WAIT` sockets; the pooled client (20 keepalive / 100 max connections, 30s expiry) fixes the exhaustion.
- E2E SDK harness now waits for MCP servers to finish their async handshake before sending the prompt. The OSPREY `controls` stdio server cold-starts ~1.5s after launch (slower than `python`/`osprey_workspace`); under load an agent's first turn could beat it, see no controls tools, and give up — a flaky failure misattributed to model capability. Both `run_sdk_query` and `run_sdk_query_with_hooks` now poll `ClaudeSDKClient.get_mcp_status()` until the project's declared servers report `connected`, and capture that snapshot on the result (`mcp_server_status`/`registered_tools`/`tool_was_registered`, optional per-test sidecar via `OSPREY_E2E_INIT_SIDECAR`) so a missing tool is provably infrastructure rather than a silent model give-up.
- `ariel search` CLI now renders keyword-search entries when no composed answer is available, instead of printing an empty result.
- `osprey build` re-anchors profile-overlaid logbook seeds to the current date (overlays land after the in-template timestamp rebase).
- Editing `config.yml` no longer leaves the agent running stale settings (#244). Config changes via the web settings panel and `osprey config set-*` now auto-regenerate the Claude Code artifacts (so e.g. flipping `control_system.writes_enabled` actually takes effect), the web server re-syncs them on launch, and a SessionStart guard warns when a hand-edited `config.yml` has drifted from the generated `.claude/` artifacts. The hello-world tutorial documents the `osprey claude regen` + relaunch step.
- Regen drift detection (`osprey claude status` and the auto-regen gate above) no longer reports phantom drift for user-owned artifacts (e.g. the create-only `facility.md`), which would have re-rendered and backed up artifacts on every web launch.
- `lttb_downsample()` no longer crashes (`TypeError`) on archiver `None` gap values; gaps are treated as `0.0` for downsample selection and preserved as `null` in the returned data so charts render true gaps (#247).
- `rules/data-visualization.md` is now gated on the data-visualizer subagent being disabled. When the subagent is enabled (the default), CLAUDE.md forbids the main agent from calling `create_static_plot` / `create_interactive_plot` / `create_dashboard` / `python_execute` / `Write`, so shipping a rule that teaches those tools was contradictory context. The file is now a `.md.j2` template that renders empty (and is auto-unlinked) when the subagent is enabled.
- **Framework safety hooks were silently not launching on hosts without a `python` on `PATH`** (stock macOS, many Linux ship only `python3`). The approval, writes-kill-switch, limits, error-guidance, and feedback PreToolUse/PostToolUse hook commands were rendered as bare `python "..."`, so the whole hook layer failed to start and safety tests passed vacuously. Hooks now render via the project's resolved venv interpreter (`current_python_env`); a new regen test asserts every framework hook command launches via an absolute interpreter path.
- Writes-disabled kill switch now covers the Python executor. When `control_system.writes_enabled` is false, `mcp__python__execute` is pulled out of `permissions.ask` (it can't be denied wholesale — it has a legitimate read-only path), so the `osprey_writes_check` hook's deny on a read-write execute stands alone. Previously a static `ask` entry drove the call to the Claude Code approval prompt even when the hook denied in parallel (claude-agent-sdk 0.2.93), letting a read-write execute reach the operator instead of being blocked.
- Channel-finder benchmark tier-1 database now includes the vacuum gauge system (`VAC/GAUGE`, 205 → 217 channels) consistently across all three paradigms, regenerated from the `TierSpec` source of truth (previously hand-edited into only the `hierarchical` paradigm, leaving `in_context`/`middle_layer` and the spec out of sync).

### Removed

- Unused `caproto` dependency and stale `osprey generate soft-ioc` hints (command removed in the LangGraph-era cleanup).

## [2026.5.2] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Pin Claude Code CLI version per project. New `claude_code.cli_version` config field; when set, OSPREY launches via `npx -y @anthropic-ai/claude-code@<version>` instead of bare `claude`. Use to insulate projects from upstream CC breakage (#218). Verified by `osprey health`; bypass with `osprey claude chat --no-pin`.
- **MongoDB archiver connector.** New `mongodb_archiver` type for querying MongoDB time-series collections; install via `pip install "osprey-framework[archiver-mongodb]"` and configure with `archiver.type: mongodb_archiver` plus host/database/collection/auth settings. Ports PR #84 (RemiLehe) onto the current registry; documents are expected to have shape `{date: ISODate, PV1: value, PV2: value, ...}`.

### Changed

- Documentation cleanup pass over `docs/source/`: resync getting-started, how-to, architecture, and reference pages with the current codebase; fix stale APIs, config keys, and cross-references accumulated since the native-capabilities migration.
- **`pyepics` promoted to base dependencies.** EPICS connector users no longer need `pip install "osprey-framework[dev]"` to get a working EPICS install; pyepics is used in three production paths (control_system connector, limits_validator, python_executor wrapper).
- **`claude-agent-sdk` upgraded to 0.2.87** (lockfile + venv now match `pyproject.toml`; PR #231 bumped the pin without regenerating the lock). Bundles CLI 2.1.150; CBORG/als-apg/anthropic-direct routing re-verified — the old "0.1.27+ breaks CBORG" warning was stale.

### Fixed

- `BaseStore`: in-process lock fixes a lost-update race between the gallery index-watcher thread and same-process saves.
- `quick_check.sh` / `ci_check.sh` prune stale `__pycache__` + empty dirs so a deleted package can't resurface as a namespace package locally.
- e2e SDK trace collector now reads sub-agent transcripts via `list_subagents`/`get_subagent_messages`. CLI ≥2.1.x stopped streaming sub-agent messages through `query()`, blinding delegation/viz/search e2e tests; they observe sub-agent tool calls again.
- `test_channel_read_archiver_plot_with_audit`: dropped the chronological tool-ordering assertions. Harvested sub-agent traces are appended after the main stream, so `tool_names` isn't time-ordered once the agent delegates (the norm on Haiku); the ordering check failed spuriously even when the workflow was correct and the PNG persisted.
- `test_claude_code_build_integration` archiver+plot tests: dropped the belt-and-suspenders scan of the agent's closing `--print` message for plot/BPM vocabulary. That message is free-form and model-dependent (Haiku sometimes ends with "what next?"), so it flaked while the PNG/data-file artifact assertions — the authoritative workflow check — still passed.
- `hello_world` preset triggered "OSPREY APPROVAL REQUIRED" on `channel_read`. Its `config.yml.j2` shipped without an `approval:` block, so after the `global_mode` removal (May 5) every MCP tool fell through to `default_policy: "always"`. Added the standard per-tool policies (`channel_read: skip`, `channel_write: always`, ...) matching the other presets.
- channel-finder `in_context`/`middle_layer` MCP servers crashed on startup (missing required `workspace_root` arg after RF-001); both now resolve it like the other servers.
- Multi-step agentic-pipeline e2e tests now `@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=2)`: the discover→fetch→plot/persist-artifact tests in `test_sdk_workflows.py` (×3), `test_audit_observability.py`, and `test_data_visualizer.py` (×2). The Haiku orchestrator occasionally (~5%/run) stops before completing the pipeline or persisting the plot. Reruns absorb that stochastic miss while every deterministic assertion stays strict — a real regression fails all attempts. Deterministic safety/approval/delegation e2e tests are intentionally left strict. Adds `pytest-rerunfailures` dev dep.

### Removed

- ARIEL's duplicate Claude Setup tab (`/api/claude-setup` endpoints, `claude-setup.js`, related HTML/CSS). The canonical agent-file editor remains in the web terminal at `web_terminal/routes/config.py`; ARIEL's settings drawer now only edits `config.yml`.

## [2026.5.1] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **Paradigm-agnostic channel finder.** `in_context` / `hierarchical` / `middle_layer` share one tier-resolved query set; `control_assistant` ships all 9 tier DBs so you switch tier per run instead of re-initialising.
- **ARIEL standalone preset.** Logbook deployment without the control-system stack (no channel finder, no archiver, no Python executor). See `docs/source/how-to/ariel/standalone-deployment.rst`.
- **Virtual-accelerator scenarios.** Mock archiver emits seeded correlated events (Sector-7 vacuum burst, RF-cavity-C1 thermal runaway) for operator-style investigation tests. *(Superseded — these are now data-driven simulation scenarios; see the Unreleased "Removed" entry.)*
- **Profile-mode builds.** `osprey build --emit-profile DIR --preset X` scaffolds an editable profile; `extends:` accepts bundled preset names.

### Changed
- **GitHub Flow.** Trunk-based on `main`; `next` retired.
- **BREAKING.** `prompts` → `scaffold` (CLI, web, Python, config). No shim.
- **BREAKING.** ARIEL internal RAG / Agent pipelines removed; drop `pipelines.rag` / `pipelines.agent` from configs.
- **BREAKING.** Channel-finder hierarchical schema: bare-numeric device IDs (`SR:DIAG:BPM:01:…` instead of `SR:DIAG:BPM:BPM01:…`), realistic facility sizes.
- **BREAKING.** `build-interview` skill renamed to `osprey-build-interview`.
- **BREAKING.** `channel_finder_mode="all"` removed.
- `query_channels` MCP tool replaces the `list/get/search_channels` triplet.

### Fixed
- Cleanup batch that should have been in v2026.5.0: `osprey build` after `uv tool install` (#216), `osprey deploy up` on presets with no services, `suffix_map` honoured in channel addresses, ARGO base URL (#214), E2E suite green again on CI, and various polish.

### Removed
- Legacy hierarchical "container" schema, vestigial benchmark CLI flags (`--tier`, `--judge-provider`), `start_typesense.sh`, `tests/cassettes/`, `pull_request_template.md`.

## [2026.5.0] - 2026-04-29

This release retires the LangGraph-based orchestration that powered Osprey
through the 0.x series and rebuilds the framework on top of Claude Code
plus a small fleet of MCP servers. Roughly 475 commits touched almost
every subsystem; the entries below summarize the result rather than each
step. Versioning also changes: Osprey adopts CalVer (`YYYY.MM.MICRO`).
The release machinery is scheme-blind, but downstream parsers that
assume `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` semantics need updating.

### Highlights
- **Claude Code + MCP orchestration.** The LangGraph agent graph,
  pipelines, and supporting plumbing are gone. Agents now run under
  Claude Code, consuming five FastMCP servers (`control_system`,
  `python_executor`, `workspace`, `accelpapers`, `matlab`) and a registry
  of native tools. Hardware writes still require human approval through
  the Claude Code prompt surface.
- **Unified `osprey build`.** `osprey init`, `osprey migrate`, the init
  wizard, `osprey config set-models`, and `osprey tasks` are retired.
  A single `osprey build <name> --preset <preset>` (or
  `osprey build <name> <profile.yml>`) scaffolds projects, with `-O FILE`
  overlays and `--set KEY.PATH=VALUE` overrides composing the final
  profile. Profiles support `extends:` inheritance and a `lifecycle:`
  section for build-time commands.
- **First-class skills.** `build-interview` and `osprey-build-deploy`
  ship as installable Claude Code skills via `osprey skills install`. New
  `lattice-evaluation` skill orchestrates nonlinear-dynamics analysis
  (resonance diagram, dynamic aperture, frequency map).
- **Agent-agnostic framing.** Documentation, the landing page, and the
  architecture diagrams are rewritten around the Claude-Code-plus-MCP
  story. ALS-specific agents and servers moved out to facility profiles.

### Breaking changes
- LangGraph removed entirely — source, dependencies, CI hooks, templates,
  and tests. There is no compatibility shim; downstream projects pinning
  LangGraph nodes will not import.
- `osprey init`, `osprey migrate`, `osprey tasks`, `osprey config
  set-models`, and the interactive init wizard are removed. Use
  `osprey build` for all scaffolding.
- `lattice_design` template removed. Build profiles strictly accept
  `{hello_world, control_assistant}`.
- `migrate-legacy` skill removed; the legacy-project migration flow is
  now a path inside `build-interview`.
- Generators / code-generator concept, Karma analytics, the Grafana/OTEL
  monitoring stack, the DePlot service, the graph-analyst agent, and the
  direct-channel-finder MCP server are retired or archived.
- `archivertools` dependency dropped in favor of direct HTTP to the
  EPICS Archiver Appliance.
- Manifest schema → 1.2.0. `.osprey-manifest.json` records `build_args`
  (renamed from `init_args`) with a `source: "preset"|"profile"`
  discriminator; `creation.registry_style` is removed. No reader shim.
- Versioning: SemVer → CalVer (`YYYY.MM.MICRO`).
- Default LLM provider: `cborg` (LBNL-only) → `anthropic`.
- Workspace and agent-data directories unified under `_agent_data`
  (`agent_data.base_dir`); the previous `osprey-workspace/` layout is
  gone.

### Migration guide
- **Existing 0.x project →** run `build-interview` in Claude Code to
  reverse-engineer a build profile from the project, then
  `osprey build <name> <profile.yml>`. The build-interview migration
  phase walks per-service decomposition (jupyter, open-webui, pipelines,
  postgres, ariel) and ends with a smoke-import + `osprey audit` check.
- **Custom LangGraph nodes →** rewrite as MCP tools. The
  `python_executor`, `workspace`, and `control_system` servers are the
  intended extension surfaces.
- **Custom connectors →** override `write_multiple_channels()` if you
  need atomic batch semantics; the default is sequential.
- **Pinning models →** prefer tier names (`haiku` / `sonnet` / `opus`)
  in config; `resolve_model_id()` maps them to provider-specific IDs at
  runtime.

### Added
- **Build & deploy.** `osprey build` with preset overlays and profile
  inheritance, relocatable builds (`--runtime-root`), background
  deployment (`--detach` / `osprey web stop`), CI-friendly flags
  (`--skip-deps`, `--stream`), per-step lifecycle timeouts,
  `requires_osprey_version` profile field, `.env.template` generation,
  auto-install of profile dependencies, and `osprey audit` for project
  safety auditing.
- **Connectors.** `write_multiple_channels()` batch-write hook;
  defense-in-depth `writes_enabled` enforcement via `__init_subclass__`;
  protocol-aware safety rules covering 15 protocols; centralized
  connector type strings; EPICS Archiver Appliance via direct HTTP.
- **Channel Finder.** Web UI with tree preview, multi-select sector
  chips, inline description editing, delete-impact dialog, feedback
  management with pending-review workflow, address resolution, DuckDB
  and Google Sheets backends, and a device-info endpoint.
- **Lattice design.** Interactive lattice dashboard with live optics
  visualization, drag-and-drop panel layout, theme-aware Plotly
  rendering, configurable settings sidebar; bisection-based LMA with
  12-sector auto-detection; ALS-U accumulator ring lattice; nonlinear
  dynamics skills (`resonance-diagram`, `dynamic-aperture`,
  `frequency-map`) and the `lattice-evaluation` orchestration skill.
- **Web Terminal.** PTY session pool for fast switching, session
  persistence and resume, theme system, memory panel and prompt gallery,
  activity diagnostics panel (agent / log / summary / chat), safety
  guidelines page, agent timeline, REST `/api/chat` endpoint, welcome
  modal with version display, and effort-level control via config and
  CLI.
- **Custom panels.** Template-driven panel configuration; WebSocket and
  reverse-proxy support for containerized companion servers; iframe
  embedding contract via `basePath` and `X-Forwarded-Prefix`;
  `list_panels` / `switch_panel` MCP tools.
- **ARIEL.** Bidirectional facility-adapter writes (atomic local JSON
  append, olog RPC POST); per-user OLOG credentials via web form;
  multi-artifact compose with model tiers; `logbook-search` sub-agent;
  artifact-to-attachment converter registry; sync command and publish
  tool.
- **MCP servers.** MATLAB Middle Layer server; `python_executor`
  `execute_file` tool; `workspace` `data_context_read` and
  `artifact_get`; HTTP / SSE / streamable-http transport support; native
  textbook file access replacing the prior textbooks MCP server.
- **Skills.** `build-interview` (with friction-log capture, migration
  path, and Phase 8 install verification), `osprey-build-deploy`,
  `lattice-evaluation`, `analyze-working-point`, `demo-gallery`, and a
  `setup-mode` diagnostic.
- **Providers.** AMSC; per-project Claude Code provider isolation;
  OpenAI-compatible-only providers; tier-name resolution
  (`haiku` / `sonnet` / `opus`); provider-registry overhaul.
- **Vendor & offline.** Manifest-driven vendor assets via
  `osprey vendor fetch`; CDN by default with `OSPREY_OFFLINE=1` opt-in
  for firewalled deployments; `--insecure` for corporate proxies
  (verified against per-asset SHA256); bundled Google Fonts.
- **Safety & permissions.** Per-tool approval policies; structured
  limits errors; facility-configurable `settings.json` permissions with
  drag-and-drop editor; memory-guard hook; configurable artifact
  categories per build profile; `OSPREY_HOOK_DEBUG` activity logging.
- **CI.** Doc-executability gate that builds a wheel from the current
  SHA, installs it on a clean Ubuntu runner, and runs the bash blocks
  extracted from `installation.rst` / `build-interview.rst`. Tiered MCP
  boot-smoke and preset-agentic test pyramid.

### Changed
- Documentation rewritten around the MCP architecture (installation,
  tutorial, architecture, deploy, MCP servers, build profiles); landing
  page and data-flow diagram refreshed.
- AccelPapers search migrated from SQLite FTS5 to Typesense (hybrid
  BM25 + vector); embedding URL / model / key configurable via env.
- Stores moved to `osprey.stores/`; MCP servers consolidated under
  `mcp_server/`; large modules (`web_terminal/routes.py`,
  `registry/manager.py`, `deployment/container_manager.py`,
  `cli/templates.py`, `cli/interactive_menu.py`) split into focused
  packages.
- Build-profile validation: unknown top-level keys warn (will hard-fail
  in a future release); unknown `web_panels` hard-fail today.
- CBORG model IDs pinned to versioned aliases so Claude Code negotiates
  the correct API schema.

### Fixed
- Datetime normalization, NaN sanitization in archiver and artifact
  responses, and async-safe PV reads (carried over from the 0.11.5 line).
- Numerous web-terminal panel-proxy edge cases for iframe embedding,
  WebSocket forwarding, and corporate-proxy bypass.
- `osprey build` now exits with status 2 (usage error) for unknown
  presets, matching the documented contract.

### Changed (Benchmarks)
- **Benchmarks**: `format_in_context()` now returns `{_metadata, channels}` envelope with auto-generated aliases (`channel`) and PV addresses (`address`) instead of a plain list — **breaking change** for code that directly parses the in-context JSON as a list
- **Benchmarks**: `format_middle_layer()` now generates `_setup` blocks (`CommonNames`, `DeviceList`, `ElementList`) for every family, enabling sector filtering
- **Benchmarks**: `validate_queries()` supports per-tier validation via `tier_queries` parameter; backward-compatible with single-file mode
- **Benchmarks**: `BenchmarkRun.paradigm` / `tier` now `Optional` (defaults `None`) — single-backend consumers no longer need synthetic labels
- **Benchmarks**: `BenchmarkSuite` slimmed to bundle role; `AggregatedCell` and matrix-aggregation helpers (`aggregate_by_cell`, `to_table`, `MODEL_PRICES_PER_MTOK`, `infer_cost_usd`) moved to companion paper repo
- **Benchmarks**: `evaluate_response()` and `BenchmarkRunner` gain `use_llm_judge` flag (default `False`) — Stage 2 LLM precision judge is now true opt-in

### Removed (Benchmarks paper-split)
- **Benchmarks**: Cross-paradigm orchestration scripts, tier datasets, and archived result artifacts moved to companion paper repo (`~/LBL/ML/osprey-cf-paper`)
- **Benchmarks**: 9 dev-residue benchmark/debug scripts (`bench_test*`, `bench_matrix`, `bench_warmth`, `debug_benchmark_scaffold`, `trace_single_query`, `migrate_benchmark_filenames`, `analyze_test_coverage`, `backfill_in_context_tokens`)
- **Tooling**: `scripts/capture_ariel_screenshots.py` → `docs/tooling/` (documentation utility, not a runtime script)

## [0.11.5] - 2026-03-13

- **Open WebUI**: Fix artifacts not showing up in Open WebUI interface (#179)
- **Benchmarks**: Fix channel finder benchmark rate limit handling — make OpenAI retry budget dynamic with `retry_budget_override()` context manager, add agent-level retry in middle layer pipeline, and query-level retry with backoff in benchmark runner
- **Config**: `.env` file now overrides existing environment variables (`load_dotenv(override=True)`) so `.env` is the source of truth for API keys

## [0.11.4] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **ARIEL**: Bidirectional facility adapter write support (#174)
  - Rename `BaseAdapter` → `FacilityAdapter` with backwards-compatible alias; add `supports_write` and `create_entry()` to adapter interface
  - Implement write path for `GenericJSONAdapter` (atomic local JSON append) and `ALSLogbookAdapter` (olog RPC XML POST with retry)
  - `ARIELSearchService.create_entry()` orchestrates writes to facility logbook first, then optimistic local upsert with re-ingestion sync
  - New models: `FacilityEntryCreateRequest`, `FacilityEntryCreateResult`, `SyncStatus`, `WriteConfig`

- **Web Terminal**: Session diagnostics panel (Activity tab) with agent, log, summary, and chat views; local safety guidelines page

### Fixed
- **AccelPapers**: Fix double-path 404 in Typesense auto-embedding — URL was `http://localhost:11434/v1/embeddings` but Typesense appends `/v1/embeddings` itself
- **Hooks**: Deterministic project dir resolution via `hook_input["cwd"]` (replaces inconsistent env var fallback chains)
- **Hooks**: Dynamic `write_tools` for writes kill switch — custom MCP server write tools now blocked when `writes_enabled: false` (GP-003)

- **AccelPapers**: Migrated search backend from SQLite FTS5 to Typesense for hybrid BM25 + vector search
- **MCP Servers**: Consolidate all 9 MCP servers under `mcp_server/` — moved ARIEL MCP from `interfaces/ariel/mcp/` and 3 channel finder MCPs from `services/channel_finder/mcp/` (RF-005)
- **AccelPapers**: Embedding URL, model, and API key now configurable via `ACCELPAPERS_OLLAMA_URL`, `ACCELPAPERS_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `ACCELPAPERS_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` env vars; `--data-dir` falls back to `ACCELPAPERS_DATA_DIR`; added `--ollama-url` CLI flag

### Fixed
- **CI**: Make E2E test failures non-blocking in gate job — E2E tests are LLM-dependent and fail due to API rate limits, not code issues
- **Tests**: Mark flaky `test_first_order_backend_multiple_setpoint_changes` as `xfail` on macOS CI runners due to intermittent caproto server timeouts

## [0.11.3] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Providers**: Add American Science Cloud (AMSC) as LLM provider (#170)

### Fixed
- **Safety**: Block retry on channel limits violation — LLM could previously retry around a safety-blocked write, now sets `is_failed=True` to prevent workaround attempts

  - Pre-dispatch dependency validation to prevent premature capability execution
- **Events**: Add unified typed event system replacing dict-based logging
  - 18 typed dataclass events across 7 categories: status, phase lifecycle, data output, capability, LLM, tool/code, and control flow

  - Rename `get_role_definition()` / `get_task_definition()` → `get_role()` / `get_task()` with deprecation bridges
  - Add `build_dynamic_context(**kwargs)` for runtime context injection (current datetime, user queries, channel mappings)
  - Move `channel_write` and `time_range_parsing` hardcoded runtime prompts (~300 lines) into builder `get_instructions()` + `build_dynamic_context()` methods

- **Generators**: Fix `config_updater` functions returning wrong type
  - `set_control_system_type()`, `set_epics_gateway_config()`, `update_all_models()`, and `add_capability_react_to_config()` now return `(updated_content, preview)` tuple as expected by CLI callers
- **Channel Finder**: Fix string ChannelNames causing character-by-character iteration
  - MATLAB Middle Layer exports may produce bare strings (e.g., `"SR:DCCT"`) instead of single-element arrays
  - Without the fix, iterating over string produces `['S', 'R', ':', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'T']` instead of `['SR:DCCT']`

#### Infrastructure Node Instance Method Migration
- **All 7 infrastructure nodes** migrated from static method pattern to instance method pattern
- Aligns infrastructure nodes with capability node implementation
- **Decorator Enhancements**:
  - Automatic detection of static vs instance methods (backward compatible)
  - Runtime injection of `_state` for all infrastructure nodes
  - Selective `_step` injection only for in-execution nodes (clarify, respond)
  - Defensive None checks for step injection with warning logs
  - Validation for invalid method types (classmethod, property)
- **Migrated Nodes**:
  - Router: Minimal state usage, routing metadata
  - Task Extraction: Data source integration, state refs updated
  - Classification: Extensive state usage (100+ refs), bypass mode
  - Clarify: First `_step` injection, task_objective extraction
  - Respond: `_step` injection, response generation
  - Error: NO `_step` injection (uses `StateManager.get_current_step_index()`)
  - Orchestration: 200+ lines, nested functions via closure
- **Testing**: Added 15 unit tests for infrastructure pattern
  - Tests validate decorator injection logic (_state, _step)
  - Tests verify backward compatibility with static methods
  - All tests passing

#### Capability Instance Method Pattern Testing
- Added 12 comprehensive tests for migrated capabilities
- New test directory: `tests/capabilities/` with fixtures and integration tests
- Memory Capability Tests (4 tests): signature validation, state/step injection, decorator integration
- Python Capability Tests (3 tests): instance method pattern validation
- TimeRangeParsing Capability Tests (5 tests): full end-to-end integration
- All tests formatted with black and linted

#### Instance Method Pattern for Capabilities
- **New Recommended Pattern**: Capabilities can now use instance methods instead of static methods
  - Helper methods available via `self`: `get_required_contexts()`, `get_task_objective()`, `get_parameters()`, `store_output_context()`
  - Eliminates ~60% of boilerplate code in capability implementations
  - More intuitive and Pythonic API design
  - Full backward compatibility maintained - static methods still work
- **Automatic Context Extraction**: `get_required_contexts()` method with tuple unpacking support
  - Matches order of `requires` field for elegant unpacking: `data, time = self.get_required_contexts()`
  - Falls back to dict access when preferred: `contexts = self.get_required_contexts(); data = contexts["DATA"]`
  - Automatic extraction with cardinality validation
- **New Helper Methods** in `BaseCapability`:
  - `get_required_contexts()` - Extract required contexts with automatic validation
  - `get_task_objective()` - Get current task description
  - `get_parameters()` - Get step parameters
  - `store_output_context()` - Store single output context
  - `store_output_contexts()` - Store multiple output contexts
- **Runtime State Injection**: `@capability_node` decorator injects `_state` and `_step` at runtime
  - Available within `execute()` method context
  - Clean separation between class definition and runtime state
- **Migration Guide**: Comprehensive documentation for upgrading from static to instance pattern
  - Side-by-side code comparisons
  - Migration checklist
  - Common issues and solutions
  - Gradual migration strategy
  - Located at: `docs/source/developer-guides/migration-guide-instance-methods.rst`

  - Capabilities declare requirements with cardinality: `requires = [("CONTEXT_TYPE", "single")]`
  - Framework automatically validates and raises clear errors if violated
  - Eliminates repetitive `isinstance(context, list)` checks in capability code
  - Options: `"single"` (exactly one), `"multiple"` (must be list), or plain string (any cardinality)
  - Works seamlessly with `get_required_contexts()` helper method
  - Added 9 comprehensive test cases for cardinality validation
  - Updated all framework capability templates to use new pattern

### Changed
- **Generator Architecture**: Refactored monolithic generator into modular design
  - Split MCP capability generator into `BaseGenerator`, `MCPCapabilityGenerator`, and `PromptCapabilityGenerator`

  - Improved CLI with lazy imports for better performance
  - Better separation of concerns and extensibility
- **Clarification System**: Improved prompt structure and context extraction
  - Enhanced clarification prompt builder with better orchestrator integration
  - Improved `get_system_instructions()` method for cleaner prompt composition
  - Better task_objective prioritization in clarification queries
- **Mock Archiver Connector**: Improved BPM position data generation
  - BPM positions now use realistic ±100 µm equilibrium offsets with ±10 µm oscillations
  - Each BPM has unique, reproducible random characteristics based on PV name
  - Slow drift patterns simulate realistic beam position variations

- **Weather Template**: Fixed context extraction example in hello world weather template (PR #26)
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: `ContextManager.extract_from_step()` now correctly handles multiple contexts of the same type
  - Previously, when multiple contexts of the same type were requested (e.g., two `CURRENT_WEATHER` contexts), only the last one was returned, causing silent data loss
  - Now returns a list when multiple contexts of the same type exist: `{"CURRENT_WEATHER": [ctx1, ctx2]}`
  - Single contexts still returned as objects for backward compatibility: `{"CURRENT_WEATHER": ctx_obj}`
  - Capabilities can check `isinstance(context, list)` to detect and handle multiple contexts
  - Added 17 comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios
- **Interactive Menu Registry Contamination** ([#29](https://github.com/als-apg/osprey/issues/29))
  - Fixed bug where creating multiple projects in the same interactive menu session caused capability contamination

  - Added `reset_registry()` calls in `handle_chat_action()` before launching chat
  - Prevents second project from inheriting capabilities from first project
  - Added comprehensive test suite to verify registry isolation

### Breaking Changes
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `BaseCapabilityContext.get_access_details()` signature simplified
  - **Old:** `get_access_details(self, key_name: Optional[str] = None)` with defensive fallback
  - **New:** `get_access_details(self, key: str)` - key parameter is required
  - **Reason:** Framework always provides the key; optional parameter was unnecessary defensive programming
  - **Impact:** Custom context classes must update signature
  - **Migration:** Remove `Optional[str] = None` and fallback logic; use `key` parameter directly
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `BaseCapabilityContext.get_summary()` signature simplified
  - **Old:** `get_summary(self, key: str)` - required the storage key
  - **New:** `get_summary(self)` - no parameters needed
  - **Reason:** Summaries describe the context data, not storage details
  - **Impact:** Custom context classes must remove `key` parameter
  - **Migration:** Remove `key` parameter from method signature
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `ContextManager.get_summaries()` now returns `list[dict]` instead of `dict[str, Any]`
  - Simplifies the API by eliminating flattened key format (e.g., `"CONTEXT_TYPE.key"`)
  - Each summary dict already contains a `"type"` field for identification
  - More natural format for UI/LLM consumption
  - Updated 4 consumer files: `respond_node.py`, `clarify_node.py`, `memory.py`, `response_generation.py`

### Migration Notes
- **Early Access Phase**: This is an acceptable breaking change as the framework is in early access (0.9.x)
- **For Capability Developers (Cardinality)**: Replace `isinstance(context, list)` checks with cardinality constraints
  - Old: `constraints=["PV_ADDRESSES"]` + manual `isinstance` check
  - New: `constraints=[("PV_ADDRESSES", "single")]` - framework handles validation
- **For Capability Developers (Multi-Context)**: Add `isinstance(context, list)` validation after extracting contexts to ensure your capability behavior matches expectations (only if not using cardinality constraints)
- **For get_summaries() Consumers**: Update code to iterate over list instead of dict.items()
  - Old: `for key, summary in summaries.items()`
  - New: `for summary in summaries: context_type = summary.get('type')`

### Breaking Changes
- **`get_model_config()` signature changed**: `(model_name, service, model_type, config_path)` → `(model_name, config_path)`
  - **Impact**: Low - Framework model calls are internal and already updated
  - **User Action Required**: Only if you have custom application code using application-specific models
  - **Migration**:
    ```python
    # Old (if you have this in your application code):
    get_model_config('my_app', 'custom_model')

    # New:
    get_model_config('custom_model')
    ```
  - **Note**: Most users will not need to change anything - framework models (orchestrator, classifier, response, etc.) are handled internally

## [0.8.5] - 2025-11-10

### Fixed
- **Python Executor Configuration**: Removed deprecated 'framework' config nesting from python_executor components
- **Subprocess Execution**: Added `CONFIG_FILE` environment variable support for proper registry/context loading in subprocesses

- **Formatting**: Applied automatic ruff formatting fixes for consistency
- **Logging**: Improved logging with reduced verbosity and structured formatting
- **CLI**: Extracted duplicate streaming logic into reusable helper method

## [0.8.4] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- **Registry Modes**: Introduced Standalone and Extend modes for application registries
  - **Extend Mode** (recommended): Applications extend framework defaults via `ExtendedRegistryConfig`
    - Framework components loaded automatically (memory, Python, time parsing, etc.)
    - Applications can add, exclude, or override framework components
    - Returned by `extend_framework_registry()` helper function
    - Reduces boilerplate and simplifies upgrades
  - **Standalone Mode** (advanced): Applications provide complete registry including all framework components
    - Framework registry is NOT loaded
    - Full control over all components
    - Used when `RegistryConfig` is returned directly (not via helper)
  - Mode detection is automatic based on registry type (`isinstance(config, ExtendedRegistryConfig)`)
- **New Class**: `ExtendedRegistryConfig` marker class for signaling Extend mode
  - Subclass of `RegistryConfig` with identical fields
  - Type-based detection enables automatic framework merging
  - Added to `__all__` exports in `osprey.registry`
- **New Helper Function**: `generate_explicit_registry_code()` for template generation
  - Generates complete registry Python code combining framework + app components
  - Used by CLI template system for creating explicit registries
  - Useful for applications that want full visibility of all components
  - Takes app metadata and component lists, returns formatted Python source code
- Comprehensive test suite for registry modes (500+ lines across 4 new test files)
  - `test_registry_modes.py`: Tests for Extend vs Standalone mode detection
  - `test_registry_loading.py`: Tests for registry loading mechanisms
  - `test_registry_helpers.py`: Tests for helper functions
  - `test_registry_validation.py`: Tests for registry validation

### Changed
- **Registry Helper**: `extend_framework_registry()` now returns `ExtendedRegistryConfig` instead of `RegistryConfig`
  - Backward compatible (ExtendedRegistryConfig is a subclass of RegistryConfig)
  - Type signature change enables automatic mode detection
  - Applications using type hints should update return type annotation
- Enhanced registry documentation with comprehensive coverage of both modes
  - Developer guide updated with mode selection guidance
  - API reference documentation expanded with ExtendedRegistryConfig details
  - Code examples updated to show ExtendedRegistryConfig return type

### Breaking Changes
- **RegistryManager Constructor**: Parameter changed from `registry_paths: List[str]` to `registry_path: Optional[str]`
  - **Impact**: Low - most applications use `initialize_registry()` which reads from config
  - **Migration**: Change `RegistryManager([path1, path2])` to `RegistryManager(path)` for single registry
  - **Rationale**: Simplified to single-application model matching actual usage patterns
  - Framework now supports one application registry per instance (loaded from `config.yml`)
- **Type Signature**: `extend_framework_registry()` return type changed to `ExtendedRegistryConfig`
  - **Impact**: Very low - backward compatible at runtime (subclass relationship)
  - **Migration**: Update type hints from `-> RegistryConfig` to `-> ExtendedRegistryConfig`
  - Only affects code using explicit type checking

### Removed
