/**
 * ESLint rule: ban `// @ts-nocheck` line directives.
 *
 * `tsconfig.json` type-checks every file under its include glob with
 * `checkJs`, so a surviving `// @ts-check` header is a redundant no-op — but
 * a leading `// @ts-nocheck` opts a file out of `tsc` entirely, and nothing
 * else caps that list. This rule closes that hole by reporting the directive
 * wherever `tsc` actually honors it.
 *
 * Matches `tsc` 7.0's real acceptance grammar (verified): it honors a
 * `// @ts-nocheck` LINE comment anywhere in the leading comment block — not
 * just line 1, and with or without a space after `//`. It does NOT honor the
 * block form `/* @ts-nocheck *\/` or a mid-line prose mention. So this rule
 * fires on every Line comment whose trimmed text starts with `@ts-nocheck`
 * and ignores Block comments and prose. Over-matching (a comment that merely
 * starts with the directive) is the safe direction; under-matching would make
 * the ban bypassable.
