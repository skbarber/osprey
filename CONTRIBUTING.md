# Contributing to Osprey Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Osprey! 🎉

This document provides a quick start guide. For comprehensive contribution guidelines, please visit our **[full Contributing Guide in the documentation](https://als-apg.github.io/osprey/contributing/)**. That site documents the most recent release; if you are working against `main`, read the **[development docs for `main`](https://als-apg.github.io/osprey/latest/)** instead, which carry a development banner.

## Quick Start

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/osprey.git
cd osprey
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Install all development dependencies (creates .venv automatically)
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs
```

**Optional — enable local pre-commit checks.** If you'd like formatting and
whitespace issues caught *before* you push (rather than auto-fixed by the bot
on your PR), run this once per machine:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

After that, `git commit` will automatically run ruff and basic file-hygiene
checks on your staged files. You can skip this step entirely — `pre-commit.ci`
will auto-fix common issues on your PR either way. Recommended for frequent
contributors; safe to ignore otherwise.

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Make Changes and Test

```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e -v

# Run linters
ruff check src/ tests/
ruff format --check src/ tests/
```

**Changelog.** If your change touches `src/` or `packages/`, add a fragment — a
small file such as `changelog.d/1234.fixed.md` describing the change for users.
CI checks for it; see [`changelog.d/README.md`](changelog.d/README.md). Don't
add entries to `CHANGELOG.md` by hand — fragments are folded in when a release
is cut.

### 5. Submit Pull Request

- Push your branch to GitHub
- Open a Pull Request with a clear description
- Address review feedback

## Claude Code Workflow Skill (Optional but Recommended)

If you use [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code), install
the bundled `osprey-contribute` skill to get guided help with this workflow:

```bash
uv run osprey skills install osprey-contribute
```

It walks you through branching, commits, push, PR, and CI iteration following
the conventions on this page — including the protected-branch reality on
`main` (no direct pushes; required CI checks that admins cannot bypass). Once
installed, just open Claude Code in the repo and describe what you want to
contribute; the skill picks up wherever you are in the journey.

Other available skills (`osprey skills install --help` lists them all):
`osprey-build-interview`, `osprey-pre-commit`, `osprey-release`.

## Branch Strategy

Osprey uses **GitHub Flow**: `main` is the single long-lived branch and is always the PR target. Releases are CalVer tags (`vYYYY.M.P`) on `main` — there is no separate `develop`, `release/*`, or `next` branch. Hotfixes follow the same flow: branch from the tag or from `main`, open a PR back to `main`, and tag a follow-up release.

For details (CI gates, branch protection, release cuts) see the [full Contributing Guide](https://als-apg.github.io/osprey/contributing/).

## Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test improvements

## Code Standards

- Follow PEP 8 (100 character line length)
- Use Ruff for linting and formatting
- Add tests for new functionality
- Write Google-style docstrings
- Update documentation as needed

## Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests, in parallel — this is what CI runs
pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e -n 4 --dist loadgroup

# Serial, for debugging a single failure
pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e -v

# E2E tests (requires API keys)
pytest tests/e2e/ -v
```

Because the unit suite runs across four worker processes, a test that changes
process-global state can break an unrelated test. **Before writing tests, read
[`tests/README`](tests/README.md)** — it covers the isolation-fixture house
style, the patching rules, logging and `caplog`, ports and containers, and the
checklist for adding a new batch of tests.

## Front-End JavaScript Tooling

The browser interfaces ship a small dev/CI-only JS toolchain. It is **not**
needed to install or run OSPREY — only if you edit front-end JavaScript. It
requires Node LTS.

```bash
# One-time: install the dev-only toolchain
npm install

# Type-check the JS (tsc --noEmit)
npm run typecheck

# Lint the JS (eslint — house style + a per-file LOC cap)
npm run lint

# Run the JS unit tests (Vitest)
npm run test:js
```

All three run in CI (the `frontend-js` job); any failure blocks the merge.

**Type-checking is on by default.** `tsconfig.json` sets `checkJs: true`, so every
JS file under the interface and test globs is type-checked — no per-file opt-in,
which makes a `// @ts-check` header a redundant no-op. The one directive that still
changes behavior is `// @ts-nocheck`, which opts a file out of `tsc` entirely. That
directive is **machine-banned**: the custom `local/no-ts-nocheck` rule fails
`npm run lint` on any `// @ts-nocheck` line comment — anywhere in the file, with or
without a space after `//` — across interface and test JS. Type-clean the file instead.

**No file-scoped exemptions remain.** Every interface and test JS file is fully
type-checked and lint-clean; `eslint.config.js` carries no per-file `off` blocks.
The house rules (`no-var`, `prefer-const`, `eqeqeq`, the 450-line `max-lines` cap,
`no-unused-vars`, and `local/no-ts-nocheck`) run at `error` across all interface and
test JS, so any fresh violation fails CI immediately.

A localized one-off residual uses an inline `// eslint-disable-next-line <rule> --
<reason>` at the site instead of a file-wide exemption.

## Building Documentation

```bash
cd docs
make html
```
